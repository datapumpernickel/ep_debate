<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, when we debated this proposal at the February part-session I said that the Commission would base its modified proposal on what Parliament voted. I believe you will see that we have honoured that commitment in the text adopted by the College today. We have endeavoured to respect the consensus you have reached on some of the key articles. You will find the amendments you have voted to Article 16 – freedom to provide services – and Article 17 – derogations from freedom to supply services – reflected in the modified proposal. We have excluded all healthcare from the scope of the proposal and, in line with the commitment given, we will come forward with a separate initiative on the health sector. The modified proposal also provides for the exclusion of taxation, temporary work agencies, security services and the audiovisual sector from the scope of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue on scope where we did not follow you is the exclusion of legal services. The Commission considers this is not required given that Article 3 already provides that in case of conflict between a specific directive and this proposal it is the former that will prevail. In addition, we have brought the wording on the exercise of an official authority in line with Article 45 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We have based the exclusion of social services on the various amendments you adopted in this regard. I am sure you will agree that any exclusion must be clearly defined, and this is what we have attempted to do.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to avoid diverging interpretation in Member States, then we must provide legal certainty. The text of the modified proposal specifies that the exclusion from the directive concerns those social services relating to social housing, children and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state. In addition, the Commission will come forward in the next few weeks with a communication on social services of general interest, reflecting the importance these services have for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to remove all interaction between the services proposal and labour law has in my opinion been one of the most important elements in creating a more positive atmosphere around this new services proposal. This has allowed us to move on from the allegations of lowering of social standards and threats to the European social model. While this perception was wrong, it did not go away, and poisoned the debate on this important proposal. In any event, the modified proposal is clear in this regard: labour law is completely removed. As part of the fallout from this, Articles 24 and 25 have been removed from the modified proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I said during the debate in February, the Commission would come forward with a communication to address the issues surrounding the posting of workers, which Articles 24 and 25 were designed to address. In a moment my colleague Vladimir Špidla will outline to you the approach the Commission adopted today. I just want to add that this communication is a vital element in our efforts to reach agreement in the Council on the services proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other issues in the modified proposal that I want to highlight. We have clarified in Article 3 that all special laws take precedence over the provisions of the services proposal. In particular, we have made it clear in Article 3 that the directive does not affect private international law and that, as a consequence, consumers will in principle benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rule laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State. The Commission has also accepted that the professional liability insurance in Article 27 should be optional instead of compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Parliament voted in February, there has been a growing realisation throughout the European Union that the consensus you achieved was the basis for taking this debate forward. Heads of Government at the European Council two weeks ago supported this. We have a window of opportunity for building on this growing consensus. I want to see the potential for growth and jobs that this proposal will bring realised as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now present this modified proposal to the informal Competitiveness Council in Graz later this month. I feel confident that, with the active support of the Austrian Presidency and Member States, we stand a real chance of making significant progress during this Presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just adopted a communication containing instructions and explanations for Member States in respect of the posting of workers within the context of the cross-border provision of services. The communication also includes proposals aimed at helping the Member States to improve the practical implementation of administrative cooperation, access to information and supervising adherence to the directive on the posting of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission announced this communication last February following voting on the Services Directive in the European Parliament, stating at the time that any annulment of Articles 24 and 25, which contain provisions on administrative obstacles to the posting of workers, would be decided on the basis of majority voting. The removal of these articles should not, however, be interpreted by Member States as meaning that they can introduce or retain excessive administrative obstacles against companies that are posting workers across national boundaries. The cross-border posting of workers is regulated under Directive 96/71/EC, the aim of which is to harmonise, on the one hand, the right of companies to provide cross-border services, and on the other hand the rights of workers temporarily posted to another state in order to provide services. The Directive is the main instrument for ensuring the free movement of services, and at the same time the main instrument for preventing social dumping. The legal explanation approved by the Commission today provides the necessary clarification in respect of which control measures may be used by Member States when monitoring whether the employment conditions set out in the Directive are being upheld. The aim is to ensure that Member States act in accordance with the principle of freedom of movement for services, while at the same time avoiding social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication provides explanations and instructions for four types of control measure in particular: the requirement to obtain permission, the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State, the duty to declare and duties in respect of documents dealing with social and employment conditions. The conclusions of the communication are as follows: the obligation to have a representative on the territory of the host Member State is regarded as somewhat excessive, and it is considered sufficient if some of the workers – for example a manager – are appointed as contacts for the relevant authorities in the Member States. It is not considered reasonable that the duty to make a preliminary systematic declaration should be applied only on the grounds that a posted service is involved; the duty to retain documents is, of course, acknowledged, but this should apply only to documents that are absolutely necessary and which enable the authorities in the Member State to carry out effective support and control activities. It does not apply, for example, to social insurance documents, because these are dealt with under Directive 1408/71/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also concluded that it is reasonable to request the preliminary notification of activities. Notifications must be made no later than the day on which the activities commence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to have easier access to information on employment conditions for workers and companies, and improved levels of cooperation between intra-state authorities. It is also essential to improve the resources available to workers and companies, in order to ensure the effective enforcement of employee regulations. On the basis of a study into the operation of the Directive which the Commission carried out and which can be found in the report from the Commission unit, we concluded that there is still much room for improvement in all areas, and the communication contains several proposals specified by the Member States for addressing these shortcomings. These include improvements to websites and other information resources, further resources for contact points and the bodies responsible for supervising the use of the electronic data transfer systems and improving contacts between work inspectorates. I regard as fairly important the suggestion that it is right for Member States to include in the information they provide details of the responsibilities that firms posting workers must fulfil, and not just general references to the employment law or legal system that applies in the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that the Posting of Workers Directive – provided it is applied correctly – constitutes an adequate and robust instrument for ensuring, on the one hand, the prevention of social dumping, and on the other hand, the free provision of services.</p>

In November, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection sounded the right note by holding out the prospect of a solid and even-handed document, and that is what was actually delivered. Encouraged by the Commission, we tabled proposals for sweeping changes which were subsequently met with a wall-to-wall majority in the plenary meeting. At the European spring summit – for surely that is what we can call it now – the Council congratulated us warmly, and we heard the Council express the wish for work to be continued on a services directive that opens up the markets whilst ensuring there is enough room for social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we heard a detailed Commission position on our proposals and we notice that the Commission has kept its promise and remains very committed to supporting the line this House has taken. The services of general economic interest are retained, although, as we proposed, framed in a structure of their own. While the scope is limited, which is what we want, I would call on the Commissioner to take another look at how we should exactly define those social services. The directive has no impact on labour law whatsoever, and Commissioner Špidla explained the promised guidelines that pertain to the application of the posting of workers directive a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the consumer remains sufficiently protected in the end; the red tape is being trimmed down; and the freedom to provide services, as enshrined in Articles 16 and 17, is guaranteed. Whilst a different cooperation procedure may have been worked out for inspection purposes, we count on the Council to ensure that it works just as well as the one we had proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a balance can be struck. This is something we would like to work towards, and we hope that the Austrian Council Presidency, with whom we are always prepared to enter into dialogue, will lead us to a directive that benefits the self-employed, professionals, consumers of services, consumers, employees, economic growth as a whole and creates many additional jobs. We wish the Council presidency the very best of success, and we are pleased that we did eventually get some positive cooperation out of the Commission.</p>

Commissioner McCreevy, my dear Charlie, as rapporteur and on behalf of my group, let me say how pleased I am that the Commission has kept the promise it made to this House and has done as it was bidden by the overwhelming majority in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that it took hours of work by the <span class="italic">chefs de cabinet </span>yesterday, but the most important law in Europe – second only to the Constitution – is now on the right track. We can accompany it down that road, or ought it to be said that the Commission is following where Parliament leads? What we can say is that a crucial step has been taken in the direction of a social Europe, and I can tell the Commissioner that I am particularly pleased that the main bone of contention – the country of origin principle – has been binned. That is the greatest breakthrough as we work towards a social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very glad that you have done as this House has proposed and removed from the scope of the services directive such important areas as part-time working, security firms, the gambling industry and the whole of the health sector, although there is still a question mark over the exclusion of social services, and we will have to have further discussions on how the Commission's thinking in this respect is actually to be evaluated and interpreted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad that, contrary to what had formerly been feared, the services directive will be treated as secondary to the sectoral directives, something that this House saw as important, particularly in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive. I see what we have achieved as a major success for the people, for the social Europe, and, not least, for this House. By it, we, its Members, have demonstrated that we take seriously our rights in the service of the public. Matters are now in the hands of the Council of Ministers. Just how quickly we get proper legislation will depend on them.</p>

The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would go as far as to say that it represents an advance on the position which the European Parliament adopted, which is a good thing for employment in Europe. The ALDE Group takes the view that creating jobs is the best social structure there is, more so than protecting what we have achieved thus far. Unfortunately, there are a number of factors and sectors that remain excluded, which Member States could exploit in order to protect their own markets. That is what we call protectionism and is likely to result in many legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still container concepts, such as gambling, the audiovisual sector, and the list goes on, and what they cover is left to the Member States to decide. We would have preferred to see a much tighter definition and delineation of what is excluded and what is not. Unfortunately, there is no support for this at the moment, and more time may well be required.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that people will come to realise this. Sometimes, as is the case in France, this can cause problems if you want to reform in order to secure our current achievements and prosperity, not least for the sake of our children. Millions of people are still, every Tuesday, taking to the streets to protest. What a shame! Politicians are there to take long-term decisions and, occasionally, to be re-elected in the very short term. Sometimes, we opt for the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we feel that a step has been taken in the right direction. We supported the proposal at first reading. We hope that some more light will be shed as to why a number of sectors are excluded. For example, as you mentioned yourself, the definitions should become less ambiguous so that it becomes more difficult for Member States to protect their incoming services from others. After all, mobility and dynamism in the economy will need to be improved and strengthened in the internal market if we are to be capable of competing with other large economic regions in the world. I think that that is how we can hold onto our prosperity. I thank you and hope that a positive outcome can be achieved very quickly during the forthcoming Council.</p>

I believe that, given the current state of affairs in Europe, this is a shining example of the fact that parliamentary democracy within the European Union can work and that the Commission can effectively take on board the amendments voted for by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has substantially improved the Commission’s original proposal. That being so, I wish to emphasise the fact that the fundamental objections that we made, and which justified our group’s unanimous vote against it, still remain. They mainly concern two points: the scope of the Directive and the confirmed inclusion of services of general economic interest. Our group is in favour of a specific directive on services of general economic interest because we fear that their inclusion in this directive may stand in the way of any new proposal by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objection concerns the compromise reached on Article 16, which does not increase the legal certainty of the text and in fact takes us back to the case law of the Court, as well as to the requirement for the Court to give a ruling on a case by case basis, contrary to the wishes of the Commission and of Parliament. The ball is now in the court of the Council, to whom it falls to define its common position. In this respect, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unanimously calls for the Council to amend and to improve this text, particularly in relation to the two points that I have just mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One must neither underestimate the points scored, otherwise one encourages defeatism, nor overestimate what seems to have been won, for fear of setting oneself up for disillusionment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the so-called ‘Bolkestein’ draft directive, where are we in this respect? The points scored at first reading in Parliament by the opponents of the original text are undeniable. The removal of the reference to the country of origin principle and the adjustment to the actual application of the Directive are the most symbolic setbacks imposed on the hard-liners of liberal Europe. The exclusion of a number of sectors from the scope of the Directive and the granting to the host country of supervisory powers, which are, nonetheless, limited, conditional and difficult to implement, are also significant factors. Finally, the exclusion of labour law takes us back to the law currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall examine the Commission’s new text under a microscope. If it appeared that the Commission was trying to reclaim part of the ground that it had had to concede, particularly by granting itself any automatic right of supervision, that would, in our opinion, constitute an unacceptable claim. If, on the other hand, it turned out that the Commission has included Parliament’s demands in its new revised draft directive, that would be both a fresh sign of the growing importance of our Assembly within the European institutional triangle and also, and perhaps most importantly, this would be the confirmation of the formative influence of the citizens’ sudden emergence in the European debate, especially since a certain 29 May 2005. That just shows you that our group has no intention of denying these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, however, does the result achieved to date manage to curb this craze for competition between workers, against which our fellow citizens are rising in ever-greater numbers? That is the real question, and our answer is ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the exceptions stated, the Directive in its amended form in fact reinforces rules establishing a form of integration that is no longer based on harmonisation of legislation, but on freedom of the market. The present circumstances and the weight of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in this respect merit our renewed attention, especially at a time of the enlargement of the European Union to include countries whose social standards are attractive to economic and political leaders obsessed with lowering costs and lifting ‘barriers to competition’ in the notorious free market economy in which competition is open and undistorted.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we prepared to depart from this repressive logic? When the time comes for the great open debate on the future of the European Union, that is the central issue on which I propose opening up the discussion, particularly on the left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amended text of the directive on services lacks precision and its wording is frequently unclear. Countries opposed to a free market in services are bound to take advantage of these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner McCreevy, at a meeting of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection two weeks ago, you stated that the excellent must not be allowed to stand in the way of the good. That is certainly true, but do you really believe that this draft, which represents the outcome of two years’ work on the liberalisation of the market in services within the European Union, is actually good? Do you consider that the directive as it stands is an appropriate response to the expectations of the European economy at a time when global competition is becoming ever more intense?</p>
<p class="contents">I find it hard to understand the stance adopted by the governments of certain Member States of the old Fifteen. They are pursuing a short-sighted and selfish policy, and are hindering competition within the European Union. As to the inaction and peculiar apathy demonstrated by the European Commission, I simply cannot come to terms with that at all. The Commission is supposed to be governed first and foremost by the interests of the European Union as a whole. It is supposed to strive to achieve at least the aims enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Two months ago the European Parliament turned the draft directive upside down, as Mrs Gebhardt so aptly put it at the time. This was the result of a most unfortunate compromise between the two largest political groups in the House. Nonetheless, the Commission did then assure advocates of a free market in services that alternative arrangements would be made to compensate for the removal of liberal provisions from the draft. I refer in particular to Article 24 and Article 25, which were intended to eliminate the barriers currently encountered by posted workers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now clear that the European Commission has failed to honour this promise. To all intents and purposes, the document it has prepared on posting workers is simply a description of the barriers now in place. It does not contain proposals for sanctions of any kind against countries blocking posted workers. It is, however, incumbent on the Commission to make radical changes to its policy towards countries that are blatantly infringing Community law on the freedom to provide services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to wish you every success in creating a free market within the European Union, Commissioners. Success in this endeavour is crucial for you and for the Union as a whole, but it calls for greater courage and determination on the part of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For once we are in the majority, and we shall make the most of it. We largely helped to take out the most questionable aspects of the Services Directive, starting with the notorious country of origin principle. Nonetheless, a number of grey areas remain, particularly in relation to services of general economic interest, and it will be up to the Council to resolve them, in agreement with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, the danger is elsewhere. The Commission intends to revise, and make more liberal, the directive on the posting of workers, which could partially invalidate the European Parliament’s legislative function.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we condemn in the strongest terms the Commission’s decision to reprimand France on the grounds that it adopted decrees against hostile takeover bids in 11 sensitive and strategic sectors, particularly in relation to defence. The Commission prefers to go against its own camp rather than to defend Europe’s interests at the WTO or in world markets.

He said that if we produced a balanced proposal with a strong majority from this Parliament, then the Commission would take that up and produce it as an amended text. And he has largely done that, as many colleagues have said. I am fully in support of that. It was a compromise. I make no bones about the fact that I would have liked to have seen a more liberal directive, but the fact remains that what is on the table is a major step forward in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner McCreevy, the point I want to make to you is will you please from now on become the strongest advocate of this directive. We want you to go out there and sell the package. You did not say in your speech that this directive contains a hundred separate measures directed at Member States to remove barriers to service businesses, to reduce bureaucracy, to simplify administration and to give more information. My colleague from Poland seems to have ignored that entirely in what he said just now.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have as a central clause freedom to provide services, proposed by this side of the House. I am absolutely convinced, and I am sure you will confirm it, that the formulation fully respects – and I use the word from the directive – the rules under which service providers operate in their own Member State. That is a major step forward, but we need you to go out there and advocate it in a strong and positive way. Please take that as the first message, because we need to win the hearts and minds of the people out there, who think that we produced a diluted and weak piece of legislation. If you read it, it certainly is not.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla very much, because we asked for a statement on the posting of workers directive as part of the compromise for removing Articles 24 and 25 of the proposal, and he has given us that. I think it could go further, but I am delighted that the two are linked together, which was a key demand from this side of the House.</p>

I have to say, Commissioner, that the rather limited definition of social services gives me some cause for concern, and I would like Parliament and the Council to spend some time thinking of a better definition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted, though, that the Commission has adopted Parliament’s social clauses with regard to respecting labour and social security legislation and the collective bargaining agreements and also, Commissioner, that the services directive gives priority to the posting of workers directive and respects this fully. I have to tell Commissioner Špidla, though, that I am not entirely happy with the content of the communication on the posting of workers, and so I would insist on this communication being presented to the social partners and Parliament for consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is a good thing that the red tape and restrictions which Member States impose and which have been repeatedly condemned by the Court of Justice will be eliminated, I get the feeling that the prohibitive clauses in the communication go much further than the administration of justice. For example, the opinion that the appointment of a representative among posted workers should be sufficient is tantamount to denying the Scandinavian countries their negotiation tradition. In addition, with the ban on previous permissions or registrations, you run the risk of undermining the system of licences, for example in the context of temporary employment. This will therefore need to be examined more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to give credit, though, for the good start that has been made on improving inspections in practice. It is vital that companies and employees should be better informed than they have been to date about the conditions of employment in relation to the posting of workers and that liaison offices become more effective. I also unreservedly endorse the idea of better equipping labour inspections and getting them to cooperate across the borders. This is something for which this House has repeatedly asked. Only then, I believe, will we have sufficient guarantees in place to create an internal market for services that function well while fully respecting the social ground rules.</p>

The Services Directive must not be allowed to impose limitations on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Posting of Workers Directive establishes the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, yet I have to tell Commissioner Špidla that I do wonder how, in view of the criminal energy expended on circumventing this principle in practice, one local foreman or one registration on the day work begins is meant to be enough to ensure that the Member States can keep tabs on what is going on. If the means of control available to the Member States are intended to help protect workers, then it follows that no restrictions must be placed upon them, and that – rather than the assertion that such a thing is no more than a bureaucratic imposition – must be the guiding principle of the handbook. The Posting of Workers Directive must continue to have the protection of workers as its primary purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have great admiration for the way in which you have met us halfway. What is now before us represents a big step forward. I have a few questions and comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with you, Commissioner McCreevy. You said that you will be presenting a document on health. What do you mean? Is it a directive? Indeed, we cannot accept a situation where the European Court of Justice decides that we should monitor the situation closely, only for nothing to be done thereafter. I would appreciate it greatly if it was a directive that were to be tabled, because you have not mentioned the form that document would take.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Commissioner Špidla, I agree with you both that Articles 24 and 25, as they were formulated originally, were included with the aim of making it impossible to put up administrative hurdles in the recipient Member State. I totally agree that something should be done about them. Having said that, wages and working conditions can also be skirted, which leads to improper competition on the labour market. That means, therefore that it is important for new policy guidelines to be drafted, also for the workers who are posted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question, though. Why have you issued a communication, Commissioner Špidla? I am asking you, because Mrs Schröder is writing a report on the posting of workers directive and you already have an assessment of the same directive at your disposal. Why have you issued a document that is difficult to enforce? Why did you not decide to adapt legislation instead?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have one last comment to make. I am delighted with the fact that the monitoring procedure that checks the way we deal with each other is set to improve thanks to different labour inspections joining forces. We will need to have another talk about how we could reinforce this procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group wishes the former Commissioner, Mr Bolkestein, a very happy retirement. Indeed, we hope that he will have a peaceful retirement, but his directive is well and truly dead. Henceforth, we shall have a Gebhardt – McCreevy directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still, of course, the Bolkestein orphans. On the extreme left and among certain well-known anti-Europeans, the Bolkestein Directive had become an obvious bogeyman, the symbol of an anti-social Europe. These people have difficulty in accepting that the Bolkestein Directive is definitively dead and buried. Others have the same problem, notably some enthusiasts of ultraliberalism, and here I am thinking of those who saw in the Commission’s original proposal a sort of master key providing access to a totally deregulated Europe. I am thinking in particular of that French baron who tries to look modern by speaking American when he is speaking on behalf of big employers.</p>
<p class="contents">Happily, though, the European Parliament has done its job, and a qualified majority of Parliament has rewritten the text that was submitted at first reading on the Commission’s original proposal in order to make it a respectable instrument that encourages the free provision of services, while avoiding any form of social dumping. The Commission has done well to broadly support the European Parliament’s position, even if we did observe a bit of shillyshallying last week. President Barroso has taken his troops in hand. We shall, of course, have to remain vigilant and we shall have to request some further information. Nonetheless, the Austrian Presidency would likewise do well to ensure that the Council supports Parliament so that we may quickly arrive at the proper Services Directive that we hope and pray for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are huge problems with applying the rules in practice. People are unaware of their rights, companies do not know which rules they have to follow and public authorities interpret the directive differently from one another. Rather than amend the directive, we therefore have a great deal to do in terms of better administration and the better provision of information. The EU and the Member States must together ensure that it is possible, for example via the Internet and quick caches, to obtain better information. In that way we should be able seriously to reap the benefits of an internal market for services. I am looking forward to the Commission taking initiatives in this area and ensuring that the Posting of Workers Directive operates better in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They certainly represent a further significant step towards the liberalisation of services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s document outlines the administrative barriers illegally imposed on firms posting their workers abroad for work purposes. It also contains examples of rulings by the European Court of Justice, which considers that such practices infringe the Treaty. Unfortunately, however, the document does not propose any effective ways of resolving the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has demonstrated quite clearly that it lacks the will to ensure compliance with Community law. Mere references to rulings by the Court of Justice are not enough. The barriers remain firmly in place in spite of the rulings, the Treaty and the Directive. Nothing has changed. More determined action is therefore called for, such as starting legal proceedings against those who have infringed the provisions. I fear that the proposal to prepare another report on progress achieved in eliminating barriers in a year’s time simply amounts to a further postponement of such action.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say how taken aback many Members of this House were on discovering that health services had been completely written out of the Commission’s opinion on the directive on services, even though the parliamentary vote showed a majority in favour of their inclusion.</p>

I shall reply to some of the specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the excluded sectors, it is important that we all remember that the provisions of the Treaty continue to apply to those services outside the scope of the directive. The College of Commissioners will debate the question of health within the next couple of weeks and the scope of the initiative will be decided at that time. Mr Kyprianou will have the lead and Mr Špidla and myself will be submitting our ideas to him. While I cannot be more specific today, I can say that at a minimum it will cover the issue of patient mobility and reimbursement for health expenditure. We will have to wait to see what Mr Kyprianou will bring forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour is being a little pessimistic about the reception given to this revised proposal. It is true that there has been a degree of negative comment in some of the media, but views will change with time and when people have had more time to digest what was voted on by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have vigorously sold the modified proposal to the Council of Ministers. At a meeting of the Council of Ministers on Sunday, 12 March 2006, I vigorously defended the intended revised proposal. I told the ministers that I intended to follow what the European Parliament had agreed in the main areas. While some ministers may have been somewhat sceptical initially, at the end of the meeting most were quite pleased as to what the outcome was going to be. The fact that the European Council last week overwhelmingly endorsed the vote in Parliament shows that the debate has moved on considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good proposal. Mr Harbour outlines many of the initiatives and the good points in it and we should be prepared to sell it as a very important step in the services area and as a good day for Europe when this particular directive is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said in committee meetings – and recently I attended a meeting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection – it is important to realise that the previous Commission’s proposal was never going to see the light of day as it was drafted. So those who defended the original proposals would have to recognise the political reality: it was never going to become a piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I as Commissioner and the College of Commissioners recognised was the political reality that we could not keep trumpeting how brilliant the proposal was while knowing in our hearts that it was going to remain on the shelf. We adopted the pragmatic approach of saying that we could see whether we could get a broad agreement among the Members of the European Parliament from the major groups because, if we could succeed in doing that, we would have a better chance of seeing the revised proposal through the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meetings of the Council of Ministers that I attended there were as many divisions as there were in the European Parliament. So I think Parliament has clearly shown the way. Now that we have a revised proposal, we all should be prepared to sell it and to recognise that it is a major step forward. Some might describe it as an incremental step forward, but a major step forward it is. It will be of considerable benefit to the economy of Europe, because what is at issue here is galvanising the European economy to be able to sustain the kind of growth rates that would deliver the number of jobs that are so necessary. In my opinion the modified services proposal will do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the broad consensus that has been reached on the most difficult points in this proposal, I am certain that the Council of Ministers will want to work closely with the European Parliament to try to reach an early agreement. We in the Commission will do all we can to facilitate an early final agreement on the text. If everybody maintains an open and constructive approach, we can steer this important proposal to a successful conclusion.</p>

Allow me to touch on some of the points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">In the continuing debate between the social partners and representatives of the Member States, and especially also within the framework of parliamentary debates, the view has now taken hold that the Directive is fit for purpose and that there is no pressing reason for it to be subjected to any fundamental legislative reworking, although its practical application may give rise to a number of problems. In the course of discussing the Services Directive, Parliament obtained a promise that the Commission would include in its communication a round-up of practice to date and of the decisions to date from the Luxembourg court. It is absolutely clear, and I think it applies across the entire legal system, that laws should be used only in accordance with the purposes for which lawmakers have framed them. The Posted Workers Directive should protect workers who have been posted, securing for them the appropriate rights while preventing social dumping, protecting them from exploitation and saving them from being forced into accepting unreasonable social standards and thereby competing unfairly against workers in the host country. This is the purpose of the Directive and this was our determining viewpoint when formulating a strategy for the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not of course the aim of the Directive to create artificial barriers, and this means that every single barrier and every administrative procedure must be weighed up from the following standpoint: is it necessary and essential to the greater protection of workers? If the answer is yes, then it will be in agreement with the Directive, if the answer is no, then it will not be. I can provide a typical example: the protection of workers unquestionably requires the use of official documents, but we can easily imagine that some documents may be unnecessary from this standpoint. This is one of the issues addressed in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">In a number of speeches a question also arose that was not connected directly with the communication, but was connected with the further development of the Services Directive and with issues relating to services in general. This was the question of social services in the public interest. I can report that the communication is already complete in respect of the fundamentals of this issue, and we expect it to be fully formulated by the end of April. The communication will, on the one hand, clarify some of the principal legal questions, because it is necessary to have precise and reliable interpretations of court decisions, and on the other hand it will put forward a number of other procedures that might be adopted with the further development and elaboration of the political concept of services in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Services Directive and the related communication, along with the additional negotiations and subsequent steps, provide an example of exceptionally productive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, within the framework of some highly demanding parts of our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might be allowed one more comment, already touched on by my colleague Mr McCreevy, which is that we do indeed expect some new legislative proposals to be formulated in relation to health care, and particularly in relation to the movement of patients within the health system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sorry that certain social services are still excluded from the directive: services like affordable housing and support for children and families must not be subject to the laws of competition, but must aim solely at meeting the beneficiaries’ interests. I hope, therefore, that these demands will be adequately taken into account in the social services directive that the Commission has announced for the end of April.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the country-of-origin principle has been removed and that the new document on the posting of workers has been drawn up. I think, in fact, that we need to guard against social dumping by carefully examining the rules of the market, especially as regards wages and working conditions. It is important to ensure that competition improves job quality for the benefit of workers and consumers. The ultimate aim of the European Union is in fact not to increase the volume of business but to create a competitive society that serves its citizens, a society that helps to raise the living standards of its members in every respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
