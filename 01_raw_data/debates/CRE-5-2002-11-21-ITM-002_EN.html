<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, in the short time available, there being two reports to be discussed, I will try to consider a number of different issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Herzog and Mr Lipietz, for their excellent reports. Once again, they both reflect Parliament’s overall support for European competition policy, support which is so important for the Commission and its departments.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to set out the main features of our competition policy in the state aid sector. The Commission has continued its efforts in this sector in order to simplify, modernise and clarify the rules and practices. New regulations and Community guidelines have been drawn up. For example, at the start of this year, new multisectoral regulations were adopted setting out a much clearer body of rules for the assessment of regional state aid for major investment projects. Another important example is the use of block exemptions, which allow Member States to grant aid without the need for prior notification. Block exemptions for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for training have been adopted and, recently, an exemption for state aid for employment too.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reduction and adjustment of state aid, the Member States undertook to reduce the level of aid in the Conclusions of the Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils. In effect, we have seen a clear downward trend, but undeniably, the cumulative effect of aid totalling EUR 82 billion is continuing to substantially distort competition in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now, if I may, respond to some of the points raised in Mr Herzog’s report. I firmly believe that the best way to promote overall Community industrial competitiveness is precisely to maintain a firm policy on state aid. state aid policy is criticised at times, in that it is said to be at variance with measures seeking to attain certain Community objectives. In my view, this variance is, in the majority of cases, more imagined than real. The aim of state aid control is to ensure that the positive effects of one particular measure are not counteracted by the distortion in competition which the measure itself creates.</p>
<p class="contents">I also endorse the view, expounded in the report, that we need to focus more on assessing the effectiveness and efficacy of aid. This is one aspect of the aid policy for which the Member States are chiefly responsible. They must develop ways to assess aid schemes, whereas the Commission, for its part, intends to help this process by providing a forum where experiences can be shared.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards competition law, our activities have been characterised by our debate on the Commission proposal to update its procedural rules. Work being carried out by the Council regarding the Commission proposal – a proposal fully supported by Parliament, which once again, I would thank – is now nearing completion. It is expected that the Council will agree on the text of a new regulation next week. I am sure that we will also see considerable improvements in our procedures with regard to the aspect which Parliament emphasised most in its resolution, that is the fact that European competition rules should be applied in all cases where trade between Member States could be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Updating Regulation 17, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of the permanent culture of reform which the Commission is seeking to encourage within the institution and which – as we shall soon see – also applies to mergers. I would like to point out, moreover, that as regards updating competition rules, it was the Commission, three years ago, which took the initiative. You will also recall that it was not all that easy, at the start, to persuade the Member States that it would be in the interest of better European governance to have more decentralisation in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards mergers, the number and complexity of cases which reach second phase investigations has increased rapidly. In 2001, the Commission issued five prohibition decisions. Even though this is the highest number of prohibition decisions issued in a single year, this figure continues to represent only around 1.5% of all final decisions. In this connection, it probably will not have escaped your attention that, in October, the Court of First Instance overturned two of these prohibition decisions, in the Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel cases, and there was also the judgment in the Airtours/First Choice case, already referred to in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">A detailed discussion on the consequences of these judgments for the Commission’s work would take more time than we have today. I would, however, like to make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are carefully considering the judgments, both in order to decide whether to appeal to the Court of Justice, and in order to take appropriate action for the future. Nevertheless, we should not allow these specific, individual cases to distort our view of the Community merger control policy. As you know, we initiated a vast reform of merger control procedures a long time before these recent rulings. If necessary, it may be appropriate to take advantage of the lessons we have learnt from these judgments in order to put into effect an even more radical reform than that originally planned: this is precisely my intention, as I have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of whether or not we appeal to the Court of Justice, it is right and proper that the Commission learns as many lessons as possible from certain assessments which have been made and, accordingly, the reform will be even more far-reaching and sweeping. I am, however, keen to specify, quite clearly, that the improvements which we expect to see in the instrument will in no way mean a more lenient policy. We believe that merger control policy – just like competition policy in general – must be fair but, at the same time, strict.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to propose to the College a sweeping reform of the merger control system by the end of December, and I would like to briefly highlight some of its aspects now. The first point concerns the length of investigations. A major advantage of the European system is the short investigation times, as is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, these short time frames also create some drawbacks which translate, as it were, into a certain tension, at times quite charged, in the final dealings between the parties and the Commission. Therefore, we will not relinquish the benefits derived from these short investigations – which exist in Europe but not in the United States – but we will also propose the introduction of a certain amount of flexibility through a series of provisions to extend certain deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The other improvements to the decision-making process which I plan to propose include: the formalisation and extension of the existing system of cross-checks in all cases which reach second phase investigations; greater transparency, allowing access to the dossier and dialogue between opposing market views at an earlier stage than is currently the case; more human resources in the Competition Directorate-General, both in order to work in a more appropriate fashion with regard to the high standards set by the Court and to improve our economic analysis capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch briefly on judicial control in the event of company mergers, which I am aware is of great interest to the European Parliament in general and to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent judgments have shown that the European courts exert strict, meticulous control over the Commission’s analyses in merger cases. Judicial control, which exists and is strict, should not, however, only be effective in terms of thoroughness, but also in terms of speed. In this respect, there is still substantial room for improvement, in terms of the speed with which judgments are issued. A fast track system has already been introduced, and we sincerely hope that the Court of First Instance will be able to deal more swiftly with and increase the number of fast track cases. The Commission is willing – as we have already stated – firmly to support the granting of further resources which the Court will certainly need to implement these improvements. Furthermore, it may be helpful to consider whether it would be appropriate to have judicial panels<span class="italic"> </span>of<span class="italic"> </span>experts handling certain categories of cases at first instance or a unit specialised in mergers at the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever kind of reform is considered in order to achieve a successful system, it is, in any case, important not to lose sight of the many merits of our administrative system. I must say that, following the publication of the Commission Green Paper, there were very few calls to abandon or make radical changes to the current system.</p>
<p class="contents">If forced to choose between our system and the US system, many businesses – several of which are American – have indicated a preference for the European Union’s system during consultations. Moreover, as you know, systems grounded on administrative decisions in this field are certainly not exclusive to the Commission. Indeed, this is the model used at national level, in the majority of Member States, and it reflects European legal traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposals will therefore significantly improve the current system: in some fundamental aspects, they will completely transform the present system. My ambition is that what we propose will be the most modern and effective merger control system, and it will improve the European model by incorporating certain aspects of the US model.</p>
<p class="contents">As time is short, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not expand on other important points addressed in the two reports by Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog. In particular, I am unable to consider one point which I know, however, to be of great interest to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, and that is international cooperation, an area in which considerable progress has been made over the last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jonckheer (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, please excuse the absence of my colleague Mr Lipietz, who has had to stay in Paris this week because a loved one is very ill. Our committee was not, in actual fact, unanimous on the report I am about to present to you on his behalf, in contrast with its unanimity on the report on the European Investment Bank. That is why around 40 amendments, including, moreover, a dozen or so tabled by my own group, have been tabled for discussion in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the differences of opinion that are quite traditional within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this type of report, I shall emphasise the points on which we agree, first of all highlighting our warm support for the work carried out by Commissioner Monti and his staff. Everyone in our committee is in favour of a well-organised European competition policy and the Commission’s report for 2001 bears witness to the efforts that you and your staff have made. International action, to which you have just referred, does not present any more of a problem. We are in favour of establishing global rules. The report therefore emphasises the need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of competition. The majority, if not all of our colleagues are opposed to renationalising competition policy, and this is a strong political message.</p>
<p class="contents">You have just referred to the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of our report clearly state: ‘the European Parliament does not consider the recent judgment of the Court of Justice (…) as disqualifying the work of the Commission’. The issue we should be raising instead is the reorganisation of the Court of Justice. You mentioned various alternatives. The report describes the creation of a new legal chamber. I do not know what your opinion is on the problem of state aid, which is the subject of the report by Mr Herzog.</p>
<p class="contents">If I understand correctly, next year we shall have a single report on competition policy and state aid policy. I am delighted to hear it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of agreement of great political importance concerns the fact that state aid should, as laid down by the Treaty, focus on horizontal objectives. In committee, the disagreements tended to concern the way in which the objectives were defined and implemented. We have already discussed this with you at length. A great deal of progress remains to be made. I have just learnt of the conclusions of the Competition Council in this regard. We must work towards making the various actions of the Commission compatible and coherent with European policies. In this context, the opportunity for recourse to state aid in order to achieve these horizontal objectives should be reiterated.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one last point of agreement between Members: we need to strengthen the legislative role of the European Parliament in all aspects of competition policy. The report specifically calls – this work is naturally the responsibility of the Commission – for Parliament to have the right of codecision with regard to legislative procedures concerning competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Two points have caused a great deal of controversy and a number of amendments concerning them have been tabled in plenary. The first concerns our stance with regard to the candidate countries. There is a consensus within the committee that competition rules should be considered to apply without discrimination to all the Member States. The effective implementation of competition policy, however, has led to debate. Although we must be strict in combating corruption – and the Commission’s reports emphasise how serious these problems still are in many of the candidate countries – some of us would like to see a degree of flexibility in the assessment of this state aid, along the lines of the attitude of the European Union during German reunification, when it seems that we adopted a particular attitude towards the new, reunified Länder.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point of agreement between committee members is their favourable view of the liberalisation of several economic sectors. Some consider that the processes underway are generally balanced and satisfactory, while others believe that these liberalisation processes do not comply with all the objectives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in order to avoid having to speak again, I would like very briefly, on behalf of my group, to highlight the importance we give to a number of amendments we have tabled on our assessment of the examination of state aid in the candidate countries. Then there are our Amendments Nos 19 and 22 on services of general interest, both at international level – WTO negotiations – and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to hear from you. As you know, the Convention has already received a number of contributions on the subject of services of general interest. Others will follow and I believe it would be appropriate politically for the Commission, also, to communicate to the Convention a contribution on the way in which it envisages the relationship between competition policy and services of general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herzog (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have supported me and in particular those who share the view of this report, which I believe to be balanced and concerned with real situations. I note that the amendments tabled by Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen ruin that balance and in fact condemn any state aid in market activities. I therefore hope that these amendments will not be retained and that the balance achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be preserved in plenary. I worked together with the Directorate General for Competition, which very carefully manages state aid policy, and I am very pleased with how the dialogue progressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Like any competition policy, the policy on state aid is facing new challenges. Its prime objective remains to reduce all aid that distorts or could distort competition, but other objectives should also be taken into consideration: competitiveness and growth – the Lisbon objectives – and social cohesion, which involves support for struggling regions to catch up and develop. This is why the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils made the commitment not to reduce all aid, but aid in the sense of Article 87, in other words aid that creates unfair competition. They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives. All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly, but with discernment.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress in my report that the effectiveness of horizontal aid must be evaluated. For example, the legitimacy of aid for research, the environment, training and employment is clear, and increases in this aid are often desired. However, it is not always effective in terms of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, and we should therefore move forward with our recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be dangerous to ban any notion of sectoral aid, however. This aid could prove to be essential for strategic projects on which Europe is falling behind and the market is declining, but also for dealing with unfair competition on the global market, or to save production operations that are faced with very serious economic shocks. We are aware that the Commission has also itself opened the debate on the interaction of competition and industrial policy. The enlargement of the Union to the Central and Eastern European countries also poses difficult problems which must be dealt with fairly. If the private sector will not fund the modernisation of the steel industry in Poland and the Czech Republic, in a global context of excess capacity, should we nevertheless ask those countries to give up developing that sector? A re-examination of steel aid is essential. In the same way, while it is legitimate to aim to eliminate special tax arrangements and convert them into regional aid, it should not be forgotten that countries such as Ireland benefited a great deal from them until recently and that as the economic level of the Eastern regions concerned is particularly low, it will not be possible to create viable companies straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding services of general interest, a perspective of progress is emerging. The Council and the Commission are re-assessing their interest for the Community. In accordance with the wishes of Parliament, the Court of Justice recognises that financial compensation, in return for the obligations imposed, is not aid. We therefore want the Commission to speed up its discussions on this basis and to propose new tools soon in order to ensure free choice, resources for services of general interest, and competition, as well as to safeguard non profit-making activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we ask it to speed up the work on considering tax systems, described by the Primarolo group as encouraging unfair competition, in terms of state aid that should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the scoreboard is a step forward in achieving transparency and in the public debate, and we welcome this. However, the Commission is aware of the limits that we have highlighted. The comparability of data between Member States is not guaranteed, the effectiveness of aid has not been evaluated and a comparison between the Union and its major world competitors has not yet been provided. These are also areas to work on in the future, and in view of which, it would be desirable to increase the involvement of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole. Competition is essential for the viability and efficiency of the internal market. However, the European Union has a great deal of progress to make in terms of industrial and technological development. We should not move backwards in terms of competition policy, but we need to bring industrial and competition policies to the same level in the treaties and in practice, otherwise the Union will fall behind in terms of innovation, scale effects, networks and creation of companies. Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down, while we wish to speed it up. The process of mergers is only one aspect of the problem. We are aware that the general centralisation of powers within the DG poses a problem, but we do not want to swing towards the American model. In the reform under preparation, we would prefer a much more open, deliberative instruction procedure, which allows for reasonable timescales, while the decision would still be the responsibility of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The competition report is based solely on the accountability of the Commission. This means that our comments carry about as much weight in the Commission as Economic and Social Committee opinions, and no more; we must be clear about this. This is not to say, however, that the Commission, which has been given considerable competence here, wishes to restrict its rights in the field of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a number of critical comments about the further development of competition policy <span class="italic">per se</span>. Progressive globalisation, the fact that the European economy is characterised by mergers, and an ever tougher competition policy have consequences for the situation on the ground in that they bring changes for the labour market. This does not mean that I wish to bring this process to a halt; I want to put to you the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is that the employment guidelines are no longer sufficient on their own to compensate for the labour market problems arising from increased competitive pressure combined with today's weak growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that we should not, indeed we must not, pin excessive blame for current problems on competition policy; I am clear about that. But what I wish to say is that the possible extension of competition rules to services of general interest would appear to me to be problematic. It is not for the Commission to define these on its own; it must be done by politicians in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition policy is undoubtedly of value in itself, but must be reconciled with socially important areas of general interest, and this is even more important as the European Union prepares for enlargement. I hope that you will have sympathy for this view, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the abolition of the notification requirement for competition agreements. I think this is a positive development that will reduce the administrative burden on companies and the authorities. We would, however, urge the Commission to fulfil a justified desire on the part of companies to obtain more legal certainty, particularly in complex matters. We would ask the Commission to investigate whether it would be possible at all in exceptional cases, involving large investments, to make general statements about the compatibility of agreements with European competition rules, as is common in America with the Business Review Letter.</p>
<p class="contents">The modernisation of competition policy can only succeed if the competition rules are applied in a uniform and consistent manner across the EU. What we need is a European appeal option against decisions taken by national competition authorities. We would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps in this direction. As Mrs Peijs said a moment ago: trust is good, but control is better in cases like these.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the network of national competition authorities requires a clear and transparent statute. At the moment, it is still unclear how cooperation goes on, and there is no real statute for it. Such a statute should clearly set out how the Commission and national competition authorities should relate to each other and how mutual cooperation takes place, particularly, for example, in the exchange of confidential information. I think that very sound and clear agreements are needed in this respect and I also believe that the candidate countries should be involved in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we take the view that it would benefit the democratic legitimacy of economic competition legislation if Parliament, too, were to be given codecision rights in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of these aids concern industry, the energy sector, the transport sector or agriculture, which is why the Committee on Industry has issued an opinion on the Herzog report. In this opinion, which was adopted by a large majority, we firstly welcomed the State Aid Scoreboard, which provides greater transparency and openness and gives a clearer overview of the situation. Secondly, in conjunction with this, we adopted a series of demands in the Committee on Industry, which are addressed to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we welcome the objective of continuously reducing overall aid allocations. Secondly, we say that future scoreboards should include subsidies in the accession countries. Our third demand – and this is an old request – is for the thresholds applied to the 'de minimis' rule to be raised. In the future we want the smaller cases to be exempted so that local decision-makers have more room for manoeuvre. In addition, we want the special tax arrangements to be subjected to more intensive scrutiny and to be included in this Scoreboard. Finally, in particular where services of general interest are concerned – other Members have already commented on this – we want the Commission to at last get round to doing its job, as it has been saying it will for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a Green Paper on the provision of services of general interest is currently being prepared. We hope, Commissioner, that this Green Paper, which is of course being drafted primarily under the authority of the Commission President, will encompass all aspects of services of general interest. We do not think that in general these services should be exempt from the competition rules, as has just been said, but that where the picture is unclear, clarity can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final point in the Committee on Industry is a long-standing demand on the part of Parliament. It concerns the regulations on which you have just reported, Commissioner, and which will entail an update of Regulation No 17. We want these regulations – including the forthcoming rules on services of general interest – to be classified as internal market legislation and to be subject to the codecision procedure. I know that this is not in your interests, but it is in ours. Nevertheless, we hope for your understanding on at least some of these points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He very much regrets that he cannot be here today. We have presented some amendments to these reports, with the general aim that they should provide more encouragement for free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few years, the European Union has rightly focused on the need for greater competition and consumer choice and has often used its powers to great and beneficial effect. Increased free trade and the reduction of unfair subsidies have been a most positive result. Just as policies of this kind produced handsome rewards for businesses and consumers when my country, under a Conservative government, rediscovered and pioneered these practices in the 1980s, they are now doing the same in the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging greater competition is an enormous task. For the first three decades after the Second World War, state aid and protectionism were less controversial. It is still difficult to combat these traditional ideas and entrenched interests, especially in a climate where the opponents of free trade often have the catchier slogans.</p>
<p class="contents">We are most fortunate that we have, in Commissioner Monti, someone who is convinced that the opening of markets and the freeing of trade is in everyone's interest. We are most grateful to him for his persistent and hard work in combating anything, be it cartels or subsidies, that impedes the operation of a fair market.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Herzog concerns the newly-introduced scoreboard for state aid. This is a most useful tool. We fully support its introduction and are anxious that it should be used enthusiastically. It is most encouraging to note that it points to a decline in state aid, although we would like to see a further decrease. The disparities between countries show that some Member States provide up to three times as much state aid as others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our hope that the scoreboard will serve as an encouragement to Member States to continue and accelerate their reforms and that the scoreboard will also assist the reforms of the new Member States after their accession in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lipietz's report focuses on general competition policy and we are pleased to see that it reflects many of our concerns. In particular, the report highlights the lack of progress in the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets and urges action in the opening up of European markets in energy, transport and postal services. The report rightly congratulates Commissioner Monti and his staff on their approach. We in this Parliament should urge him further along the path he has chosen to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by commending the continuation of the European Union's policies in these areas to Parliament. I hope Parliament will support our amendments and I look forward to even greater progress in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not always the case however. The explanation can be found in the nature of Parliament and its Rules of Procedure. They do not lend themselves to discussion of long-term issues. After all, this is a political chamber, not an academic body or a group of experts. To take an example, here we are at the end of 2002 debating the content of a Commission report relating to 2001. Many significant events have taken place since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these constraints, any report by Parliament is unlikely to be a suitable document and provide an overview of the present state of the debate on European competition policy. I do not of course wish to imply any criticism of Mr Lipietz. He has done good work. What happens is that interplay between political majorities and minorities, a feature of chambers like ours, means that a whole range of elements tend to be added to resolutions such as the one before us today. Often these elements have little direct bearing on the main issue, which on this occasion is competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this is nothing new. I am sure Mr Lipietz would agree with me. When he appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs he regretted the introduction of many of the additional sections and the rejection of other potential ones. I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur. I believe that if the report were approved as it now stands, it would not prove to be a document offering useful insights or significant contributions to the current debate on competition, despite the rapporteur’s good work.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to Commissioner Monti’s statement today, you should all agree on these shortcomings. In Mr Monti’s view, there are several serious problems in the area of competition at present. These relate to modernisation, to reform of Regulation 17 dating from 1962, which we trust will be undertaken as a matter of urgency, and to the various difficulties arising from repeated jurisprudence on mergers at the Court of First Instance. I refer to the three rulings.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European competition policy and the Commission’s work in this field have been vital to the creation of the single market. Thanks to the introduction of the euro, it has become obvious that price differences between the Member States still exist. Allow me to suggest that we should today be considering whether competition policy needs to be strengthened, institutionally or in some other way, so as to overcome the last remaining barriers between us and the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">These, then, are some of the problems we should be tackling. It is unfortunate that we have failed to do so in the course of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On condition that these amendments are adopted, we shall vote in favour of the report. I would also thank the Commission for the work done on the scoreboard, which is a very useful tool for achieving the objective of a general reduction in state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report on the Commission’s 31st report on competition policy. I am especially pleased with the support given by the committee to my proposal that consideration should be given to setting up a competition court, Article 225 A of the Treaty of Nice having paved the way for such a possibility. A competition court would increase the legal protection of European enterprises. A competition court would have to operate as a counterweight to, and supervisor of, the Commission’s experts on issues relating to competition policy. It would ensure that the Commission was no longer viewed as the body that both investigates and judges enterprises. It would make for greater transparency of the enterprises concerned. I absolutely do not want to see a weakening of competition policy in general. On the contrary. Nor do I want to see the Competition Directorate-General’s role in competition policy weakened. I want to support Commissioner Monti and all the other forces for good in their view that, in the future too, competition policy should remain precisely that, with no interference from other policy areas, such as industrial policy. I am delighted that Mr Monti is well disposed towards a European competition court.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also take the liberty of looking forward and commenting on the Commission’s motion for a resolution for reforming EU competition law. Throughout the reform process, the ELDR Group has supported the Commission in stating that reform is necessary. At the same time, we have maintained that this must not lead to a renationalisation of competition policy. The Commission has assured us that this will not happen and has referred to a network’s being set up, consisting of the Competition Directorate-General and the national competition authorities. I am confident that this network would be effective. At the same time, I would, however, put forward a proposal that I hope the Commission will consider. It is about creating a special unit or task force in the Competition Directorate-General whose task it will be to ensure, and monitor the fact, that the competition rules are applied equally in all the Member States. This is a large and important task that will become still greater with the forthcoming enlargement. I shall go into this in more detail in a letter to the Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is necessary constantly to improve European rules in this field. Since, however, the European Union does not exist in isolation from world trade, a competition system is also needed in the WTO context.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to take seriously the task that we set ourselves at the Gothenburg Summit, following on from the Lisbon Summit, then competition policy must not only be limited to economic conditions, but must also take into account social and environmental factors. An economy cannot be competitive if it does not have a highly skilled workforce at its disposal, if wages and salaries are so low that competition does not bolster domestic demand but chokes it, and if manufactured products carry no guarantee that they are not harmful to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a change of thinking here, to transform the internal battle for subsidised locational advantages into a debate about how we can make the way people live more sustainable. Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities. It will not, however, be possible to achieve equality of opportunity if technical standards are insufficiently harmonised, if Member States' tax policies differ so greatly that it is impossible to compare the actual cost burdens, and if social standards in the Member States diverge widely.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not oppose state aid; I support it, provided that these aids have a binding legal basis that is the same for everybody and provided that they do not help to perpetuate the use of old, environmentally damaging techniques and technologies but instead promote investment for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In short – and this brings me back to where I started – competition policy is about creating an equilateral triangle around economic policy, social policy and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really destroy it, in that they delete at least ten articles and paragraphs from it. I am therefore surprised, as in a way it is the whole human aspect of this report that is deleted by those amendments. You are aware that the Treaty establishes that aid provided by Germany to regions of East Germany is in line with the single market. Our colleague quite rightly states that this aid could be allocated to regions of the candidate countries. But there is just deletion and more deletion, and given the extent to which the PPE-DE declared its support for the social market economy in Estoril, I must admit that I do not understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Football is such a sport, which can only exist by virtue of there being an opponent present. In a fair game, an opponent should have the same means available as the other party. This is, after all, about fair competition in which a battle can be fought for first place, but also for honour.</p>
<p class="contents">In professional football we have noticed, in the Netherlands for example, how a Commission measure on state aid triggers reactions. For example, I gleaned from a Dutch newspaper this week that our Socialist fellow MEP, Mr Max van den Berg, would like to exempt professional football clubs from European rules on state aid. However, in my view, this reaction overshoots the commercial goals pursued by professional clubs. Unlike Mr van den Berg, I would therefore express my support for the measures which the European Commission has taken to reverse, if possible, the aid granted to professional football.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the granting of state aid is, and continues to be, a measure which is explicitly temporary in nature. If aid is granted for a longer period of time, then competitiveness becomes distorted. An aid-based relationship of dependence between industry and government is an interference in the functioning of the market. I would also at the same time acknowledge the positive effect state aid has. After all, if thanks to a temporary measure, socially useful goals are achieved, temporary aid is quite justified. This is to give companies an incentive to achieve such goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should at this point like to draw your attention to the importance of granting aid in order to implement environmental legislation. It is a fact that industry is hit by high costs as a result of a plethora of new measures. If, as a result of environmental measures, Europe's competitiveness were to suffer compared to non-EU countries, I would deem it justified for costs to be borne by society to a limited extent and subject to clear conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the accession of the candidate countries, a new chapter should be added to competition policy and the question of state aid. A number of candidate countries provide foreign investors with favourable fiscal conditions. This is with a view to protecting local employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Mr Herzog's report expressly refer to the issue of aid to the steel industry in different accession countries. In this connection, I am of the view that Amendment No 16 concerns a change that leaves no room for doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call for the unambiguous and fair treatment of the candidate countries with regard to state aid and competition. I therefore endorse Amendments Nos 20 and 21 to the Lipietz report which clearly state that the accession countries are faced with problems that are different from those of the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However understandable state aid is from the standpoint of the candidate countries, this is, and always will be, a form of state aid that does not fit within the rules on state aid and competition. A clearly defined exemption position gives the new Member States the scope to improve healthy economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with a question to Commissioner Monti. Over the past couple of years, it has become clear that the accession countries have an economic structure that is different from that of the EU Member States. This structure and mentality change less quickly than we would like them to, so the accession countries require an approach customised to the needs of each of them. Application of the rules in full is a measure that does not do any justice to the development of a social market economy in the accession countries. How do you propose to find a fair solution to the problem of state aid in the accession countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not establish a system of prior approval for mergers. Therefore the creation of a dominant position following a merger does not have to be negotiated in advance with the Commission and such a dominant position is not in itself contrary to the Treaty. Once again the Commission, in order to maintain its importance, has taken on powers that it does not have, inventing entirely arbitrary, or worse, ridiculous criteria to serve its cause. An example of this is when it analyses market shares country by country and product by product, while taking advantage of the frivolity or even absence of the French authorities when it comes to safeguarding French industrial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, while the Treaty establishing the European Community in no way forbids the development of state companies, the Commission in Brussels hounds French public companies as symbols, which in its eyes are intolerable, of triumphant Colbert-style state intervention. In this respect, any attempt at forcing the French Government to privatise public sector companies will provoke a vigorous response from all employees or, and why not, a general strike across all sectors of industry. It is not only the services of the Directorate General for Competition that need to be reformed, but also Commissioner Monti, who knows nothing about industry, who should be disowned, and the Commission in Brussels needs to be put back in its place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the short time available to me, I will have to confine myself to state aid policy and therefore to Mr Herzog's report, which we Social-Democrats fully support.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me first to make a comment, Commissioner: do not be too disconcerted by what the previous speaker has just said. This really is far removed from what the vast majority of Members of this Parliament thinks. I believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, we endorse this report by Mr Herzog on state aid, which supports the strict policy of state aid control that is implemented by the Commission on the basis of the treaties. It is a balanced report, which points out that state aid policy also has to meet other EU objectives, in particular competitiveness, growth and employment, and this in accordance with the Lisbon strategy. That is why I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that there has again been a decline in state aid. This is the result of the Commission's tough aid control policy. Because not only do these aids carry a risk of distorting the market, but also aid must of course, in each instance, first be obtained from elsewhere and may then be lacking in another area.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can they be rejected wholesale, however. Instead qualitative criteria must be used to assess each grant of aid to ascertain whether the objective sought might not justify distortions to the market, which may be limited in time, or whether these measures might even eliminate existing distortions to the market in the medium term. In this context, Commissioner, I should like to recall two points, in connection with which I asked questions and made requests during a debate on the same subject all of a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the most competitive region, which is of course what we want to be, has to distinguish itself by having competitive companies. This means that the companies should manage as far as possible without aids and that any aids have to be directed at increasing the competitiveness of these companies. In the process, however, it is not only the individual company that needs to be assessed; the entire net product chain of which the company is part needs to be taken into account. If you wish to apply qualitative criteria it is not enough to focus solely on one single company.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns a request that I wish to make in the field of regional policy. Today we are already discussing how regional policy will actually work after 2006. Much will change for the present EU of 15, for the old Member States, and it is right that it should. But in this context we really do need to consider how we are going to rebalance regional aids across the Member States. We need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time. We might conclude that everything can stay the same, but we might also conclude that we need a new mechanism of some kind. Do not make us wait until the end; let us start this discussion now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, a competitive economy open to competition would bring tangible social benefits in the European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner thus concluded that we need an even more vigorous competition policy than that in the United States, and we should give him credit for having pursued it, even accepting the risk of making mistakes or in any case, making judgments different from those made by judicial bodies called upon in some cases to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to state aid, in particular, Europe is set to face an extremely important challenge over the next few years in the current negative economic climate. Efforts to recover state aid are being made alongside protectionism and state intervention in the economy: a perilous path to take. The Treaties wisely set strict limits on state aid and these limits must be preserved and confirmed, not least where governments seek to misuse or liberally distribute state aid, something they will increasingly seek to do.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other unresolved issues: former state monopolists – starting with EDF, Enel, France Télécom, Deutsche Telekom – state aid for broadcasting, state aid in the event of structural adjustments and, in this context, also state aid disguised as something else.</p>

<p class="contents">I really do think it is important for us to make competition policy more democratic and invest it with greater legitimacy than it has had so far, because after all the decisions that the European Union makes on the internal market, the market economy and competition are justified by the fact that competition has a distributive function and is therefore said to contribute to fair income distribution, increase social welfare and act as a mechanism to ensure that the factors of production are efficiently allocated. This should improve supply to the benefit of producers and consumers and finally it should also act as an incentive to promote technical progress and maximise the national product.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging. These considerations should also play a role in our debate about a constitution and in the revision of the treaties, and I very much hope that they will also be even more visible in the application and reform of competition law. Finally, this policy must also be brought into line with the Lisbon process and its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the annual report is certainly a successful report and it is also positive that for the first time it addresses the issues surrounding services of general interest. Unlike Mr Langen, I expect the Green Paper to provide not only a thorough analysis of how to handle the provision of public services of general interest, but also a decision on a starting point for future legislation. In this context, I welcome the fact that you wish to put the public service guarantee on the same footing as the principle of free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will produce a proposal for a framework regulation or framework directive as quickly as possible and that it will take account of national specificities and traditions and in particular leave it up to the Member States to define public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you were right to say how important it is to control cartels and mergers. I should like to stress once more here that there is certainly a need to analyse the individual parts of the latest court rulings in precise detail and to draw conclusions from them. But these court rulings do not in any way dent Parliament's confidence in the Commission's competence, which has been amply proven over the years. Commissioner, I should like to ask you to take greater account of workers' rights in your merger control work ...</p>

This policy has helped create huge monopolistic groups which have acquired a dominant position on the market by promoting mergers, alliances and takeovers and greater unaccountability when it comes to price fixing, thereby ousting competitors – mainly small and medium-sized enterprises – from the market, and has resulted in massive waves of redundancies, spiralling unemployment and loss of wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">The view that competition policy is the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to job creation has proven to be misguided, because exactly the opposite is happening in practice.

Competition policy is supposed to protect European consumers, lead to fair market prices, create increased supply and increase all market participants’ dynamism and capacity for innovation. Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies. It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market.</p>

We are on the right track because we are seeing a fall in the number of cases investigated and because there has been an increase in the fines imposed.

<p class="contents">We have not yet reached our goal because we have not completed our work in the interests of public welfare, because services of general interest do not yet have the clear exemptions and rules within competition law to make it possible to allow services of general interest and competition law to function harmoniously together. I also welcome the Commission's proposal to apply the 'de minimis' rules to all arrangements between SMEs and call on the candidate countries to implement the competition rules quickly so that there are no distortions of competition between different industrial locations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an enormous task, as Mr Purvis stressed. It is also very important to note, as Mr Junker did, that there is a fundamental consensus in favour of a vigorous competition policy involving international cooperation and against a renationalisation of European competition policy. I also note the willingness to keep the European Commission as the decision-making body, under the judicial review of the courts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>I wish to be very brief, as I must, Mr President, and begin by answering the most critical of all the interventions. I hope that Mr de Gaulle is still there to listen to what I have to say on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Gaulle, you said that there is no reason for having a policy to control mergers, because there is already Article 82, on the abuse of a dominant position. You are well aware that there is also a regulation on mergers, to prevent dominant positions from being created or reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment, on which I must entirely disagree with you: you accuse the Commission of at times analysing market shares on a national basis. You will perhaps recall that, even in the ruling that was very critical of the Commission in the Schneider/Legrand case, the Court did not contest that the relevant market was the national market.</p>
<p class="contents">The third comment, on a very important point, Mr de Gaulle: you say that the Commission hounds public companies. You should know that this is quite the opposite of the truth. I invite you to read, for example, even if it is only in the French press, what I said recently in an interview: our opportunities for intervention are limited by a principle, which I see as sacrosanct, which is the neutrality of the Union and its treaties with regard to the public or private property of companies. This is why I never allow it to be said in France, as you said today, Mr de Gaulle, that the capital of EDF or Gaz de France is being opened up because Brussels requires it. That is not true. Nevertheless, the Treaty requires public and private companies to comply with competition rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- Mr President, several Members have referred to the control of our state aid in candidate countries. I can certify that enormous efforts have been made, that some flexibility has been applied by the European Commission in terms of converting incompatible state aid into compatible state aid, and that although some remaining points of criticism remain, the situation is, by and large, satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, that whereas competition policy is indispensable, it would be all the better if the European Union were able to reinforce industrial policy and R&amp;D policy. We do not see any contradiction between these two elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is a little difficult to go deeper into this issue under these circumstances, I would like to repeat the favour with which the Commission sees the efforts by the courts in Luxembourg to speed up the judicial review. As I have already stated on several occasions, the Commission will be helpful concerning the possibilities of setting up judicial panels, for example, keeping the administrative decision within the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov and others underlined the need for a synergy between competition policy, social policy and ecology policy. We tried to achieve that. I will refer here to social policy and the recently-introduced framework for state aid to employment, and, in relation to the environment, to the recent guidelines on renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">My last remarks concern the full support given by Parliament to the modernisation of anti-trust rules. If I had time I would go through several points which could completely reassure Mr Doorn, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and others: there will not be renationalisation of competition policy through this reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Mrs Randzio-Plath, we work under the current institutional rules but I am most grateful for the constructive interaction we have developed between the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which you chair, and the European Commission. In that context the discussion of competition issues goes far beyond what the current institutional context requires.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise to all the MEPs for whom I have been unable, owing to time constraints, to provide articulate answers.</p>
