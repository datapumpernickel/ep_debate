<p class="contents">It was difficult to explain that this process was blocked because of Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon, on delegated acts. This was something about which those refugees, some of the most vulnerable people in the world, clearly neither knew nor needed to know. However, there have been several attempts to resolve this issue. There was a proposal by the Hungarian Presidency in May, to which we responded with a counterproposal by Parliament itself in June, and we have been waiting until now for a response from the Council which at long last concludes the codecision that we initiated one and a half years ago, and which, among other things, enables an increase in the funding available to the Member States’ for making voluntary resettlements. It is important to add the word ‘voluntary’ here, as it is the Member States that decide to begin their processes of resettling refugees and decide on the numbers to be resettled by this process, so they do not have to fear any kind of imposition from the Commission or Parliament. All that is needed is for the Council to conclude the codecision on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, people have already died, which we would have been able to address when emergency situations broke out in the Mediterranean had the codecision been adopted, along with its emergency mechanism for resettling refugees. Today, the only good news is that we have saved that part of the codecision by adopting it through a pilot project of this very Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, therefore, did its homework a year and a half ago, and continues to work ceaselessly on behalf of refugees, who are the most vulnerable people on the planet and whose numbers are relatively small.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by asking the Council three very specific things: firstly, what does the Council think of the counterproposal made by Parliament in June? Secondly, how does the Council intend to go about concluding this codecision? Thirdly, I would like to ask whether the Council is willing to fast-track negotiations in conjunction with Parliament and the Commission in order to close this file by the end of the Polish Presidency. If not, we will lose not one or two months, but two whole years of resettling refugees, with all the suffering that this entails for the people waiting and despairing in the refugee camps, who may run the risk of fuelling human trafficking networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to this important subject of a resettlement programme, we have achieved agreement across all of the groups. Many of the Member States are already implementing resettlement programmes. In other words, there is broad consensus that this is necessary and, above all, that it is not only an urgent, but also a highly volatile situation – as demonstrated in particular by the current situation in Africa. Thus, it is actually absurd that, even though there is agreement from almost all sides, this can founder simply as a result of the technical implementation. It is the duty of both the European Parliament – we are aware of this and that is why we have tabled a proposal – and the Council to assume responsibility here and to push this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I have experienced the Polish Presidency to be very creative, also in connection with the asylum package. It has tabled new proposals. For that reason, I am really placing my hope in the fact that you will now see the opportunity and present us with a proposal that is workable for the Council, the Commission and for us as Parliament, and that now, as we are in any case all in agreement, we can finally also tackle the implementation and – as Mr Tavares also said – can finally bridge that period that costs some people their lives.

We debated it a few months ago, when we re-addressed this issue in debates on the asylum package, and we all agreed that the refugee resettlement programme links in directly with the overall asylum package that we need to complete by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">However, whereas we all have the same intention, we ultimately disagree on who will make the decision and how. Of course, this disagreement, while this debate continues and we make no progress, is being interpreted as political inadequacy.</p>
<p class="contents">If you think that 84 000 of our fellow men have applied for resettlement and we have only managed to process 6 800 of those applications, then you will understand the magnitude of the problem. Resettlement – as we have to explain every time – is not simply a facility, as we have discussed in the past, that Europe must have in order to demonstrate its solidarity with third countries and in order for us to show respect for those of our fellow men in difficulty. Resettlement means rescuing a person when we cannot protect them in their present situation. That is what resettlement means, especially in these difficult times, with the massive upheavals in the Arab world. Of course, we understand that the Council too has its position, but the delay and constant procrastination are, unfortunately, not helping.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by saying that it should be self-evident to all of us – we too, here in Parliament, as we have stressed time and again, are willing to take our share of the responsibility – that we should use the EUR 628 million in the Refugee Fund. That the Treaty of Lisbon needs to be applied in connection with the interinstitutional <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> should also be self-evident. It should also be self-evident, from the point of view of perception and approach, that Europe has no more room for disagreement, be it on the economy today or on immigration tomorrow; we have resettlement, we have the asylum package. We must, without further delay, all join together and make the maximum possible use of every facility available to us at Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council’s position has still not been made clear to us, because it has done nothing over the long period of time since the agreement was brokered at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know full well, the Member States can already benefit from the European Refugee Fund. In order to encourage the Member States to resettle refugees – because, generally speaking, there are very low resettlement rates at global level – the Member States of the European Union receive EUR 4 000 per refugee.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement we brokered together simply upgrades the current practice, by making provision for greater economic aid: EUR 6 000 instead of 4 000 for Member States which have never resettled refugees, so that they can develop suitable infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this will create a win-win situation – in fact nearly everyone stands to gain something – I truly do not understand why the agreement has been blocked in the Council for so long and why the Member States have not done anything.</p>

We would like to remind everyone that the present European Refugee Fund for 2008-2013 does identify the question of resettlement as a desirable measure. Furthermore, since 2008 a significant amount has been allocated from the European Refugee Fund to this purpose. Under the present rules, Member States are entitled to apply for the sum of EUR 4 000 for each resettled person falling into one of the categories set out in the appropriate decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the proposed amendments to the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund for 2008-2013 is to create the possibility to establish common Union annual priorities for resettlement. This would mean that action taken on resettlement at Union level would be better coordinated and focussed. Also important is the fact that annual priorities would contain certain specified categories, some of which are mentioned in the current decision on the European Refugee Fund. For example, one of the categories qualifying for financial support from the European Refugee Fund is persons from a country or region designated for the implementation of a Regional Protection Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regional Protection Programme was established in April 2010. It includes persons resettled from North Africa who qualify for grants from the current Refugee Fund. The same applies to particularly vulnerable groups, such as children and women at risk, and also to persons with serious medical needs. Seven Member States: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden have offered the Bureau of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 408 places to resettle persons from North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that participation in resettlement work is voluntary, the European Parliament has suggested the adoption of further incentives to involve a greater number of Member States by increasing the levels of the grants available. The proposal being made is for the provision of EUR 6 000 for each resettled person for a Member State which uses the Fund for resettlement purposes for the first time, and EUR 5 000 for each resettled person for a Member State which has already used the Fund in the past. The Council would be able to support these plans. However, the Council cannot support the suggestion of the European Parliament on application of the procedure of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to adopt common Union annual priorities for resettlement. The Council’s position is based on explanations provided by the European Commission relating to the time frames imposed by the programming period in connection with operation of the General Programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. The Council shares the view of the Commission that establishing annual priorities for resettlement is a purely executive function, because it concerns the application of detailed principles specified in a decision concerning a specific situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is trying to find a way to resolve this issue, and this includes consideration of the alternative approach put forward in May of this year, thanks to which it would be possible to avoid the necessity of using delegated acts. Nevertheless, the Polish Presidency does regret that it has so far not been possible to find a mutually acceptable solution to this particular question and that as a result of this situation it has not yet been possible to adopt the decision in question in full. Considering that measures related to resettlements can be financed from the current Refugee Fund and taking into account the fact that there is now only one annual period left in the present programme, the Polish Presidency thinks it would be better to continue the discussion on establishing a joint EU resettlement programme in the context of the next programming period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very frustrating to be discussing formalities when the most vulnerable people in the world are waiting for us to make a decision. We need to find procedures to overcome this so that we can put the programme in place as soon as possible. I know that the Polish Presidency, like the Hungarian Presidency, tried to find a compromise, but it did not gather sufficient support.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the informal counter-proposal put by the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. The problem is that it raises some important legal and institutional concerns, most specifically regarding the establishment of a procedure outside the Treaty which would nonetheless legally bind the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Refugee Fund is a complex fund with well-defined rules; some would say too well-defined. Pledging of resettlement must take place every year in June. As the Resettlement Fund only runs until 2013, next year’s pledging exercise will be the last in his current fund. It will therefore be the last chance for us to establish annual EU resettlement priorities under the present rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Any amendment to the fund decision must be finalised in the coming month to ensure that pledging by Member States could take place next spring under the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committed to making every effort to work with the Council, the co-legislators, the rapporteur and Parliament to try to finalise a compromise that could establish an EU joint resettlement programme under the present financial perspective. But such a compromise must respect the rules and the procedures in the Treaty, must ensure the smooth functioning of the Fund and must be acceptable to all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are working hard and we are willing to work even harder to find a flexible way to fund EU resettlement in the future. This is an increasingly important issue, and we hope that increased funding, combined with new more flexible rules in the future, will result in more resettlement in the EU Member States, which would express our solidarity with the most vulnerable people in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is that we should analyse properly the counter-proposal by the rapporteur, because I think what Mr Tavares is trying to do is get some movement here on something which is frustrating colleagues right across the political spectrum, as we heard in the speeches by the authors of the oral question. Secondly, you said that we need to have future financing and a stable position for future resettlement so that we do not keep coming back with oral questions in this frustrating way.</p>
<p class="contents">For our group it is very simple: if we do not find a solution before the end of 2011, we jeopardise the planned use of the European Refugee Fund, which lapses in 2013. Secondly, Member States will not receive the extra funds allocated by the European Refugee Fund; and thirdly, of course, the emergency mechanism provided for in this codecision, which we could have used in the context of the Arab Spring, will continue to remain inoperative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very clear that there is agreement that, while we spend many hours in this Parliament and in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs talking about common asylum policies, resettlement is a way of managing, in a very coordinated and sometimes symbolic way, the pressures that we now see in the Mediterranean. For this reason, we can contrast – as other speakers have said – the way that we operate our resettlement programme (with fairly small numbers and some inaction from the Council) with what has happened with the US and Canada, for example, where so many more thousands of refugees have been resettled in a coordinated way.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the EU better to respond to such situations, the European Parliament adopted this codecision report on the European Refugee Fund as far back as May 2010. As the Commissioner has just said, it is deeply frustrating that we are constantly coming back to this Parliament to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore wanted this debate today because we need answers. Parliament has put proposals on the table aimed at finding a solution to the delegated acts issue, but this has met with silence from the Council. This is obviously unacceptable, and we fully expect the Council to inform us of its position on delegated acts in a way that is credible, and on all the positive aspects of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The pressure on the Council must be maintained. We are frustrated in Parliament across the parties, and I think we will continue to push this issue, because it is a managed and humane way of dealing with some of the consequences of the Arab Spring. In future we will have crises on which we want a stable policy, and that is what our group wants, in common with the other groups in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Surely asylum and immigration issues should remain primarily Member States’ responsibility. Flows of immigrants and asylum seekers vary enormously from one Member State to the other, and this leads to different pressures on those states’ institutions that deal with these issues. Furthermore, it is as yet unclear to what extent these proposals will be based on political priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, historically, EU Member States have ties to different parts of the world. Participation in United Nations programmes, like that for Bosnia, should continue, and I would invite a continuing generosity in connection with these programmes on what is a very sensitive issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council’s reactions to the revolutions in the countries on the southern shore can no longer be limited to declarations of principle and short-term objectives. The European Union must move up a gear by proposing concrete, long-term measures. This is the purpose of this resettlement programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion – at last – of the ordinary legislative procedure on this issue and, by extension, the application by all the Member States of the common European programme on the resettlement of refugees, at a historic moment in time, would bear witness to our will to react effectively by working together to propose suitable instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, only 10 Member States participate annually in the resettlement of refugees, and there is no proper coordination when they do. Yet the representatives of the EU Member States have said again in recent months that they support the peoples’ aspirations. This support for the people of partner countries must result in Europe showing solidarity by accommodating refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The European resettlement programme should be an additional tool for protecting refugees and asylum seekers. It should allow for the implementation of a European hospitality policy for resettled populations. It needs to be implemented urgently. We must break the deadlock before the end of 2011, and it is up to the Council to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament recently adopted a report on the European Refugee Fund. In the interests of a faster solution to the situation, the Union should try to strengthen its European Refugee Fund and adopt a sustainable European programme for refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Later, in June, the Council proposed the informal solution of applying a partial codecision procedure. Parliament immediately responded with a counter proposal based on the full codecision procedure, but the Council has yet to make any statement or response. We have lost a lot of time with such injudicious conduct, and unless an appropriate common solution can be found by the end of 2011, there will clearly be no proper exploitation of the options available to the European Refugee Fund. Member States will lose resources allocated by the Fund and refugees will languish in camps. It may also be the case, sadly, that some of them fall victim to human trafficking networks, or even lose their lives. In my opinion, Commissioner, that should be unacceptable to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I would therefore like to appeal for us to find a common solution as quickly as possible, so that we can jointly resolve this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although relatively few have come to Europe, we have all been moved by scenes of men, women and children risking their lives on unseaworthy boats, trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Many drowned in the attempt and the exact number of lives lost in this way will remain unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the figures, last year approximately 5 000 refugees resettled in EU territory, while around 75 000 resettled in the US in the same period. In fact, as a whole, EU Member States currently accept fewer refugees for resettlement than Canada, a statistic that clearly demonstrates that Europe must do much more with regard to immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">But how can we do this, when our failure to agree has already cost us two years and seriously jeopardised additional funding, which countries will be denied if we do not reach an agreement by the end of the year? It is imperative that a European Union joint resettlement programme be agreed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">According to various figures, there should be approximately 6 000 places in Europe for people who can no longer return to their own home, whether they are unwilling to do so for fear of continued persecution or are living in dangerous conditions in their country of first asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">By accelerating this programme, which must become an integral part of EU asylum policy, Europeans would show greater commitment to international solidarity and shared responsibility, while receiving the financial investment needed.</p>
<p class="contents">If not, we will seriously endanger refugees’ new lives, worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in refugee camps and ensure refugees are even easier prey for people trafficking networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Refugee Fund and the European Resettlement Programme are both measures that save the lives of refugees. We all hold in our hands responsibility for those who risk their lives. It is therefore high time that we found a solution and that the Council began to inform us of procedures promptly and in an appropriate manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We voted on this over a year ago, but technical considerations continue to stand in the way of discussions. This is a far cry from the concerns of refugees who live in extremely precarious conditions, without any prospect of their situation improving.</p>
<p class="contents">Now more than ever, we need to take urgent action to finally solve the institutional deadlock that we have been in for too long. Our objective must be to offer practical assistance to the growing number of people seeking resettlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest, granting international protection to those who need it is not simply about granting them a status – even if this is already difficult. It is not just a piece of paper with a stamp on it. No, this is about giving these people the means to rebuild their lives in a safe environment. The figures speak for themselves. In 2010, only 4 700 refugees were resettled in the European Union, which is 4.4% of all those who were resettled during that year. In respect of this somewhat poor record – for that is what it is – let us remember that this programme is aimed at encouraging the Member States to join the collective solidarity movement to which countries like the United States and Canada are already broadly committed. Figures aside, however, it is also the actual content of resettlement and the quality of the European scheme that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This scheme must be based on a number of essential elements. I will mention three: a clear definition of the selection criteria based on notions of vulnerability and protection needs; satisfactory reception conditions as well as access to health care, in particular in the area of mental health, to help refugees get back on their feet; and access to employment or training, along with language lessons to help them become more independent as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are constantly being bombarded with austerity talk, and the argument that it would cost far too much to accommodate refugees. I should like to take this opportunity to point out that if we do not get ourselves out of this stalemate, the money available in the European Refugee Fund could well be unusable by 2013. This just does not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has responsibilities which it can no longer evade. The Member States must commit themselves to making more places available. Good intentions are no longer enough. They must be translated into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is excellent and we hope that they will continue to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of a joint European resettlement programme is of course to pool those resources so that we can make a real difference: for instance, empty a refugee camp or make a real effort to alleviate a very difficult situation in our neighbourhood or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The current events in our neighbourhood have shown the importance of this, but I am sure that in the future there will unfortunately also be a need for this. We can do more in the European Union. As someone mentioned, the US and Canada are doing a lot more and we should do more to take up this challenge. Hopefully Member States will join. If they see that there is a regional resettlement programme that really works, more Member States will join in and it will have even more effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is of course political will. If there is no political will we can have the best system and programme in the world but that will not help. But hopefully that political will will also exist. There are already possibilities today to support resettlement. We have funding from the European Commission and within the regional protection programme there is also a possibility to assist the most vulnerable. We should do everything we can to have this programme in place so that in the future we are better prepared with a more flexible but still a rapid programme that could efficiently enter into force when there is a need.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, the Commission will do its utmost to try to find, in the different compromises that are now circulating, something that all the stakeholders could really find an agreement on and that can be put in place as soon as possible.

<p class="contents">In answer to the question which was asked, I want to respond in general by saying that none of the proposals which has so far been made has met with the approval of the Council. I do want to give my assurance, however, that if a new proposal is put forward or a new possibility appears, we are most willing to consider it and to proceed with it. We do however ultimately expect that the forthcoming Commission proposal on establishing the Asylum and Migration Fund for 2014-2020 will enable Parliament and the Council to achieve extensive improvement of cooperation in this field, taking into account past experience and the undoubtedly growing needs arising from the situation in particular regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
