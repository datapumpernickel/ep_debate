<p class="contents">I should like to place on the record my personal gratitude to Prime Minister Rasmussen for the level of engagement which he has shown with the European Parliament. He set a headline which I hope future presidencies will follow by meeting with the Conference of Presidents prior to the launch of the Danish Presidency. Before the summit meeting in Copenhagen he will again meet with the Conference of Presidents. Exceptionally, at our part-session in Strasbourg on 19 November 2002 he will contribute to our debate on enlargement in the presence of observer MPs from accession states. This is of course in addition to the normal kind of dialogue for which the Prime Minister is here. I wish to express my personal gratitude to him on behalf of the European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fogh Rasmussen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to express my thanks for the positive reception given to me, and I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation of the close and fruitful cooperation between the European Parliament and the Danish Presidency. It is a cooperation to which we attach the utmost importance, and therefore it is a great pleasure for me to note that the cooperation is taking such a positive form.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Presidency have a joint project. We share the same vision; we are working towards a common objective. Enlargement of the EU is the greatest political task of our generation. It is a challenge and an opportunity which extends beyond our own time. For better or for worse, enlargement is rooted in our common history and will be of crucial importance for the lives and opportunities of our descendants. Enlargement of the European Union marks the end of the European tragedy of the twentieth century and is the gateway to a common future in which our people are able to live in freedom, peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of Europe has been haunted by wars, crises and human catastrophe. Yet Europe and our European culture are also characterised by a unique capacity to rise up again, to recover and both to rediscover and redefine their values and aims.</p>
<p class="contents">The twentieth century was a catastrophe for Europe. Two terrible world wars tore our Continent apart. The Armageddon of the Second World War was followed by over forty years of communist dictatorship in Central and Eastern Europe. For almost half a century we lived with an artificial division of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the First World War, our continent was characterised by optimism, self-confidence and faith in the future. These values were drowned out by the thunder of guns in August 1914 and trampled to death in the trenches of the World War. We have never really recovered the optimism and faith in the future that characterised the first years of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement of the EU marks the beginning of a new epoch in European history. Enlargement can instil into Europe a dynamism and strength; it can create the basis for a new European consciousness. Enlargement is the key to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After ninety years – from 1914 to 2004 – we can finally close one of the most bloody and dark chapters in the history of Europe. That is an inspiring task, and a responsibility that puts us under an obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its enduring and unqualified support for the enlargement project. This support was most recently expressed during the negotiations at the plenary session on 23 October and was expressed in strong terms by the President of the European Parliament to the European Council at the Brussels Summit. On behalf of the Presidency, I would like to express my thanks for this clear and strong message from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in view of this that I am pleased to be able to report to you all here today that at the Brussels Summit the European Council confirmed the Member States’ full support of enlargement. We made a number of crucial decisions. These mean that the first round of enlargement negotiations can be concluded in Copenhagen in December. I must emphasise, however, that enlargement is far from secure yet. We still have a huge task ahead of us and limited time available. We are negotiating with 27 countries in total and we have 37 days in which to achieve a result – nothing can be taken for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a road for our further negotiations to follow, however: the Presidency and the Commission have a solid foundation on which to negotiate at the Copenhagen Summit, and that creates clarity. It creates clarity both for the current Member States and for the candidate countries. They will not be faced with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. We will meet them with an offer of practical negotiations and call upon them to make the last crucial effort. There must be no doubt that we in the Presidency will approach this task with all our energy and with an untiring will to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency had three objectives for the Brussels Summit:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we wanted to bring about agreement as to the basis for the final enlargement negotiations with the candidate countries. In other words, decisions on the choice of countries, decisions on the outstanding financial issues and decisions on the final remaining institutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wanted to agree a common EU policy on the issue of transit between Kaliningrad and Russia, to provide a clear basis for negotiations ahead of the EU-Russia Summit on 11 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and thirdly, the Presidency attached great importance to the Brussels Summit taking place in accordance with the decisions made at the Seville Summit. These decisions mean shorter as well as more effective and focused European Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to report that we achieved our objectives in all three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We succeeded in giving the summit a form which reflects the spirit and decisions of Seville. It was a brief Council lasting just over 24 hours with a concentrated agenda which was thoroughly prepared, an agenda which was devised with the greatest possible degree of openness. I may mention that the annotated agenda for the summit could be found on the Presidency’s web site in the weeks leading up to Brussels, allowing everyone to follow the preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally attached great importance to the Brussels Summit being as focused and results-oriented as possible, and I am very pleased with the result. I believe that we succeeded in creating procedures which I hope will serve as inspiration for future presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Kaliningrad, too, the Presidency achieved its aims in Brussels. The European Council supported the detailed conclusions on which the Foreign Ministers had reached agreement on 22 October.</p>
<p class="contents">A basis has thus been secured for further negotiations with Russia. The EU’s policy is clear. We want to find a solution that takes into account Russia’s problems, but at the same time respects the sovereignty of Lithuania and the rules of the Schengen cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, enlargement was the main topic in Brussels. For the Presidency, it was crucial to get the frameworks in place for further negotiations with the candidate countries. We made it very clear to everybody that it was now – and not in December – that the decisions were to be taken and we focused the agenda on the central issues. These were among the reasons why we were able to make the necessary decisions. I will not go through the conclusions of the summit in detail here. The conclusions are brief and clear and speak for themselves, but I would like to highlight the major decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council approved the Commission’s recommendations on the choice of countries. Ten countries – Cyprus, the Czech Republic Estonia, Hungary Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia – will be able to conclude negotiations at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, we decided to support these two countries in their efforts to achieve their aim of accession in 2007. The Copenhagen Summit will make practical decisions on how we strengthen their preparations for accession. The message to Bulgaria and Romania is clear: enlargement will continue and the EU is open to European countries wishing to join which meet the requirements for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We also sent a clear signal to Turkey. The European Council is pleased with the progress that Turkey has made towards meeting the political Copenhagen criterion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We call upon Turkey to continue its process of reform – not least in the form of actual implementation of the reforms adopted. We will make new decisions on Turkey at the Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the choice of countries, we discussed issues of monitoring and safeguard clauses. In this area too, the European Council supported the Commission’s proposal, with one simple adjustment: we extended the period for which the special provisions will apply from two to three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also made decisions on the final outstanding institutional issues, concerning the necessary adjustments in the light of the transition from 15 to hopefully 25 Member States. The Heads of State and Government accepted the compromise already achieved by the Presidency at the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 22 October. This established a clear negotiating basis for the Presidency in relation to the candidate countries in this area as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The most difficult issue on the agenda of the Brussels Summit was the outstanding financial issues. However, we succeeded in obtaining a result. We made three crucial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to direct agricultural subsidies, the European Council supported the Commission’s proposal: phasing in to commence in 2004 at 25% and to be 100% completed in 2013. The phasing in will take place within a framework of financial stability. A promise is being made regarding total annual expenditure on common organisations of the market and direct subsidies in an EU with 25 Member States. This expenditure must not exceed the level for 2006 plus 1% per year, which means that if inflation exceeds 1% there will be a real fall in agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reached agreement on the total level of funding for structural fund initiatives in the new Member States. The figure is EUR 23 000 million in the period 2004 to 2006, which is slightly lower than the Commission’s proposal of just over EUR 25 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the issue of budgetary compensation was settled. I consider it of great importance that we succeeded in establishing that no new Member State must find itself in a worse position during the period from 2004 to 2006 than was the case in 2003. This is an important and correct signal to the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the main points of the European Council and, in conclusion, I would just like to mention that the European Council also met with the president of the Convention on the Future of the EU, President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. He reported on the work of the Convention and we will meet with the Convention’s president again at the Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">‘From Copenhagen to Copenhagen’ – that is the motto of the Danish Presidency. It expresses a vision of contributing to a project and a process that are of a unique character, and it also expresses a very practical ambition to get some of the work that has been placed in our hands concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels Summit took us a crucial step closer to Copenhagen, while at the same time marking the final stop before the Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is to be found on the road from Brussels to Copenhagen? What lies ahead of us in the coming weeks? The answer is: hard work. Hard work and enduring intense negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already in full swing. On 28 October I met the Heads of State and Government of the candidate countries to give them a personal and direct account of the Brussels Summit and as early as the following day discussions with government officials began.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council’s decisions in Brussels have created a basis for further negotiations. It is clear, however, that if we are to achieve a result on time great efforts are needed, along with a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone involved, both Member States and candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Commission have consistently been strong driving forces in the process of enlargement. On behalf of the Danish Presidency I would like once again to thank the European Parliament and the Commission for the sound cooperation and call upon us all to join forces in the weeks ahead too in order to achieve our common aim – to conclude the first round of enlargement negotiations in Copenhagen in December. In this connection, I am very much looking forward to participating in the great enlargement debate here in Parliament in two weeks’ time on 19 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we here in the Community can send a strong message to the people and governments of Europe that the time has come to conclude ten years’ work, that the time has come to open the gates to our common future and that the time has come to make the crucial decision on enlargement.</p>

The Council was well organised and well managed by the Danish Presidency and it allowed us to eliminate all the obstacles standing in the way of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would like to express my warm thanks publicly to Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who made enlargement the top priority of the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been given a mandate to conclude the accession negotiations with ten countries by the end of the year. This gesture by the Council shows great openness towards the ten candidate countries. It demonstrates confidence in them and recognition of the efforts made by their governments, parliaments and civil society in recent years. So we are very pleased for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council, all Member State governments took a step closer to what I believe to be an historic goal. I also want to stress the solidarity the Brussels Council showed towards the candidate countries, which still need financial help to approach the level of development of the rest of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Brussels was the result of constant effort day after day that enabled us to rebut the gloomiest forecasts and to overcome, one by one, all the major obstacles to Europe's unification.</p>
<p class="contents">So ten years on, another crucial chapter of our shared history will be written at Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also gave its backing to the Commission's recommendations on Bulgaria and Romania and approved the target date of 2007 those countries set themselves for accession. We will be proposing the measures needed to draw up a new roadmap and to step up financial assistance and at Copenhagen the European Council will be able to take a decision on these.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, our Regular Report on Turkey was approved: at Copenhagen the European Council will decide on the next stage of Turkey's application on this basis. The elections that have just taken place in Turkey make it all the more necessary to decide at Copenhagen on directions for this new stage.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no time to waste. Last week we presented the conclusions of the Brussels Council to the representatives of the candidate countries. Let me stress that we are not putting a package to the candidates and telling them to take it or leave it: acceptable compromises are clearly possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council accepted our proposals in general and gave us a mandate to negotiate on the institutional and financial chapters still open.</p>
<p class="contents">The allocation of 23 billion euro to the Structural Funds agreed to by the European Council is less than what the Commission originally proposed. Nonetheless, it is a huge amount, in line with the economic and social goals of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, thanks to the efforts of all parties, a very important agreement was reached on agriculture, one of the most sensitive financial issues, to apply from 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">After Copenhagen, Athens will be the next step on the road to enlargement and the accession treaties will be signed there in April 2003. This will allow us to meet our target so the future Member States can take part in the European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality of enlargement is taking form. Of course, there are still some points to follow up and keep an eye on over the next two years and even after the accession of the new member countries, as we said in our Report. I have already told you that six months before accession we will be reporting to the European Council on progress made. And alongside a general economic safeguard clause, two specific clauses can be applied where the new Member States fail to fulfil undertakings given during the negotiations as regards the internal market and justice and home affairs. But these issues are not likely to halt the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work over the coming year will therefore concentrate on this fifth enlargement. In addition to the various formalities required by the accession process, we will need to focus on adjusting the financial perspective for the period 2004 to 2006 and on preparing work within the Commission and the other institutions. In particular we will need to make sure that the acquis is fully implemented throughout the European legal area as from day one following accession. More generally, a thorough look at all our policies is needed to take account of the quantitative and, even more so, the qualitative aspects of the new environment we will be working in after enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">An EU of 25 Member States takes us into a new dimension. We are setting in motion a new social project for the whole of Europe, a project that calls for strong popular support.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration process that started in western European - the original ‘European idea’ - is turning into a plan to unify the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlarging the EU calls for a new philosophy of international relations. It means carrying through an internal reform process that affects all facets of society in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will further accentuate our unity and our diversity - the shared values and distinguishing traits that characterise the EU. The European integration process and Europe's recent history are an acknowledgement of the points we share and those that set us apart. Enlargement will mark the first attempt to create a new type of citizenship on a continental scale. And it will bring a huge increase in citizens' rights and power for the States.</p>
<p class="contents">As we carry through this great joint endeavour, as we stand on the brink of our continent's peaceful unification, we must send a clear message to those States that are not involved in this process but that look to the EU with great expectations. I am thinking of the Balkans. We must tell them that the EU's door is open and we hope to invite them in as soon as possible. We must be clear and unambiguous on this point, on the prospect of membership, and not play tactical games. And we must tell them clearly too that the timetable depends on their determination to carry through the reforms needed for full membership. Our task is to support them in their efforts, setting out a joint agenda that makes instruments and adequate resources available to them and harnessing the full potential of the stabilisation and association process. It is a huge challenge we must respond to adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement also means laying the foundations for clearer relations between the new enlarged EU and our nearest neighbours. Our enlargement strategy and our neighbourhood policy are closely intertwined. We must be able to show that enlargement does not mean excluding those not contemplated by the enlargement strategy, that it does not entail building new walls or erecting new barriers. We need to set about defining more clearly what we mean by a special relationship with the regions near the enlarged EU's borders, stretching from Russia to the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed solution for Kaliningrad, for example, is an important element in our relationship with the Russian Federation, a relationship we need to develop and consolidate. Enlargement is also a terrific opportunity to redefine our role in the world, a chance to devise a new type of political regionalism by reorganising our continent spatially.</p>
<p class="contents">From this new perspective, the basic issues on the table at the European Convention are becoming ever more urgent and we need to tackle them resolutely and courageously. Agreement on the outstanding financial issues does not rule out the need to think about the Community budget. Or to consider whether it is transparent, easy to understand and capable of meeting the new challenges facing us. We have to define the type of resources the EU needs and strengthen the role of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties encountered in ratifying the Treaty of Nice - fortunately now behind us - should not blind us to the need for democratic participation, simplification and greater legitimacy - aims we must seek to achieve through institutional reform. The work the Convention has done - in particular the document its chairman presented recently - is an important contribution and provides a reference for future proposals. I will be talking to you about this topic in the near future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by associating myself with the expressions of gratitude to the Presidency and to Parliament. The pressure exerted by the three institutions together has made the breakthrough in negotiations possible and enabled us to have a solid expectation that this project, the greatest in our time within the European Union, can, as planned, be brought to completion in Copenhagen in December. The post-Brussels political momentum has become even stronger than it was already, and if this Council made anything really visible, it was the shared desire to make a success of this project of uniting Europe, which is becoming ever stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like, briefly, to give you some information on how things have progressed. The President of the Council has already observed that we wasted no time, and that it was as early as Monday last week that we communicated the results to the candidate countries, starting the very next day on a further round of negotiations, which has, in the meantime, been concluded. The object of this round of negotiations was to establish which positions on the part of the candidate countries remain unresolved. We now have a complete overview of everything and of every single item remaining to be sorted out in the negotiations, and here I have both bad news and good news. Let me start with the bad news, which is that there is a great deal more left on the table than we could or should have expected. The good news is that none of it is incapable of being sorted out in the timeframe envisaged, so that it seems realistic in terms of the timetable to conclude a second round of negotiations by the time of the General Affairs Council on 18 November, thus getting a very large number of the still unresolved issues out of the way. This is then to be rounded off by a final round, leading to the accession conferences immediately prior to the General Affairs Council in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with one political observation – one that is of great importance to me. In the few weeks remaining to us, it will be of the utmost necessity that negotiations be conducted in an extraordinarily political way. No longer can we negotiate as we used to – in a very technical way, often with a very large number of questions going backwards and forwards, but now the setting of clear political priorities and the taking of political decisions really are the order of the day. I have to say with some emphasis, that, in past negotiations, we expected a great deal of the candidate countries, and the European Union's positions were not always founded on in-depth understanding of the candidates' problems; rather, they were very often motivated by our own needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to remind you that it is not only public opinion in the Member States that has to be taken into account in wrapping up the package for the final negotiations; we also have to bear in mind the fact that the governments and parliaments in the candidate countries have to convince public opinion on their side that joining the European Union is a good thing. Let me also point out that the results of the process of transformation that we have already seen in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have varied to a wide degree. In the countries in transition, people enjoy freedoms that were hitherto unknown to them; they enjoy democracy and human rights. We should not, though, overlook the fact that it is, as a whole, we who have benefited from the economic advantages and the advantages of stability that these transformations have brought into being. It is we who, to date, have benefited most from the transformation of these countries into market economies, a transformation that involved, and continues to involve, serious social hardship for these people. Now is the time to send out a clear and unmistakeable signal that we honour the enormous achievements that have come about over the last ten years in societies over there, and to do this by forcing ourselves to adopt a certain generosity as the negotiations move into their final stage.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about interfering with this or that fundamental principle of Community policy or of the Community method. Nothing in what the future Member States seek is fundamental from our point of view, but it can be fundamental to them and to their ability to win the support they need, and so I very much hope that we will all – by which I mean the Council, the Commission, and Parliament – summon up the flexibility that will be needed if the project is to be a success, not only for politicians like us, but most especially for those who really matter – the people in the present and future Member States.</p>

As far as the membership of the central European countries is concerned – theirs especially because of their Communist past, although Malta and Cyprus are also involved – they have earned the right to have this great and historic unanimity demonstrated by us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was very favourably struck by the way that you put your remarks in this historic context, and I believe that this is what we have to do. I also want to add, however, that Europe will have successfully completed its probation only as and when the outcome of the Convention on a European constitutional treaty is greeted with the same unanimity by the governments, the Commission and by Parliament, so that Europe may, in the twenty-first century, have stable institutional structures, and the Council of Ministers' principal and greatest task will be to support a Community model, so that this enlarged community of twenty-five – and later even more – States will also have a solid foundation. That is what, right now, I urge you to do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome the fact that the way is now open for ten Central European states plus Malta and Cyprus, that the mandate is on the table, and that now the Commission's and the governments' hard work can be continued, enabling us, Mr President-in-Office, to actually achieve that of which you spoke: ‘From Copenhagen to Copenhagen!’ It will also enable you to say, on the 12 and 13 of December: ‘The Treaties are ready for signature.’ That is what I wish you; that is what I wish for all of us for the sake of Europe's future.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to encourage Bulgaria and Romania to persevere with their efforts. Our group currently maintains close contacts with both countries, but they have a long distance still to cover. As regards Turkey, I will be quite frank in saying that there are different positions in our group concerning its membership in the European Union, for our group is a very democratic one – Christian Democrats and Conservatives could not be anything else – but I will tell you very clearly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council that there is one thing we do agree on, and that is that we do not believe that the time is right to specify a date for the commencement of negotiations in December and in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we welcome the way that both the parties that have won the elections in Turkey are oriented towards Europe, but we also cannot but take note of a democratic deficit, in that 45% of Turkey's voters are not represented in its parliament at all. Let me remind you that the leader of the Justice and Development Party, Mr Erdogan, cannot become prime minister as he is facing charges that make it impossible for him to be the party's chairman. This is an absurd situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you of something that is a matter of European concern, even though it affects my own country, namely that political foundations from the Federal Republic of Germany, not only our own party's, but the ones associated with the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals, are accused of espionage in Turkey. This is an absurd way of going about things, and I ask you to note this as an example of how much more Turkey has to develop.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, I am delighted that the Social Democrats are showing increasing agreement with what I have to say about Turkey, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruptions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and, I hope, also with what I have to say on other subjects. Mr Cohn-Bendit, I will return to the subject of how we took up common positions on the subject of Chechnya, and if our group is in reality to be taken as occupying the middle ground in Parliament on these issues, then that is something that we welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not understand why it was necessary to put the whole agricultural issue on the table in Brussels. Now, thank God, we have to some extent got things right, but we did not understand why a major Member State of the European Union chose that occasion to put the agriculture issue central stage, and I sometimes get the impression – and Mr Daul and Mr Goepel will have more to say on these points – that we do not actually know what was decided there. I hope that will eventually emerge, so that what was actually decided will be known after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself – the Commission, of which we sometimes have criticisms that are not the point at issue today, is on our side in these matters – to involve Parliament in dealing with all the financial consequences for the current financial perspective – on which James Elles is our expert – and also for future financial perspectives, and to do so in such a way that the institutional preparations can be made in this area as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Kaliningrad, it is my urgent recommendation, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we do not give Lithuania in particular the impression that we would make concessions to a large European country, one that does not belong to the European Union, on the back of this rather small future Member State, Lithuania. Lithuania's sovereignty is also at stake, and that is something we should always consider.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this: We will shortly be debating Chechnya with Mr Solana. It really is depressing to read in major European newspapers that Sergei Kovalev, President Yeltsin's former representative on human rights, said yesterday in one of them that the barbaric behaviour of the Russian army continues in Chechnya today just as it did a number of years ago. We decisively reject any form of terrorism, even in Moscow, but we may not treat terror and terrorists and the people in Chechnya as one and the same thing! We urge you to have real courage at the summit that is to be held – not, unfortunately, in Copenhagen but in Brussels, because Russia wanted it that way – you may well have given in to pressure, but it is the substance that matters; real courage to find clear language in which to say that we have to negotiate in Chechnya, and that people there have a future within the Russian Federation without losing their identity. What I would like to see here is not only diplomatic talk from the Heads of State and of Government, but also a tough approach to this matter, because we, being a democratic Union, are under the obligation to stand up for human rights in Europe and throughout the world. I wish you much success in this. Quite apart from anything else, the Danish Presidency of the Council has so far done its job extraordinarily well, which also demonstrates that you do not have to be a big country to be a success in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for having described the issue in appropriate terms: what we need is a political vision and to overcome a division of the continent which has lasted for more than a century. I believe that that is what we have to communicate to our electors.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to remind you that at the meeting you kindly invited us to in Copenhagen, you spoke of the three phases of the Danish Presidency: the first did not depend on you; it was the Irish referendum, the final element of this year’s electoral rally. Finally, it has been won. And furthermore, you have made constructive use of an agreement – the Franco-German agreement on the funding of the agricultural policy – to make progress on an issue which is important in view of enlargement, which is the financial issue. And if you will allow me, Mr President, leaving aside something that we must debate in plenary session at the second reading in November, which is the state of the negotiations and the conditions for each candidate country, I will mention an important issue, that of funding, with a prior warning: I clearly support President Cox in his criticisms of all the governments – beginning with the Presidency – in relation to their continued treatment since Nice of the allocation of seats in the European Parliament. These seats are not bargaining chips at the mercy of the negotiations between countries, and there is still clear discrimination against two candidate countries – namely Hungary and the Czech Republic – on this point. Listen to what we are saying. Try to resolve the problem by listening to us.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conclusions, there is a positive point, and that is that you have accepted that no candidate country should be a net contributor from the outset. I believe it is fair to point this out. However, there is one point on which I believe we must defend the rights of the European Parliament, and of all Parliaments: budgets in all democratic countries are carried out on an annual basis. We have supported the existence of financial perspectives, but clearly we cannot, now that they have abandoned the Soviet five-year plans in Russia, start producing ten-year plans. We cannot.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We cannot bind ourselves politically for the next ten years. What are elections for? What are Parliaments for? I believe that this issue – and I think it is good that progress has been made on it – should be debated more seriously. Why? Because, within the framework of Agenda 2000, the calculations were made on the basis of six countries. There are now ten. We are going to achieve a budgetary miracle: to do more with less. And we have to explain this to our public and to that of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to ask you directly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, about the fifth priority, I believe, which you mentioned at the Copenhagen meeting. You said that we had to continue working on the reform of the agricultural policy. In view of the agreements at the summit, what is Commissioner Fischler going to do? Will he be out of a job? Will he abandon the proposal? Are we going to continue working? And I say this because this Parliament is going to vote tomorrow on a resolution on the mid-term review of the reform of the CAP, and that is important. We cannot act in such a contradictory fashion as to approve what was debated in Brussels last week when that is not compatible with the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">A final observation, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on the Convention. The candidate countries are full participants in the Convention. We are talking about our future. So far progress has been made on a fundamental issue, they have listened to President Giscard d'Estaing who has proposed what is known as – and I think this a terrible expression – the ‘skeleton of the Convention’. I understand how, on the eve of Halloween and the Day of the Dead, we can talk about a skeleton, but now we must put flesh on the bones. We will have to hold a serious debate on this issue. All I want to say is that we must build on the basis of what there is, and what there is is the Community method and the balance between the institutions. And that must be respected and defended.</p>
<p class="contents">You have said that from Copenhagen we are going to return to Copenhagen. You know as well as I do that from Copenhagen, in terms of economic and defence issues, in order to return to Copenhagen we have to pass for the moment through Athens. I would therefore ask you in this respect that the Danish Presidency provide significant impetus, including from the point of view of their full incorporation into the Community acquis.</p>

Certainly, there are a few small stones cluttering up the track, but none of them seems capable of derailing the train bound for Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">What for a long time seemed to be an ill-fated love affair between East and West became a budding romance almost exactly 13 years ago when the Iron Curtain came down and allowed the relationship to blossom fully. Now, we are just about ready for marriage and, as a liberal, I feel incredible pride at the fact that it is a liberal government that is finally blessing the union between these countries. I want to congratulate the Danish Presidency on what it has achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address three issues, Mr President-in-Office: first of all, Turkey. The resolution we shall vote on tomorrow is quite vague where Turkey is concerned. I think it is important for us to do as you did and clearly and unambiguously encourage the forces of reform in Turkey, as well as welcoming the positive signals coming from the new government in Ankara. There remains a great deal to be done before the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled, but I hope that the Copenhagen European Council may mean a qualitative step forwards in relations with Turkey. It is in everyone’s interests that we should have close and continuous relations with Turkey and that we help one another in the fight for increased human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the safety clauses. The more I hear about these, the more confusing I think they are. How are they to be applied, and how are they to be interpreted and put into effect? Have they really been properly thought through? What we really need in the EU is a type of inspection system that comprises all the EU countries, old as well as new, in order to ensure that we <span class="italic">all</span> comply with the democratic values and criteria on which the EU is based: respect for human rights, non-discrimination, good governance, respect for the state governed by law etc. We know that there are Member States which do not at present fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, it was good that a settlement was reached concerning agricultural policy, which was one of the biggest obstacles to the timetable for enlargement. In this way, the Presidency showed that the prophets of doom who condemned the Brussels European Council were wrong. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party would very much like, however, to have seen a clearer reform agenda with express support for Commissioner Fischler’s proposals and for the commitments we made in Doha. Agricultural policy needs to be substantially reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">A fair amount of work remains to be done before the Copenhagen Summit. We must not underestimate the difficulties of this work. The candidate countries must subsequently hold their referendums. I hope that we can all use the run-up to 2004 to engage with people <span class="italic">throughout</span> the continent and explain to them, inform them about and convince them of the importance of unifying Europe, not for our sake but for theirs. It is as Jean Monnet said: ‘It is not states we are uniting, but citizens and people’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, I do not feel that it is very wise to conceal the problems. I shall therefore say this openly and honestly; the decisions of the Brussels European Council have left us unsatisfied. Of course, we welcome the fact that the list of the ten proposed members has been approved, but, in our view, the terms of the agreement reached between the Fifteen on the budgetary and financial issues for the 2004-2006 period do not augur well in terms of the ability, if not the will of the key European leaders to make a reality of a vision of Europe that lives up to the aspirations that I have just outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already seen discrimination in the way that direct aid has been allocated to the farmers of the candidate countries. I was recently able to witness the extremely negative political effect of this measure in some of the countries concerned. In addition to this, the total amount of funding set aside by the Commission for structural actions has been reduced. We feel that this amount was already far from sufficient given the considerable work that needs to be done to combat disparities in development in the future, enlarged Union. It is in the interest of everyone to make a lasting success of enlargement, but the cost that this will certainly entail cannot be, as is the case at the moment, according to current plans, around 0.08% of the fifteen Member States’ GDP for each of the first three years. The medium-term objective must be very ambitious: to provide job security and training for all men and women throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe, to consolidate public services that are worthy of the name, to achieve genuinely sustainable development in all 25 Member States, and as a result combat social and fiscal dumping. We must also redefine the tasks and powers of the European Central Bank and do away with the obsessive rationing of worthwhile public expenditure, which will require a rapid and in-depth revision of the financial perspectives. All these issues must be laid on the table and debated openly, involving the national parliaments and social players.</p>
<p class="contents">At this very moment in Florence, the European Social Forum is setting an example by bringing together citizens and young people in particular from across the continent to discuss the challenges of society and civilisation that we are all facing. If we make a success of enlargement, we will also meet their expectations. I fear that, with the Brussels European Council, we are falling far short of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this fairly uninspiring context, we do, in any case, welcome the fact that the decisions taken at Brussels will allow the Union to present its negotiating position to the candidate countries on time. However, we cannot hide the fact that the agreements on the common agricultural policy are essentially yet another way of putting off difficult decisions until a later date. We can only criticise the Council for not linking the decision on direct payments to a further reform of the CAP and not seeking agreement on the principle of making these payments conditional upon environmental and social requirements, running the risk of perpetuating all those dysfunctional elements and imbalances which make the CAP the most absurd, costly European policy in existence today, harming precisely those small producers of quality produce that we want to reward.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we cannot hide the fact that the candidate countries are not wholly satisfied with the agreements reached in Brussels. Indeed, although it is true that, on paper, the Union has undertaken to offset the new countries’ obligation to contribute 100% to the Community budget as of day one with compensatory payments and Structural Funds appropriations, it is also true that there is no guarantee that these countries will be able to absorb these resources for high-quality projects quickly, or at least not as quickly and directly as they will have to pay out the money to the Union’s budget. We would have preferred gradual phasing-in of these countries’ contributions to the Community budget, as was the case for Spain and Portugal. Quite frankly, the impression is that the new countries will have to fund the United Kingdom’s common agricultural policy abatement and that it was only decided at the last moment not to make them contribute to Spain’s Structural Funds too. As regards the Copenhagen Summit, the Union still has to prove itself. As Prime Minister Rasmussen rightly said, enlargement is not yet completely in the bag.</p>
<p class="contents">One further comment, Mr President, on the question of Chechnya. We wanted the European Council, in addition to making a few general, salient points on terrorism, to come down clearly in favour of a negotiated end to the Chechen conflict, which is marked by the ongoing violence of the Russian troops, and to condemn the contempt for the hostages’ lives and the KGB methods used by the Russian Government to respond to the attack on the Moscow theatre. We are extremely concerned at the arrest of Akhmed Zakayev in Copenhagen and the laws restricting the freedom of speech recently adopted by the Duma. We hope that the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit on 11 November will focus on these issues.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, over the last month, serious momentum has been building up with regard to the process of EU enlargement and the fulfilment of our political vision in this respect. In fact, a trinity of events has taken place which has guaranteed that the pace of EU enlargement has accelerated and is now an unstoppable process.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on 9 October 2002, the Commission concluded that 10 candidate countries were in a position to accede to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on 19 October 2002, the Irish people approved the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which ensure that EU enlargement can take place within an agreed timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU leaders in Brussels on 24 October 2002 endorsed the findings of the European Commission that 10 countries fulfil the necessary political and economic criteria to assume membership of the EU by 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Brussels Summit decision to allow the European Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate countries on all outstanding issues by early November. This will ensure that enlargement negotiations can be concluded by the Copenhagen Summit of EU leaders in December 2002. A target date of April 2003 has also been set for accession treaties to be signed in Athens under the presidency of the Greek Government.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now elements of both legal and political certainty with regard to the enlargement negotiations. We are shortly going to cross the final hurdles so as to bring about the accession of 10 new Member States to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The momentum towards EU enlargement is bringing real challenges to the EU institutions in terms of implementing the internal changes as laid down in the Treaty of Nice. This includes a range of issues including the extension of qualified majority voting at Council level, the re-weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of codecision measures to the European Parliament and the reform of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The future financing of EU enlargement was a centre-stage issue at the Brussels Summit. It is clear from the Presidency Conclusions that the financial perspective, as laid down in Berlin in 1999, is going to be respected in its entirety. The cost of the EU enlargement will be borne from within the budgetary parameters of the Berlin Agreement. It is also clear that programmes such as the present CAP arrangements for the period 2000-2006 are not going to be affected by the decision of the EU leaders in Brussels. This is only right and proper because our farmers, their families and rural communities were all given legitimate expectations by the CAP deal of spring 1999. They were told how the common agricultural policy was going to operate for a seven year period until 2006 and they were basing their commercial decisions on this framework as laid down in the Berlin Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As the corollary decision to this decision taken by the EU leaders, the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy will be just that – a review of the CAP rather than a reform. This may not be music to the ears of the proponents of sweeping CAP reform but that is the reality of the conclusions of the Brussels Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, when it comes to addressing the challenges of EU enlargement, certainty, determination and commitment are all words that can be used to sum up the opinions of the vast majority of the people living in Europe as well as those of legislators working on these important issues within the different EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore believe that he would have seen the Brussels Summit for what it really was. In actual fact, the decisions taken at Brussels, and the agreement between France and Germany in particular, are a serious threat to the future. France has agreed to stabilise agricultural policy expenditure after 2006, when the number of European farmers will be more than twice its current level and in doing so, the President of the French Republic is adopting the incredible attitude of ‘<span class="italic">après moi, le déluge</span>’. Unless this is a sign of the anticipated surrender – the most likely outcome – of the European Union at the next round of WTO negotiations that were scheduled in Doha and which are, in fact, due to be completed in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, following the Stability and Growth Pact, which was a victim of its own stupidity; it is now the European agricultural policy that is condemned because of Europe’s trade policy. We are now expecting competition policy – another of the Commission’s much-vaunted areas of excellence – to collapse under the weight of its overwhelming infallibility.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains, Mr Prodi, of the policies over which the Commission claims to have sovereign authority? Do you want to lose out substantially in the new division of powers on which the Convention is working, that you would otherwise not be able to achieve?</p>
<p class="contents">What is more serious is that since Nice, the European Union seems to be rushing headlong from one summit to the next, as if Europe were trying to conceal its concern and to regain some composure in the eyes of others. Enlargement has therefore come at a good time. The imminent integration of Asia Minor will, no doubt, be a considerable consolation in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear, however, that at least one category of citizens will not benefit from these policies after 2006, and this is the French farmers. In fact, Jacques Chirac has just made further concessions in the area of the common agricultural policy which, at this stage, constitutes genuine capitulation in mid-campaign. By agreeing to cap common agricultural policy expenditure for the 2007-2013 period at 2006 levels, Chirac is salvaging what he can from the current situation, only to sacrifice French farmers after 2007. The agricultural budget will be the same with 25 Members as it is currently with 15, and in addition, from 2004 to 2013, the direct aid for CEEC countries will increase from 25% to 100% of what farmers in the Fifteen currently receive. In this case, it will be France who will bear the major costs of enlargement and of the cap on spending.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is that the American members of the Cairns Group will demand, within the framework of the WTO, not only the elimination of export refunds, but also substantial reductions in customs duties and domestic support, particularly direct aid.

The British Conservative Party has argued strongly and consistently in favour of the enlargement eastwards of the EU since the Berlin Wall fell some 13 years ago. Indeed, the manifesto on which I and my colleagues were elected in 1999 states quite clearly the reasons why we support this process so enthusiastically. It stated that enlargement is an historic opportunity to advance the principles for which Europe should stand: free trade, free markets, deregulation and cooperation. It would also mean more trade, more stability and more prosperity for the existing Member States of the European Union. Furthermore, the European Union simply cannot ignore the moral duty that it owes to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At Brussels, significant progress was made towards achieving agreement on the entry of 10 applicant states at the Copenhagen Council in December. My party warmly welcomes this. Europe will be a better place as a result of enlargement and I congratulate the Danish Presidency on the skill and the commitment it has displayed in reaching this point.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given the fact that we have waited 13 years for this historic moment, I want to reiterate that there must be no foot-dragging, no more delays and no more last-minute vested interests should be allowed to stand in the way. On no account should we allow budgetary discussions to be derailed by reopening issues that have been long settled, in particular, the continuation of the British budgetary abatement, which was agreed unanimously by heads of government at Berlin in 1999. This budgetary abatement is both fair and justified and any attempt to use it as a smokescreen to disguise unwillingness to reform the CAP must be dismissed as political opportunism.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that those Member States which most actively promote CAP reform, including the British Prime Minister, were so comprehensively out-manoeuvred at Brussels. I hope they recover their negotiating skills by the time we get to Copenhagen.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for being able to keep hold of the big picture and not allowing the summit to be side-tracked by arcane details and what are relatively small amounts of money. We must never lose sight of the fact that the benefits of enlargement far outweigh the costs. The costs of not enlarging are far greater than the costs of enlarging.</p>
<p class="contents">You may recall that at a previous debate I took inspiration from the late, great Elvis Presley when he said 'it's now or never'. I would like to take inspiration today from a rather lesser personage, Mr Iain Duncan Smith, who yesterday said to the Conservative Party 'unite or die'. The same principle of course applies to the European Union. I am glad to see the Brussels Summit demonstrate that Europe is more capable of learning that lesson than the British Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise the Danish Presidency's enthusiasm for wishing to carve out a road from Copenhagen to Copenhagen, but I want to be clear that Copenhagen is not the end of the process – hopefully it is the beginning of the end of the process. There is still a lot of work to be done by the candidate countries, we still have a ratification process, and this Parliament will take its assent powers very seriously indeed. We will only vote 'yes' if we are clear that a proper deal has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must not allow the candidate countries to think the process is over. I would like to remind everyone that the Commission will be producing a further progress report six months before the date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for establishing an indicative framework for further agricultural spending which in no way prejudices future reform of the CAP, nor future discussions on financing the European Union, nor our international trade commitments in the Doha round. It allows us to move forward but still leaves this discussion open for us to reach a sensible conclusion to that debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased with the wording of the resolution on Bulgaria and Romania. I recently represented the Socialist Group in Romania, and was singularly impressed by the progress that is being made under the current government, which has finally got to grips with some of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the decision of the Council to increase the safeguard clauses from two years to three years, although I am concerned by the wording which says that these could apply from day one of accession. I assume that relates to the Commission's report six months before the date of accession, but I must say it would not give a good impression to the voters, either in the accession countries or in the European Union, if we start to apply safeguard clauses from day one. Quite frankly, if those are necessary, those countries should probably not be coming into the European Union at that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC, I would remind the Council that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union, it is not a candidate country, it does not have a veto over European Union affairs. Therefore, our number one priority on Kaliningrad is to guarantee the sovereignty of the Lithuanian State and its ability to enter Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Council on resolving the issues relating to the financing of the closure of Ignalina power station. This shows a remarkable sign of solidarity from the existing Member States towards a small candidate country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission's regular report marks a critically important step for Romania, and, I would guess, for Bulgaria as well. Yet Romania has concerns that her own entry date may somehow be held up by the energy and commitment that we are putting into the first ten.</p>
<p class="contents">From Parliament, we can send a clear signal of our intent by endorsing Romania's chosen target date of 1 January 2007. Yesterday, in the Foreign Affairs Committee, we agreed to do just that. I hope that this will be passed by Plenary too. After all, we in Parliament thought of the date of 2004 in the beginning, and the same date is appropriate for Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Turkey, the EU is a secular group of institutions and therefore religion is no barrier to membership. I believe it would be a right and proper endorsement if we were able to send a signal to the new Turkish Government that if it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria of democratic values deeply entrenched and implemented in law, then perhaps the date of June 2004 would be appropriate for negotiations.</p>

Of course, it ratified the list of the ten new future members of the European Union, which is wonderful! Could it really have done anything else, however, without sparking a crisis, or even a disaster? At the same time, though, the Council has not really provided itself with the financial resources needed to perform this enlargement successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of Fifteen will therefore welcome ten new members, on the condition that they are docile and that they agree to do what the 15 Member States often do not do themselves. And I say this because it is my view, even though I remarked upon Commissioner Verheugen’s spirit of openness. What is certainly more serious is that this enlargement could have been or could be a way of enriching the Union with even greater diversity provided by these ten new countries and by taking greater account, in parallel, of the diversities of the current 15 States. We could have encouraged greater pluralism. We instead used the steamroller technique and continued to disregard genuine social needs, public services and citizenship in every meaning of the word. The only things that count, in the long run, are the market and free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, therefore, barring a disaster, there will be 25 EU members. But if we do not redress the balance now, we will then only have one great liberal market subject to two restrictions, namely US policy restrictions, on the one hand, and global economic and financial restrictions on the other. So, instead of a democratic Europe of the citizens, which was the dream of the founding fathers of this Europe, we shall have a sort of Meccano house that is likely to collapse as soon as it encounters the first major crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it may give us many headaches if we do not establish adequate levels of funding, since many citizens like myself do not believe that it can be done when we are twenty-five countries with the money we have for fifteen. Particularly in terms of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth, yes, but guaranteeing the basic pillars, real cohesion, real convergence. Ambition, yes, but we must also accept that we need a greater budgetary contribution which reflects, in all respects, the challenge of this enormous political project, since to extract as much as possible from the present budget will not be sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three days later, however, before the Convention, he presented a preliminary draft entitled the ‘Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe’. There is a very considerable shift between the two meetings and it is a shame that this was not discussed at the Council meeting. The shift is even more marked when compared to the Laeken mandate, which simply raised the question as to whether the simplification of the treaties that it called for might not – and I quote – ‘lead in the long run to the adoption of a constitutional text’. I stress the words ‘in the long run’. And what is more, the Laeken mandate was itself developing in line with the Nice mandate, which did not even mention any possible constitutional element. These successive shifts can be easily explained by the backstage manoeuvring of the federalists and by the lack of any opposition within the Convention, based on the defence of national sovereignty, that is proportionate to its influence on the general public. A lack of realism can thrive when there is no one to question it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are excited about it and would like to congratulate the Commission and the Council on this. It fulfils the fondest wish of the vast majority of European citizens, as it was, in the past, far from self-evident that this wish would be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, many have already forgotten this. Enlargement became to them a question of money and some politicians speculated on fear, self-interest and other negative traits which they believed to be widely present at grassroots level. They knew very well that it is our security and prosperity that will benefit from enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">To my chagrin, the Dutch parliament, in particular, has been guilty of this type of behaviour, even as recently as this week. Since the Dutch Government was sensible enough to take the right decisions, a majority in the Chamber suddenly extended an invitation to the government right at the end to examine the options of a referendum on accession after all, although the formula is such that the government has still been given time to respond negatively. Domestic opportunism has prevailed over clarity and responsible policy in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Council and the Commission, for their part, comment on the options and advisability of referendums on enlargement in the current Member States? Also, could you indicate the principal difference between referendums in the current Member States and those in the states that are candidates for membership? What would be the effect of a negative outcome of a referendum in a Member State or in one or more candidate countries, respectively? I should like to receive a response to this from the Council and, if possible, from the Commission, because this is, of course, of major importance for the purpose of publicity and information provided to the Dutch people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on Chechnya. The group chairman has already commented on this, and rightly so. This is a fight against terrorism, but we could employ diplomatic means to find a solution. I would also ask the Council whether the EU has a policy on Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a compromise with which it is possible to live, but many speakers have already alluded to the fact that it is no substitute for reform of European agricultural policy. I wish to call upon you, Mr President of the Council, to do something that is made urgent by the decision we are to take tomorrow, namely, to maintain dialogue with Parliament on agricultural policy reform, without leaving out the Commission or, when he comes up with sensible proposals, Commissioner Fischler, who is responsible for these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the safeguard clause, to which reference has already been made, is an important factor in building our countries' confidence that reforms and the reform process in the candidate countries will be continued with. I would ask you, Mr President of the Council, to see to it that this safeguard clause also includes consultation with the countries concerned, so that the procedure may be one on which there is general agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In third place comes the issue of Turkey. Both of you have let it be known that we can look forward to decisions specifically relating to Turkey being taken in Copenhagen. It is my opinion that any response to the new government has to be a cautious one. There is no need for it to be met with mistrust, greeted with premature praise, or declared to be whiter than white. This government must first demonstrate its ability to implement the decisions taken by the previous parliament, to recognise human rights and the rights of minorities, and Turkey has to show its ability to handle a change of government without military intervention. Any promises we make to Turkey must be ones that we are prepared to keep over the next few years. Our actions in this area will be judicious if we bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that it is tactically astute not to discuss further steps towards enlargement right now, but I would like to emphatically underline what was said by the President of the Commission. Particularly as regards the Balkans, it is important to indicate by word and deed – as Brussels has done – that when these countries are prepared to implement economic reforms, when they are ready to give recognition to human and minority rights, when they are ready to take the road that leads to full democracy, then the Balkan countries can join the EU – not today, not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow. This is a clear signal that they should take the road to democracy and the acknowledgement of human rights, and an incentive for them to do so.</p>

But I have questions on budgets, on Cyprus and on further enlargement on which I would like further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly the budgets: we welcome the overall approach agreed between the institutions on budgetary and financial issues but, as a parliament, we would like to be fully informed by the Commission on the stage of negotiations and set up a process of dialogue with the Council so we can come to conclusions at the end of the year. In so doing, firstly, we would like some clarity about potential new obligations on foreign policy which could arise as a result of enlargement. We have asked for a report from the Commission regarding this which we are awaiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, agricultural reform: in the House of Commons, upon his return from the European Council, Mr Blair said that he was fully supportive of the first point of the agreement on additional limits on expenditure; he was not in support of the price for it – no CAP reform. That was defeated at the summit. The question to the President of the Commission is whether this reform is still on course and what has now happened to the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, I would like to pick up Mr Barón Crespo's point. It is not usual for us to be in agreement, but certainly when it comes to financial perspective of 1999, I was against it for precisely the same reasons that he mentioned – how can you plan so far into the future? And, at least until 2013, the Parliament itself must be involved in the negotiation of this financial perspective once the negotiations are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of Cyprus, I would like a clear statement that neither the Commission nor the Council intends to set a date for the opening of negotiations. We must have the full and fair implementation of the Copenhagen criteria in political and economic matters. Perhaps, above all, it is a decision for the Member States and not for other countries to take a decision as to when a date should be set for Turkey to start negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the point raised by Mr Swoboda, it is critically important that we set out a strategy for a 'new neighbours' initiative and that Copenhagen should provide a mechanism whereby we can really come to terms with those countries which could be potential candidates. We need a strategy on how to handle the demands which we will face in the months and years ahead. It is not sufficient that we should simply say everybody is welcome, because I believe there is a limit to the matters of EU enlargement and this should be thought about now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You took this step under particular circumstances which will also enable us to reassure our populations thanks to this general safeguard clause. I think that this is a good sign. In taking this step, you also broke down the barrier represented by the financial block. This is wonderful! We shall take note of what has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We would, however, like to express our concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the much-needed reform of the common agricultural policy. This reform cannot wait until 2007, as it will only increase injustice and encourage the new member countries to adopt an approach based on maximum productivity. This reform is all the more necessary because, as of 2007, the agricultural budget will be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we reaffirm our support for Commissioner Fischler’s proposals and we support the idea of a mid-term review, which can alone enable us to redefine the future prospects for all farmers, and not just for large cereal producers. It is the only way to reform the markets which need these reforms immediately, whether in the milk, sugar or olive oil sectors. This is the only way to encourage the development of the rural pillar that is so badly needed, by means of compulsory modulation. It is the only way to make our common agricultural policy match our ambitions in the area of development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three further points to make. With regard to Kaliningrad, well done on respecting Lithuania’s sovereignty, although this will mean nothing if the Union fails to use all the resources at its disposal to bring an end to the lawless situation in Kaliningrad, which has been caused by a deterioration of the economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, well done on the objective set in terms of a timetable, but do not lower your guard in terms of pre-accession aid for these countries, which need it so badly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us remain consistent: we want a Union that is underpinned by the principle of secularity like a school of democracy and tolerance. Let us be vigilant towards Turkey therefore. Let us demand the Copenhagen criteria, all the criteria, both political and economic, but avoid making the issue of religion a reason for refusing Turkey entry to the Union, on the grounds that this country is mainly Muslim. This Union must be an open and tolerant Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, obviously, I have completely misunderstood the fact that we have resolved overnight the issue of the common agricultural policy. The President of the Commission said that the common agricultural policy has been solved. I feel that what has actually happened is that the agreement between President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder went in some way to undermine the way in which Commissioner Fischler was proposing his reforms. The other day when he spoke to the Agriculture Committee I felt very much that he will be a strong leader in his mid-term review and will carry the reforms through.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted that one of the proposals is that we reform the Agriculture Committee and go for codecision. I hope the Council and the Commission will support this because it will help to reform the common agricultural policy. We would have a totally different agricultural policy if the Agriculture Committee had codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also heard many vague ideas about how we are going to reform it and I put to you one or two ideas that I believe to be important. I ask the Commissioner, how will modulation work? How are we going to cope if we do not really reform the common agricultural policy in Commissioner Fischler's mind when we come to discuss the WTO negotiations? There has been talk about capping the common agricultural policy and yet there has been no mention of how we are going to use the funding from Pillar One to Pillar Two. How are we going to fund the new proposals in Pillar Two?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to speak particularly for my constituents in East Anglia, many of whom have not drawn on the common agricultural policy because they grow crops which have never been subsidised by this Union. They are going to be disadvantaged because, under the new proposals, there will be a payment on historical claims. I urge the Commission to rethink that and look at the old IACS forms. You have the measurements, make sure you look at those before you take a final decision. Let us make sure we have an agricultural policy which helps our farmers, helps the budget and helps the new democracies.</p>

I want to make four comments in this regard, comments that I hope you, Mr President of the Council, will be able to take to heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission, in its latest report, is eloquently silent on the stipulation of a deadline for the possible commencement of negotiations – I have to put it in such precise terms. No doubt there are reasons for this. Put more simply, the Commission, and, I believe, the overwhelming majority in Parliament too, does not believe that, at the moment, progress has been made to a sufficient degree as to make it possible to come to definite agreements with Turkey concerning the commencement of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have already experienced a situation in which many MEPs, who are still with us, told this House that barring Turkey from the customs union would inevitably drive it into the arms of the Islamic fundamentalists! The head of government at the time was Tansu Ciller, who paraded this argument through the country, saying, ‘for God's sake, give me a pro-European perspective, or else the Islamists will win the election!’ Six months later, this lady formed a coalition with Mr Erbakan. What a credible policy!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this whole troupe of politicians – Yilmaz, my much-respected colleague Cem, and Mrs Ciller especially – has been dramatically turfed out of office in Turkey and replaced by a political tendency that has to date taken a totally different approach. Suddenly, we have reached that point in the situation, when people say: Oh yes, the ones who used to be pro-European, the ones we always called the guardians of the pro-European perspective, have been kicked out of office and their opponents are now in government, but they are being given at once what we refused to the others for years on end! That cannot be for real!</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I ask you to consider the following. No party has made greater difficulties for itself in rejecting measures towards reform than the present-day AKP. In the election campaign, they even explicitly rejected a whole range of the reform measures that we had demanded. Now, we are all politicians, and if we were all, every day, measured against the statements we made in election campaigns, we would all be the worse for it! I know that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, you in particular! But every government has the right to be judged, not by its words, but by its deeds. By the time Copenhagen comes around, the present Turkish Government will have been in office for just six weeks. Give them a bit more time, so that they can be judged on their actions.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that is the right way to ensure that people do not say one thing in Parliament and then, for whatever reasons, suddenly take up another position in the Council of Ministers, for there is one thing that must be clear: the attempt must not now be made to make good the damage done to the election campaign by German foreign policy stance towards the USA over Iraq, by doing more damage through the ill-timed announcement of a starting date for negotiations with Turkey. I think that, on this issue, we have to be perfectly clear in our own minds that the credibility of the whole accession process is dependent on the criteria being applied in precisely the same way to every single country, and on the timetable for it being adhered to.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President of the Council, I would very much like to congratulate you on the work done by you and your government to date, including what has been done to prepare for the enlargement of the European Union. Together with the President of the Commission, you have to handle Monday's summit with Russia, which, among other things, has to do with the Kaliningrad question. It is my belief that there are two things that have to be dealt with together. On the one hand, the enlargement of the European Union and of NATO means that bridges have to be built to Russia, that important country, but Europe's history means that the European Union must also show itself to be the protector of small countries and that, in any arrangements reached in connection with the Kaliningrad question, the status and sovereignty of small countries must be taken into account if we want to become a credible Union. I wish both Presidents a very great deal of success in this incredibly difficult undertaking.</p>

I am also pleased that the Dutch Government did not put a spanner in the works. This is mainly thanks to the opposition in the Dutch parliament, who were aware of their enormous responsibility. Further to what Mr Oostlander said, I am secretly hoping that the Netherlands will not raise any more unnecessary obstacles on the path to completing the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia, the country for which I am responsible, has reacted with great relief to the events of the past few weeks, including, of course, the referendum in Ireland. After a tumultuous start in the 90s, Slovakia has managed to catch up with those in the lead in the negotiating process, for which it deserves a huge compliment. However, as for the other candidate member states, it is too early for them to rest on their laurels. A great deal of work needs to be done before 2004. In my view, the Heads of Government were right to adopt the Commission's recommendations about creating guarantees with regard to the implementation of EU rules, including the recommendation to shorten the duration of the safeguard rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also draw your attention specifically to the fight against the corruption that is still too widespread in many candidate member states. Thanks to enlargement, we will be getting new neighbours, countries that are also knocking on the doors of the EU. We cannot deal with their questions now as we are now focusing on the forthcoming enlargement. However, we do expect the Commission and the Council, at the end of the negotiations and after the Copenhagen Summit, to table specific proposals to strengthen relations with those countries. In this connection, we will also need to address the question as to what prospects we can offer countries such as the Ukraine. As President Prodi rightly stated a moment ago, enlargement should not lead to exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Agreement on the financial aspects of enlargement has removed the last major obstacle which stood in the way of concluding the accession negotiations with ten countries at the December Copenhagen Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that in relation to the sensitive area of the future financing of the common agricultural policy that EU leaders agreed that direct payments to farmers in current EU Member States would remain stable until 2006. This will guarantee the continuing goodwill of current EU farmers towards enlargement. If this is to be maintained, it is important that degressivity is not introduced after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">On a related issue, it is important to note that some concerns had been expressed that the applicant countries would have been able to export food products which were not up to current EU food safety standards. I should add that these concerns were not necessarily motivated by opposition to enlargement. They were rather more influenced by a wish to prevent any repetition of the BSE and foot and mouth disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that one of the important declarations at the Summit confirmed that there would be a safeguard clause on food safety included in each of the accession treaties. Under it, if a candidate country does not meet EU safety standards, it will not be allowed to sell food products in the internal market. As well as reassuring consumers, it will also remove another weapon from the armoury of those who have reservations about enlargement going ahead as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by not only congratulating the Danish Presidency once again and welcoming the fact that its confidence proved to be right, but also by wishing it a similar success at the Copenhagen Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a fact of life that geographically – apart from a few missing enclaves – Europe is turning into a huge entity with massive economic and political clout, the future of which is beginning to look interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">The single currency, enlargement, efforts to bring about a common defence and security policy and the work being carried out by the convention clearly show that Europe is moving and is moving dynamically. Enlargement is without doubt a positive development on the road to European unification. However, it still has problems to resolve and questions to answer. There are matters which need clearing up in the agricultural sector, for example. And it is the agricultural sector, the CAP, with its massive fund of experience and coherence, that has been <span class="italic">the </span>common reference point for European as opposed to national policy from the birth of the EEC through to the present day. Enlargement must help strengthen this common policy, not upset the balanced compromise achieved, be it between the 15 or the 25 Member States of the Union. Numerous candidate countries are behind economically and do not have the administrative wherewithal to apply the acquis communautaire<span class="italic"> </span>efficiently and these too are problems we need to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Do these or other problems detract from the huge, positive contribution of enlargement to the future of Europe? No, they do not. Enlargement makes a most positive contribution to the future of Europe, the importance of which will become more and more apparent with each passing day.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress how important it is that Cyprus has been included as a new Member State. By integrating Cyprus into the European Union, the outermost point of Europe and its Mediterranean dimension have now been covered. I am positive that at some point – be it before or after integration – this development will help resolve the political problem that has beset Cyprus for years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EUR 40 billion a year that the European Union spends on the CAP is an expensive way to distort our farming industry. British citizens, who already contribute disproportionately to the EU budget, pay twice for the CAP: once through their taxes, and again in the supermarket. An opportunity for early reform has been lost.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of European defence policy was also addressed by the European Council. The United Kingdom has a special interest and responsibility in this area. After all, it was the British Prime Minister who gave the green light to this misguided policy in 1998 and now he has promised significant elements of Britain's already over-stretched armed forces to fill any capability gaps given the complete lack of willingness on the part of most other European countries to upgrade their defence capabilities in any meaningful way.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very moment when we should be concentrating on meeting the terrorist threat and on possible conflict with Iraq, the defence annexes to the Presidency Conclusions are Ruritanian in their complexity and in their irrelevance. To add to the confusion and waste, European allies are now toying with two separate sets of military capability improvements: those for NATO and those for the European Union. Resources are scarce and the last thing we need is two different sets of capability goals.</p>
<p class="contents">For over a year now, diplomatic and military staff energy has been wastefully expended on negotiating EU access to NATO resources. This is an entirely self-generated problem which, furthermore, raises unnecessary difficulties for key allies such as Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the very dangerous involvement of the European Convention in defence matters. One of its working groups is examining ways in which even collective defence, a core task of NATO, might become a European Union responsibility. What signal does this send to our American allies? Perhaps more significantly, what signal does this send to potential enemies?</p>
<p class="contents">What a pity it is that the Council and the Commission do not focus their efforts on putting the European Union house in order before enlargement instead of grandiose<span class="italic"> </span>political schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fogh Rasmussen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Thank you, Mr President. I would like to express my thanks for a good debate. I am looking forward to being able to continue our discussions in the great enlargement debate here in Parliament on 19 November.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, I would like to thank you for the many positive remarks made concerning the Presidency’s efforts so far and concerning the course of the Brussels Summit. The Presidency will do its utmost to live up to the confidence that has been expressed here today. I would like to emphasise that hard work will be required over the coming weeks. As Mr Verheugen said, there are a great many issues to be solved. There is a need for considerable political will, but I would like to say that the European Council convinced me that this political will exists and the debate that we have had here today in Parliament has underlined the same thing – that there is a strong political will within the European Union for this enlargement to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">A great many issues have been raised, and there is no way that I can respond to them all. I will therefore concentrate in my response on a number of the main topics that were raised by various Members.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, there is the issue of Turkey. Mr Poettering, Mrs Malmström and Mr Schulz all raised the issue of Turkey and the decision on Turkey which may be made at the Copenhagen Summit. Above all, I would like to establish that the very important decision concerning the fact that Turkey is now a candidate country was taken right back at the EU’s Helsinki Summit in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a candidate country. As I have said, this was decided by the European Union back in 1999, and it is my clear opinion that as a candidate country Turkey must be treated like any other candidate country. In other words, Turkey will be able to obtain a date for commencing accession negotiations if and when Turkey fulfils the political criteria. Vice versa, it is important to emphasise that the political criteria must be fulfilled in full in order for the country to be given such a date. Turkey must not be measured by different standards to the other candidate countries. Turkey must be treated exactly like any other candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council in Brussels, we expressed recognition of the progress that has been made. The Commission made it clear in its progress report that Turkey does not yet fulfil the political criteria. Naturally we must now keep a close eye on political developments in Turkey following the elections that have been held, and we must then find a balanced solution at the Copenhagen Summit. I consider it too early at present to give a final answer regarding the decision which may be made at the Copenhagen Summit, but let me stress that in order to obtain a date Turkey must fulfil the conditions just like every other candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic that has been raised by various Members is agriculture and budgets. Mr Poettering started by asking why we were discussing the long-term financial outlook of the EU Summit here in Brussels at all. Well, the answer is very simple: it was a precondition for the Presidency and the Commission being given a mandate to complete negotiations with the candidate countries, because certain countries made it a requirement that a decision <span class="italic">had</span> to be taken on the long-term financial outlook. My opinion the whole time has been that we must not set new advance conditions for a decision concerning enlargement of the EU, but we reached this compromise, which I consider to be a reasonable compromise. Then Mr Barón Crespo and Mrs Malmström asked: yes, but does the decision made at the EU’s Brussels Summit mean that we can still discuss reforms and agricultural policy? Here, I would like to make it clear that the EU’s Brussels Summit expressly did <span class="italic">not</span> take a position on the matter of future reforms of agricultural policy; therefore the conclusion is that the Commission’s mid-term review remains on the table. The Council will continue to discuss the Commission’s mid-term review of agricultural policy. Moreover, I know that, as early as this afternoon, a debate will take place in which the Danish Minister for Food will participate as President-in-Office of the Council and this emphasises the fact that the mid-term review is still on the table. In this respect, I might refer to some key phrases in the conclusions of the Brussels Summit, in particular section 12, which states that direct payments etc etc would be introduced without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the financing of the European Union after 2006, nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions, nor to the international commitments entered into by the Union, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the launching of the Doha Development Round. These are very important statements because they mean that the European Union can of course continue to meet its international commitments within the frameworks of the Doha negotiations, and they also mean that the mid-term review is still on the table, is still up for negotiation and will be decided in accordance with the applicable procedures in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the safeguard clauses was also raised. The issue of safeguard clauses was mentioned by Mrs Malmström, along with others. I would like to emphasise that there are two types of safeguard clause. Firstly, there is a general safeguard clause, and secondly, there are two specific safeguard clauses. The two specific safeguard clauses concern the common market and legal and internal affairs. As far as the general safeguard clause is concerned, it is symmetrical in the sense that it can be invoked by both old and new Member States. Where the specific safeguard clauses are concerned, these can only be invoked in respect of the new Member States, but it is an important aspect that the point of the safeguard clauses is actually to avoid them being invoked; they will only be invoked if the new countries do not abide by the acquis that they have undertaken to abide by and, since we expect them to abide by this acquis, I hope that the issue of invoking safeguard clauses will not become relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the general safeguard clause, I would like to underline the fact that we are already familiar with these from earlier enlargements of the EU. In fact, we have always had safeguard clauses. I may mention that when my own country – Denmark – joined the then EC, there was a safeguard clause lasting for five years. The level of trust in Denmark was thus not sufficient to reduce the requirement to less than five years. When Spain and Portugal acceded to the EU, there was a safeguard clause lasting up to seven years. When Sweden, Finland and Austria became members, there were safeguard clauses lasting up to one year. We are thus already familiar with safeguard clauses and therefore it is not a case of discrimination against the new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Kaliningrad, as mentioned by Mr Poettering, Mr Titley and Mr Brock. I would like to say to Mr Poettering that the EU-Russia Summit was not moved to Brussels following demands by Russia – it was a decision made by the Danish Government without anyone having requested us to do so. We will not allow ourselves to come under pressure, but neither do I want to spend time discussing with anyone where a summit is to be held. If Mr Putin does not want to come to Copenhagen, we can use another location. I do not want to spend time on this. We are giving priority to enlargement of the EU. I will not therefore get involved in matters of diplomacy and protocol concerning where meetings are to be held. The most important thing is that the meetings are held and that the things which need to be discussed are discussed and that the decisions that need be made are made.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is what I hope we can do at the summit between the EU and Russia, that is, make a decision on Kaliningrad as well – a decision which abides by the principles emphasised by a number of Members of this Parliament; in particular, that whatever solution is found must be based on full respect for the sovereignty of Lithuania. In this respect, I would like to stress that purely in principle, enlargement of the European Union can very easily take place without a solution to the Kaliningrad issue. If there is no solution a visa will simply be introduced. It is that simple. Naturally, however, we all have a common interest in finding a solution jointly with Russia, because we have an overall interest in developing a strong strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union. Of course, Russia does not have a veto over enlargement of the EU. We must try to find a reasonable solution to transit from Russia to Kaliningrad, but this must be done with full respect for the sovereignty of Lithuania. The Danish Presidency will keep a watch on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me once again to thank you for a very fruitful debate. With a debate on the future of Europe, with a proposal for the frameworks for a new constitutional Treaty and with the possibility of concluding accession negotiations with ten new Member States in just over a month’s time, we are in the midst of crucial decisions – we are standing on the threshold of a new epoch in European history. And enlargement of the EU is the driving force behind all this – it is the key to Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency have together fought for enlargement. The end is now in sight, and we have today confirmed our common will to see it through and conclude the first round of enlargement negotiations in Copenhagen in December.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, I will be very brief, for the Danish Prime Minister has given an exhaustive illustration of the key points of today’s debate and I fully agree with what he has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to make a general comment regarding some of the points raised. It is interesting to see that the entire House – like the Council – is in agreement on enlargement. The debates and questions have focused on minor issues and on the progress we need to make on these issues in the future. This kind of consensus really is extremely rare.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a number of points which have not been addressed in the other replies. The first is the point raised by Mr Swoboda concerning the Balkans. I fully agree: we did not spend a great deal of time talking about the Balkans, but our policy of association and stabilisation processes and ongoing relations and assistance is part of a strategy for achieving a long-term goal precisely of making the Balkans part of the Union too. It will take time and, above all, the process will differ from country to country – close monitoring of these countries has shown that some move faster than others – but the Balkans are becoming increasingly our responsibility, and we are aware of this and taking appropriate action.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, I have nothing to add, apart from a consideration which I feel I must point out to the House. We based our report on practical criteria. In this respect, the change in government does not introduce any new factors because we will have to see what practical measures it takes to implement the Copenhagen criteria. The Commission report is very specific and very clear on this point and the position we take must therefore be consistent with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no comment to make on the subject of Kaliningrad, other than to say that we will respect the position of Lithuania and its rights as a new Member of the Union. All our work, including the difficult negotiations, has taken such a long time precisely because of the need to respect these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Chechnya has been mentioned by a large number of speakers today. Although Chechnya is not part of the subject of this debate, I do feel that the question is closely related to the issues we are discussing. The Commission vehemently and unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts, starting with the tragic incident of the hostages in the Moscow theatre. It affirms equally explicitly that the fight against terrorism cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights. This applies to Chechnya, where our human rights agencies working <span class="italic">in situ</span> are constantly reporting incidents of failure to respect human rights and violation of human rights by both Russian military operators and Chechen rebels. In my view, the best way to prevent further violation of human rights is to pursue the investigations currently being performed by the Russian military and civil prosecutors who have undertaken to carry out these inquiries. There is also a Russian undertaking to take certain steps to improve human rights in Chechnya, which include reducing the number of troops present, putting an end to what are known as round-ups and, as I said before, allowing prosecutors to observe military operations. There have been countless statements made to this effect and we must ensure that this, at least, does happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a further matter in which the Commission is directly involved and that is the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of that country, who have to endure the suffering and problems caused by the difficult living conditions. Furthermore, two NGO workers – one European and one local – who were taken prisoner some weeks ago, have still not been released. We are pushing for urgent resolution of this matter. Lastly, we must constantly and insistently make it clear that a political solution is the only way to resolve the Chechen question. This is our message, the stance we will adopt at the bilateral meeting with the Russian authorities in Brussels. As I said before, political dialogue is the only way forward. Otherwise, there will be no end to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the CAP, which has been mentioned a number of times with comments being made which are not consistent with what was decided at Brussels. After Brussels, the reform of the CAP is still on the table. Moreover, Commissioner Fischler is going to take part in a debate on the matter in this very Chamber. I am not going to go into details but I can assure you that the Commission is working long and hard on pursuing its recent proposal.</p>
