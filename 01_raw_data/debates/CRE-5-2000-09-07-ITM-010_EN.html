However, there are still serious worries about the future of Fiji.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the use of violence by certain ethnic groupings to impose their rule on other communities is unacceptable. Secondly, a democratic government must be re-established. The present interim government has no democratic basis. There should be a clear blue-print for full restoration of democratic principles and practices. The 1997 Constitution, which lays down the principle of equal rights for all Fijian citizens, must be reinstated. This process should be finalised very quickly. The time-frame currently being proposed, two or three years, is far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved. Multiracial cooperation and harmony must become a reality. This might require international mediation. If we are to be realistic, we must support every possible step on the way to stability without losing sight of the scenario I have just outlined. The international community and the donors of aid to Fiji agree on these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the EU is concerned, the Council has informed the Fijians of its request to begin consultations under Article 366 of the Lomé Convention, which calls for a thorough examination of the situation on the basis of information to be supplied by the Fijians. Further input will be provided by the report of an ACP ministerial fact-finding mission to Fiji which took place in mid-August and which was led by the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea. Furthermore, the Commission received first-hand information from the legitimate Prime Minister, Mr Chaudhry on 31 August.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at the beginning of the consultations. Measures under Article 366 will be taken if the consultations fail to produce an acceptable solution for both sides in the discussions. All that can be said at present is that the measures, if any, should not harm the poor and those already suffering from the severe economic crisis triggered by the events. Poverty-related projects should, consequently, continue. In conclusion, I hope that the coordinated effort of the international donor community will have the desired effect on the current government in Fiji.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we achieve our aim of restoring democratic principles and a government chosen in fair and equal elections within less than two years, this will be only a first step for the solution of the Fijian problem. A strong long-term effort is required from all parties and, in the first instance, from the Fijian Government and the communities, to work on the entrenched prejudices and anxieties so that racial cooperation and harmony can be restored and become a reality in Fiji. This is absolutely essential and there are no alternatives to that reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, they are for real. What is more, Fiji is an ACP country which enjoys considerable benefits thanks to the sugar protocol with the European Union. It is almost ironic that the new partnership deal, which considers democracy to be of paramount importance, was signed in Fiji at a time when that country was hit by a coup d’état. It illustrates, once again, how fragile democracy is, even in regions where it seemed to be an established value.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Fiji story is more complicated than that. There is a delicate balance of power between the indigenous population and the population of Indian origin, who make up 44% of the population. The army plays a dubious role. The attacks on Indian properties could apparently take place undisturbed and without any intervention by the body of officials responsible for order. In fact, certain elements within the army openly chose the side of the army taking part in the coup. There are the recent revelations about the role of Mr Speight in the lucrative timber industry, which put the whole matter in a completely new light. According to recent information, he was apparently discharged as chairman of the state enterprise which manages mahogany plantations, and earlier in the year, he was in danger of missing out on a major contract for the development of hardwood. All this seems to suggest that personal and economic, rather than political, interests were behind the coup. Be that as it may, Speight’s undemocratic behaviour has plunged a whole country into a deep political and economic crisis. Tourism, which represented one third of the gross domestic product, has dropped to less than one fifth. Ethnic tension is once again mounting. Thousands of inhabitants of Indian origin are still on the run, and the events in Fiji are also prejudicing the promising dynamic in the region which was to culminate in the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement. The European Parliament which, in its agreements with the ACP partners, makes strict demands regarding democracy and human rights, can and must condemn such a course of events. We need to continue to demand that the safety of all citizens be guaranteed and that any form of ethnic division and provocation be penalised. Speight should not be let off the hook. Above all, we must work towards the return of true democracy within the meaning of the 1997 Constitution, which guarantees equal rights to all inhabitants of Fiji, and it is true that elections must be called as soon as possible. A three-year transitional period is not acceptable. If the interim government fails to restore democratic order within a reasonable period of time, sanctions must be considered, preferably ‘smart’<span class="italic"> </span>sanctions, and structural aid must be suspended. Consultations on this matter will be starting in September. I do hope that the Commission will stick to its principles and will not succumb to political or economic pressure. As we are about to embark on a new major partnership agreement between Europe and its partners in the ACP, it is of paramount importance not to create a precedent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am not as convinced as he is that the violence is actually over in Fiji. I had the opportunity last week, along with a number of colleagues from various parties and groups here, to meet with Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry who reported to us that violence against the Indo-Fijians is still continuing in Fiji. Secondly, I disagree that there is a fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji. It seems to me, if one looks at the origin of the coup d'état, that one should follow the money rather than the ethnic relations. I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the Lomé Convention has been invoked.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look back at the history of what has happened in Fiji, we see a sweeping electoral victory by the Fijian Labour Party in the May 1999 General Election when they won, with their supporting parties, 58 out of the 71 seats, ousting the incumbent right-wing government. Following that, there has been a systematic attempt to destabilise the new government led by elements of the former governing party and extreme nationalist gangs under the flimsy pretext of protecting indigenous interests. It is interesting that, although Mahendra Chaudhry is an Indo-Fijian, twelve out of the 18 members of his cabinet are, as it were, indigenous Fijians and a majority of indigenous Fijian MPs actually supported the Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The destabilisation operation was financed by sections of private enterprise, frightened by the government's radical programme of social reform and poverty alleviation and by its close association with the trade union movement. This financing was led by corporate groups bidding for the right to exploit mahogany and native hardwood forestry.</p>
<p class="contents">The police and the military singularly failed to protect and defend the government. Alongside George Speight and his gang, when the people's coalition government were taken hostage on 19 May, were members of the armed forces' counter-revolutionary warfare unit. What has happened in Fiji is nothing less than a coup d'état by the military industrial complex. In fact, it is another Chile written small.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the 1997 Constitution has been ripped up. A government has been imposed in power by the military that it is effectively controlled by those supporting the coup and the military is trying to offload the blame by prosecuting one small section of those involved, namely the gang around George Speight</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers must back the proposals by the Labour led people's coalition for reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution and, in the spirit of national conciliation, for the formation of a grand coalition for the government in Fiji. Unless this is achieved, unless the slide towards a form of apartheid in Fiji, where Indo-Fijians who comprise nearly half the population are rapidly becoming second-class citizens, driven from their homes and jobs, is stopped, then we should demand support for sanctions against the current government.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support the moves by Premier Helen Clark from New Zealand for a concerted action at bilateral, regional and global levels, which should include, as Mr Van Hecke said, ‘smart’ sanctions targeted at those involved in the coups, denying them the freedom to travel, freezing foreign assets and threatening them when they are apprehended with the consequences of the UN Hostage Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Fiji should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events. Third, there should be a denial of all economic and military assistance to and through the present government. The issue of Fiji is important, not only in its own right, but because it will set a precedent as to whether semi-clandestine coups-in-waiting along similar lines will see the light of day and whether Europe and the rest of the developed world is prepared to tackle the issue of indigenous rights – the Third World's variant of the racism that is threatening us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the coup in Fiji in May of this year was not the first one. It was preceded by one in 1987 which resulted in exclusion from the Commonwealth. This does lead me to believe that the tension, possibly ethnic in origin, must go far deeper than we might like to think. Then too, tension between the indigenous people of Fiji and Indo-Fijians was at the root of the problem and, needless to say, with Indo-Fijians accounting for 44% of the population and the indigenous people accounting for 64%, two peoples of more or less the same size are involved. I can imagine that the removal of prejudice, as you referred to earlier Commissioner, is not a matter of course in such situations. Moreover, unemployment promotes tension, and the legally elected government was driven out by the military coup. What concerns me more than anything is that this conflict could spread to other islands with similar problems and similar tensions. This is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in mind and to which reference has already been made: the establishment of a great Pacific Regional Trade Agreement between 14 nations. If we are not careful, this will be the first major conflict in the Pacific and this may well affect the situation in the region for a few decades to come.</p>
<p class="contents">All this makes me wonder whether this coup is merely the thin end of the wedge. It also makes me wonder what the European Union’s prevention policy actually consists of. What can be done in order to put such a country back on the road towards being a democratic, constitutional state, no longer in a crisis situation and with the guilty parties brought to justice, as has been requested with good reason? We should also press for the safety of all citizens – this seems basic to me, especially in a country where thousands of people are on the run in their own country – as well as for a parliament which should be re-convened this autumn, and for a democratically elected government. Some of our motions for resolution also include the requirement that the opposition should take part in the government. This, of course, presupposes an agreement, which has not been concluded since the multi-racial constitution of 1997, which was seemingly approved by everyone at the time but which cannot, however, be applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is Fiji’s key trading partner and provider of aid. How can we translate this role into effective peace mediation? Could we not appoint a genuine mediator or mediating body in consultation with the UN and the Commonwealth? The Kotonu conventions provide for a partnership for development and peace, and the Lomé conventions also provide for procedures, especially Article 366, which has already been referred to. These procedures should be applied with due care, intelligence and maturity. We invite the Commission to come back before the end of the year to report on the developments in Fiji and the region as a whole and on the efforts which the European Union has made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the events of the past few months in Fiji are not an isolated incident. They are more than the sum-total of a crazed, racist businessman, a disloyal army, the interests of timber merchants, and politicians who accept that the democratically enacted constitution has been invalidated. The events have everything to do with the relationship between people and state in general and with the history of Fiji and the composition of its population in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">European colonialism caused workers from other parts of the then British colonial empire to move to Fiji, as a result of which the 44% of people of Indian origin have now started to form a near-majority of the population. The original Fijian population has never had a say in the matter but has meanwhile been faced with the reality that the composition of the population has changed beyond recognition. Descendants of those newcomers rightly feel that they are a part of the established population of the group of islands, with equal rights, whilst a large section of the original population still struggles to come to terms with this new status quo. The situation is in many ways comparable to that in Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad and South Africa. Indeed, European colonialism brought peoples of very different origins together in those regions too. The peoples involved had nothing in common in terms of language, culture and religion and there are also striking differences in their appearance. They very often live as closed groups juxtaposed to one another within the same territory, but largely in separate settlements and urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In these countries, there have often been harsh clashes between these peoples. Sometimes, part of such a group believes it is superior, but often the clashes are about the ruthless protection of interests and the distribution of goods in short supply among competing groups. These competitors need the same land, the same jobs and the same houses, whilst everything is in short supply. In South Africa, this situation even led to an atrocious system of inequality and oppression, referred to as apartheid.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the people of such countries have come to the conclusion that all people are equal and that they have no choice other than to join forces. But this does not take away the fact that closed groups continue to live side by side without real integration. Politicians and adventurers who wish to set peoples against each other still have plenty of scope. That is the key difference compared with the current states in Europe. The latter are generally united with one people, one common history, one language and more or less one culture. This is true of old countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal but is also true of relatively new countries such as Poland, Italy, Germany and Romania or of very new ones, including the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Lithuania. Precisely because these countries are incontrovertibly linked to the people who live there as a large majority, they can be open to minorities and newcomers and maintain their democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">But in European countries, too, there are unpleasant recollections of former newcomers who came as soldiers, robbers and privileged groups of businessmen and who put the people at a disadvantage. Very often, people these days would prefer to see the descendants of these newcomers leave their country or else wish that they had completely adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">From our European perspective, we recognise the right of the Israeli and Palestinian states to exist side by side, as was illustrated once again very clearly this week during the remarkable visit of the presidents of both parliaments. It is impossible to live there in peace in one state but people can quite easily co-exist as good neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair enough, Europe is to blame and should help solve the problems. But that does not take away the fact that the situation which has arisen in Fiji is completely unacceptable. The equal rights of the large Indian minority, the constitution and parliamentary democracy must be restored. Those who use racism to their advantage must be punished and at least be excluded from political power, the refugees must be able to return home, and violence must come to an end. The multi-racial constitution of 1997, which came about following a previous coup d’état after lengthy negotiations, must be restored without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have friends and acquaintances there and have been there. When I spoke to the politicians the last time I was there three or four years ago the one thing they were all pleased about was the new constitution which had taken four years to put together, and when I saw the events of recent times my heart sank because I knew the consequences for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like clarification from you, Commissioner. From what you said, I assume you are saying no sanctions, that it is a matter of wait and see and giving them time to sort themselves out before we take any action. I would like clarity on that point. I do not want to walk away from here just assuming that; it would be helpful if you could be more explicit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ford has called for Fiji to be banned from all sporting events. My sport happens to be a minority sport – rugby league football – and in October or November the World Cup will be taking place in the UK and in France. Fiji will have a squad there as part of the World Cup. The Australian Government wants them banned. The Australian Government thinks that Fiji should not take part in this competition. If you speak to the players, whether they be Asian, Polynesian or Melanesian, they will say they want to play, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">My specific question to you, Commissioner, is would the Commission advocate sporting bans at this time or not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very useful exercise in analysing the extent of our principles and whether or not there are human activities that should be quite independent. Sport today is not only sport, it is also business. For that reason the world of sport has created more difficulties for itself than used to be the case in more innocent times.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am informed, unlike the line you say they are following with rugby, the Australians, when it comes to participation in the Olympic Games are maintaining a clear distinction between politics and sport. We have no specific view in the Commission as to one event or another. At this moment we are engaging in the dialogue of the Lomé Convention, so at this stage we have not drawn conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to your more general question, there may very well be broad sanctions, but it depends on the outcome of the dialogue. This dialogue is well-organised and systematic based on the beauty of our relationship with ACP countries. It is not just a donor-recipient relationship. We have the background of a system to work from. This system is put to work in the given situation. The options are open. We have both the stick and the carrot. We are actively drawing into this debate the regional ACP partners and giving the authorities in the country in question a say in the discussion. But it is an extremely critical situation. It contains all the dilemmas that situations like this normally present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to find out what the right thing to do is but we are doing everything to mobilise pressure for a rapid, irreversible return to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the reply to Mrs Maes. We do have a very important role as a trading partner and donor in Fiji and this creates a serious framework for the present discussion with the people in power in Fiji.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards coming back to the Parliament, I would say that I am always of course willing to go to the Development Committee and discuss any issue. I would certainly like to have an opportunity to go more into detail before the end of the year if this is something the committee would welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I can fully concur with everything Mr Ford said. It is really tragic what is happening. Also, as others said, the risk of a negative spillover in the region should also be taken into consideration when we are deciding what our measures should be.</p>
<p class="contents">One important measure that was taken – and this is a comment for Mr Van Hecke – was to call off the signing ceremony planned for Fiji. So it is not the Suva Agreement that will govern our future relationship with the ACP states. We went to Benin instead of Fiji in the summer and that, in fact, was a strong measure from both the EU side and the ACP side that it was taken as a natural thing that we could not sign the new agreement in Fiji. So, in political terms we have already sent a strong message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
