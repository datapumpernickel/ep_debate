<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bushill-Matthews (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – This is Parliament's second report on the growth and employment initiative which is a multiannual programme. But it is also, perhaps unusually, the second one this calendar year and the reason for this is that the 1999 report was delayed until January of this year in essence because the Commission had been somewhat sluggish – a point I recollect I observed in my speech in January. This year, I am delighted to say that the Commission has produced a very thorough and generally much better report and I would like to thank them for the cooperation they have shown.</p>
<p class="contents">Ironically, the timing has been more of a problem this time around with Parliament and that is partly because the Industry Committee decided that it wanted to produce an opinion and wrote to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and asked if the vote in committee could be deferred. The vote was deferred and then the Committee on Industry decided it did not want to produce an opinion after all. But these things happen. Anyway, I would like to thank colleagues in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their amendments which have generally improved the report substantially. I would like to thank the Economic Committee for their opinion which the committee fully supported and which is utterly embraced within the body of the report, and I would also like to thank the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for adopting this report unanimously a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament clearly hopes that its views as expressed in this report when voted on tomorrow will be of genuine help to the Commission and the EIF in determining any programme changes for the coming year, in which case the report each year needs to be presented annually in good time well ahead of the year to come so that it can influence what happens in the year to come. The challenge for everybody in the year 2002 is therefore to present the report in the November plenary rather than in the December plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can help, as I hope they will, by speeding up the inter-service consultation which still seems to be a rather dozy process. I have it on good authority that the Commission's own report rested in certain DGs in-trays for several weeks before being lifted out so progress can be made there. It can also help by sharing with Parliament the quarterly information from the EIF and I thank the Commission for agreeing publicly in the Employment Committee to do this. This will be very helpful, but Parliament can certainly help in sharpening up its own act in terms of getting the timetable much sprucer next time around.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I would just like to highlight three points from the report: paragraph 13 where we would like to see in next year the Commission report much more concrete evidence of the employment gains that this multiannual programme has produced, not because we doubt what those employment gains might be, but we would like to see some hard data next time around. On paragraph 14, there are a number of references to other stages in the development of SMEs in their business cycle. We would like attention to be paid to this too. Finally, to go back to the earlier part of the report, in Recital F, where a deliberate comparison is made with the United States, because there, less regulation allows for a much more entrepreneurial spirit. In the EU we believe that we have to get a much more similar mindset to America in the way in which we approach SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with great interest the Minutes of the Industry Council meeting on 4 and 5 December, which proudly proclaimed real progress under the Belgian presidency towards "better practices geared towards elimination of red tape". If this is true it is most welcome. I want to believe it. I would love to see the evidence. Certainly we all have to do our best to make it true.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs currently account for two-thirds of all workers – the majority of all workers employed in the European Union. But European employment laws are substantially shaped by the social partners who represent the big employers and the big trade unions but the minority of the workers. We all need to recognise that SMEs are the biggest employers overall, that SMEs are the biggest engine of growth for the European economies. It is not enough just to say that we have looked after SMEs, that we have the employment and growth initiative. It is a great help but we have to do much more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to present briefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium-sized enterprises are the economic backbone of European society. SMEs find access to finance ever more difficult, and a look at the agreements that Basle II will bring with it leads us to assume that this finance will become even more problematic. New methods of finance, such as venture capital, initial public offers, or all the other things currently being tried out or referred to, certainly represent a feasible way ahead, and one to which we in Europe will have to give thought, but not one to be used similarly by all SMEs. It is for that reason that I am glad that the Commission is taking up this issue on Europe's behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, on the basis of my practical experience and of my discussions with many owners of SMEs, to tell the Commission of my principal concern, which is that future promotion of SMEs should also be tailored to their needs. Many owners of SMEs have no idea, or it is very hard for them to find out, where any kind of support at a European level is to be had. Support is meant to be transparent. Then I often hear complaints that support at a European level is very complicated, that compliance with the requirements imposed on SMEs is very difficult and that this often made the whole thing very expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, all this should also be calculable in good time. Very lengthy application procedures stretched over many years result in small entrepreneurs quite simply running out of breath and not making it through to the final stages of the process. This means that everything possible needs to be done by the Commission to ensure that support for SMEs meets the needs of applicants from the target group, that is, the owners of the enterprises themselves. At a European level, though, we can ease the burden on SMEs or do justice to them not only by offering finance, but we should also consider how we might remove the burden from them by avoiding additional bureaucracy and regulation, which weigh down on them more and more. I believe it would be highly appropriate to put in place a screening procedure in the Enterprise Directorate-General which would make it possible to lodge a veto in good time, permitting the passage of regulations beneficial and appropriate to SMEs and excluding those detrimental to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The promotion of SMEs contributes to greater investment and innovation, and to the creation of new philosophies of enterprise. A multiannual programme was started to benefit an initiative towards growth and employment. Parliament approved a budget of EUR 450 million. SMEs are an engine for jobs in Europe. Seventy per cent of all workers are employed by them, and over 80% of all apprentices trained by them. In order to give them a better chance in the market, however, more financial and fiscal burdens have to be taken off their backs. They need improved access to risk capital. The European Investment Bank should apply its funds not only to the knowledge-based enterprises in the multimedia and biotechnology sectors, but also to cutting-edge technologies in the environmental and energy sectors and to innovative service-providers in craftsmanship, trade and tourism. Interest-rate subsidies paid out amount to over EUR 93 million rather than the EUR 100 million that had been envisaged, yet, all the same, 54 000 new jobs were created where 33 000 had been expected. If that is not a success...</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent report that Mr Bushill-Matthews has produced meets with full support from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and my committee was unanimously in favour of it. I echo his criticism that the report reached the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs far too late. Obviously there were too many services dealing with it. Parliament can, though, only take responsibility and perform its supervisory function if information is available in good time. Future reports will have to concentrate on aspects that make effective analysis possible. What about the quality of jobs in innovative fields? How is sustainability ensured? How many women – who, at the end of the day, are a significant element in the European employment strategy – are involved? The Commission's report is encouraging, this criticism notwithstanding, providing, as it does, evidence that it is worth investing in these forward-looking sectors, and that is entirely in the employees' interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report. He has made every effort to add this report to the agenda at the earliest opportunity and, as he has already indicated, he is not to blame for the fact that that is not the case. Even the Commission has made more of an effort to ensure that that is done in time, and moreover, the content of the report presented by the Commission is more substantial than when we discussed it the first time round, because we have since gained more experience with the Growth and Employment Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is about this Growth and Employment Initiative and about the three financial instruments which have been developed with this initiative in mind, namely the ETF start-up facility, the JEV programme and the SME Guarantee Facility. Just like last year, on behalf of my group, I should like to underline the social dimension in this respect. This initiative is the brain child of the European Parliament that was developed in the wake of the Luxembourg Summit in 1997, and right from the outset, it was made very clear at the time that the initiatives should not only focus on this highly advanced technological sector, but should also embrace the social sector, and I am of the opinion that we cannot repeat this enough.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one point where I cannot completely follow the rapporteur in this report, and that concerns recital F which he quotes. He refers to the United States of America in this respect. More investments are made in new initiatives over there, and the decision to set up one’s own business is made more easily. I acknowledge that this is the case, but I disagree with his analysis that the reason for this would be the US’s milder regulatory climate. In my view, this is much more related to the whole culture of entrepreneurship, the fact that people over there are used to taking initiatives, that it is not of such major concern to fail once, to go bankrupt once and start again. In my opinion, cultural factors of this kind play a much more significant role than simply the regulatory climate. This remark is not really appropriate, in my view. I hope that we can find a compromise on that score at tomorrow’s vote, for it would be unfortunate if this report were not adopted unanimously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the criticisms made of the Commission's report and many of the points made in relation to support that SMEs need, both by the rapporteur and by other speakers here tonight. But the report does not deal adequately with the crucial issue of whether jobs were actually created by these financial instruments. The amendment by my group makes explicit reference to this. The stated intention of the SME guarantee facility is to stimulate job creation by supporting the investment activities of SMEs within the EU through increased availability of loan finance.</p>
<p class="contents">The estimate for job creation is an average 1.3 new jobs per SME over 2 years which is described as substantial. But we do not have a cost/benefit analysis and enough concrete information. I would ask colleagues to support this report but also to support the amendment which makes this point clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is a plea to grant greater financial assistance to small- and medium-sized businesses. I am even more opposed to the idea of giving public money to private businesses since large financial and industrial corporations are often lurking behind the all-encompassing SME cause.</p>
<p class="contents">It would never strike Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his fervent support of the so-called free market, to propose financial assistance for workers who have been made redundant by the very same industrial and financial corporations or their counterparts. On the contrary, the rapporteur brings out the begging bowl without compunction, so that public money can be shifted, through the SME Guarantee facility or pre-start financing, into the coffers of large corporations so that it ends up swelling the private wealth of shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">To prove that Member States and the European institutions are no strangers to a bit of hypocrisy, this increased financial assistance is proposed in the name of job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall of course vote against this report. Public money should go to public services, to health, education, and public transport, which could and should create many more useful jobs for everyone than these start-ups, which swallow up money without showing how they are of use to society.</p>
<p class="contents">The health sector has been reduced to collecting public money in order to contend with some diseases. I would like to see employers come round to collect public money. It is not up to Parliament to give taxpayers’ money to help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, we received with great interest the report by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the second annual report on growth and employment initiatives. I very much appreciate the spirit of cooperation with the rapporteur and the favourable comments made on the annual report. In particular, I know that the committee's report – and I quote: "welcomes generally the content and analysis within the thorough and more comprehensive 2000 report and commends the Commission and the EIF where progress has been made".</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews and have grouped my comments under three headings: provision of information to Parliament and its timing, geographical coverage and an updating of the instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly on the provision of information. All the completion of the formal Commission procedures for the adoption of such a report may appear too long and, frankly, sometimes it is. The Commission has helped the rapporteur by providing an advance copy of the report before publication. We intend to continue this practice of keeping the rapporteur informed prior to the completion of the formal Commission procedure. We also explored to what extent we can share with the rapporteur the quarterly information received from the EIF without the need for a formal Commission procedure. It should be noted that this quarterly information is mainly used for operational purposes. It is to ensure appropriate monitoring of the programmes by the Commission services and cannot be relied upon to provide the same degree of accuracy and detail expected by the annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on geographical coverage. The geographical distribution of the project signed under both the ETF start-up and the SME guarantee programmes varies considerably. The difficulties of implementing ETF start-up in all countries of the Union stems from the different stage of development of the venture capital market in various countries, coupled with the requirement that ETF start-up only invests <span class="italic">pari passu </span>with at least 50% of capital provided by the private sector. In those countries where little venture capital activity exists it is difficult, if not impossible, to meet the second condition. In the meantime the take-up of the facility has successfully continued with another foreign investment signed and three more being processed, all together corresponding to a geographical coverage of eleven countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see from our annual report the distribution for SME guarantee is most satisfactory. The initial high take-up in Germany and France was attributable to the existence of well-developed national guarantee programmes in those two countries which were able to take advantage rapidly of this facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the instruments. The three instruments of the growth and employment initiative have been integrated into the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship and in particular SMES 2001-2005. A change in market conditions prompted the Commission to suggest a refocusing of ETF start-up further upstream: seed, early stage and incubators. Similarly, it led the Commission to propose diversification in the SME guarantee portfolios, for instance towards microloans in favour of the smallest enterprises and ICT loans that allow small enterprises to take advantage of the potential of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the simplification of joint European ventures, our legal and budget experts have come to the conclusion that the Council decision on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship does not allow simplification in significant terms. To achieve this, a new Council decision would be required and such a decision would also need a new budget appropriation. Before submitting an appropriate proposal to the Council on which Parliament would be consulted, the Commission services are working on a full assessment of a joint European venture.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this assessment, the competent Commission services may submit a proposal to reduce considerably the life of the joint European venture programme and so that the whole budget will not be used. But I and my services will keep you informed accordingly of any developments in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
