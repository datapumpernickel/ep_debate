<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markus Ferber (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might observe at the outset that it is stated in the report we are about to discuss, and on which we will be voting tomorrow, that we are giving discharge to the President of Parliament, and so I think it highly regrettable that the President of this House is not present for our deliberations today. I would like to point out that he is under a particular obligation to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we had in fact completed the discharge procedure for this House’s 2004 budget back in April, careful reading of the local paper here in Strasbourg brought to light something that, in terms of its drama, certainly takes some beating.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it unacceptable that, even though the House authorities were informed by the city of Strasbourg as long ago as November 2005 that the latter still had to conduct negotiations in respect of the two buildings – known as IPE 1 and IPE 2 – with a Dutch pension fund, both the House authorities and the Bureau pressed on with the purchase negotiations and it was only our own initiative that prevented the deal going through. Moreover, what we have managed to find out from investigating this – and it is on this that I would like to concentrate in the little time remaining to me – makes for a pretty interesting tale.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1979, when direct elections were introduced, the European Parliament decided that it needed office space. There can be no objection to that. It asked the city of Strasbourg to make such space available – and there is nothing objectionable about that either. The city of Strasbourg decided that it could not afford to do that itself, so it commissioned a third party – the Dutch pension fund to which I have referred – to build an office block. What resulted from this was a sub-letting arrangement, with us ending up paying the city of Strasbourg between EUR 30 and EUR 60 million – depending on which study one consults – more in rent than it, in turn, was paying to the pension fund, even though this House’s Committee on Budgets and the Quaestors had, in 1980, insisted that no more be paid from then on to the city of Strasbourg that it itself was paying to the pension fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this House’s Bureau that, in 1983, reviewed the acceptability of the rent charged and devised a new system of calculation based on comparability, on which basis the rent was calculated anew, and, since it was during the 1980s that inflation in France was at its height, the city of Strasbourg wanted the lease index-linked, albeit without any limit of time.</p>
<p class="contents">This has led us, in the report which I have the honour of presenting today, to two basic conclusions. The first is that, with effect from 1983 at the latest, the authorities charged with the management of this wonderful building, the European Parliament, stopped doing anything about the leases that they had concluded with the city of Strasbourg. That is unacceptable, for, to give a quite specific example, one consequence of the introduction of the euro is that index-linking has become meaningless. The second conclusion – and this is something I want to spell out plainly – is that the city of Strasbourg, which provides the European Parliament with a home, has given no kind of example of good and trusting cooperation between the institution and the city.</p>
<p class="contents">All our audits have established that there has been no corruption, no fraud, no mismanagement, no misappropriation of funds. I very much regret the absence of the honourable Member who has been known to sit here wearing a gas mask and claiming that the place stank of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not for us to judge whether or not it was wise that the European treaties should lay down where the seat of Parliament was to be. There is a lady Member who lives in Brussels and no doubt has a miserable time of it in the youth hostel when she comes to Strasbourg; I also very much regret her absence, not to mention the fact that she has contributed nothing by way of input to this report. What we were required to do was to go through what had happened in the past, and that is what we have done. My warm thanks go to all the Members who have played their part in this. We were not, however, called upon to decide where the European Parliament’s seat should be, which is a matter for the infinite wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, and I am sure we all know that the issue is safe in their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, many thanks from me to all who have had a hand in this, combined with sadness that there were so many who sought to turn this into a media campaign without, however, taking any part in the real work that was done by the working party and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">All these observations notwithstanding, and with suggestions for the future, we are giving discharge for 2004. We will, however, be discussing further developments in future reports as and when this proves necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main conclusion of the investigation into the allegations on the two Strasbourg buildings is that there is no indication of illegality. In this sense, therefore, the allegations were unfounded. However, a number of findings have emerged that, although not illegal, should be stressed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that there was indeed an excessive payment of rent in the order of between EUR 32 million and as much as EUR 60 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the City of Strasbourg acted in breach of trust when it did things which it knew would never have been acceptable to Parliament, such as keeping part of the rent payments and negotiating a cut of EUR 29 million from the purchase price.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the administration of the European Parliament was also found to be lacking, because over a long period of 30 years it failed in its duty of diligence to ensure that the rent that was paid to Strasbourg for the buildings was not excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament <span class="italic">itself</span> was not united on this issue, for how else can one explain the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of the allegations well over a month after the Bureau of Parliament itself? How else can one explain that, even as our investigation was taking place, our Bureau continued to negotiate the purchase of the buildings, thereby undermining the political authority of the investigation itself?</p>

I only wish to say that I support the conclusions of the Ferber report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report argues that there is in fact a breach of faith between the City of Strasbourg and this institution. This is something I can wholeheartedly support. Two public institutions dealing with public money should behave in a way that is not only legally just but also ethically and morally acceptable. After having participated in this working party, I find that in the tripartite negotiations one party has consistently acted according to those ethically just principles, and one party, namely the City of Strasbourg, has not.</p>
<p class="contents">I have become known in my short time in this Parliament as one of the leaders of the anti-Strasbourg campaign. I am not used to using words like ‘anti-’ because basically I do not like the way it rings. I have tried my utmost to avoid mixing up the discussions on Parliament’s seat with the discussions on whether tax money has been well spent. I would like to put it to Parliament today that the only people who have consistently mixed up these two debates have been, firstly, the Mayor of Strasbourg, who, when she addressed us during her hearing, reminded us that having such a debate was in fact quite dangerous because the Alsace region has a very symbolic meaning. I am absolutely convinced that this is true and I totally agree.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to use this short time in the sitting today to ask the City of Strasbourg – if what it says is really true and if it really believes that this is a region that deserves to be honoured – why is it that since 1979 it has consistently acted in a way that, to put it mildly, is inconsistent with that aim?</p>
<p class="contents">These are two public institutions that are trying to do the best for their citizens. I stand here because I wish to ensure that the money that Dutch citizens pay into the account of the European Union is well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to point out that, according to the auditors’ report, it has not been well spent and that this has in fact been, to put it mildly, ...</p>

If it had not been for a newspaper article that appeared just before the discharge date, drawing attention to the compensation element involved in the purchase of two new buildings in Strasbourg, we probably would have simply granted discharge in April. Once the report was out in the open, the administration reacted entirely appropriately by cancelling the purchase of those two buildings. I also have to say that the Committee on Budgets reacted very adequately by immediately setting up an internal committee of inquiry to examine all aspects of the case. I can only say that in this process and in that committee of inquiry, Mr Ferber has played a star role, and all credit to him for that. The committee of inquiry has also done a good job within a short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion that I have drawn, like others – so at the risk of going over old ground – is that there was a relationship of trust between two public institutions, between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament which, as a result of this issue, has been dealt a huge blow. The fact that two public institutions make profits on each other’s backs is inexcusable, since it is still taxpayers’ money that is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally, however, everything is watertight, and so there is little we can recoup from it. In my view, the Ferber report is right to conclude that the purchase of buildings, subject to a number of conditions – provided that the price is right and we purchase land and buildings at the same time – is still the best option for the taxpayer. I subscribe to that view and I think that that is set to happen shortly. I should also like to point out that this purchase of the building is completely unrelated to the issue of seats. As Mr Ferber has already said, a decision by Heads of Government could change this. Parliament may have its own view, but is not in a position to change anything. What matters are the taxpayers’ interests. I believe that if the price is right, in the long run, and even in the relatively short term, it would be cheaper than carrying on paying rent.</p>
<p class="contents">A discharge is always about the past. Apart from the buildings, the report also contains a whole list of interesting things with recommendations for the future. It contains useful recommendations about the contracts that have to be given to parliamentary assistants, as well as about the new opportunities which communications technologies offer us, with which I, myself, endeavour to get to grips on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the general conclusions, I can confirm that my group broadly endorses Mr Ferber’s views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turning to the buildings policy first, about which all speakers have had something to say, we now have before us a second report as a result of that article in the press. A special working party was set up, in which, I believe, we all worked very hard and very well together, and in which we tried to give Mr Ferber maximum support.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions are therefore identical across the board, and most Members have quoted them. We have been unable to identify any unlawful actions or corruption, but what we do know is that, over the past 20 years, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg quite a bit over the odds in rent, at least EUR 32 million and probably more, between EUR 42 and EUR 60 million. What is also unacceptable in my view is that the City of Strasbourg took the unilateral decision at one point to set aside EUR 11 million over that period for what it referred to as covering the risk of Parliament ever leaving its seat in this City.</p>
<p class="contents">These actions have dealt the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament a heavy blow, and it comes as no surprise, then, that this has cranked up the entire debate on Parliament’s seat. Whilst I am aware that this is not what this discharge report is about, I do think that Parliament should, in a recommendation to the Council, finally make up its mind and say whether it wants to continue to have its seat in this city or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the voluntary pension fund, which is another important aspect of Mr Ferber’s report. At the end of 2004, that fund suffered an insurance deficit to the tune of EUR 43 million, which, fortunately, dropped to EUR 28 million by the end of 2005. I should like to draw attention to my Amendment 5, which expressly states that Parliament itself can never be held liable for that deficit. It is a voluntary pension fund, one that is managed by the managers. As such, it is they who should be saddled with any deficits, not Parliament or the taxpayer. It is the managers who are responsible for the unethical, or incorrect, management of vast amounts of money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number of general comments concerning the control system and method of controlling implementation of the European Union’s budget come to mind in the context of the debate on discharge. I note with regret that the control system is rather general and superficial. Much is said about the reliability of ledgers, the number of errors, and the inadequacies of the control system. General remarks of this kind are repeated again and again, but in fact we do not have a full understanding of how the Union’s budget is implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as those concerning the Strasbourg buildings and before that the Eurostat affair and similar irregularities tend to be identified by the press. The control system is not helpful in this. The system needs to be rethought, to ensure it is more targeted and specific, and perhaps more akin to the system used by national control departments, which is more effective that the Union’s system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that the report describes this Parliament as ‘the democratic representative body in the EU’, let everyone be clear about just how little it deserves that description. We do not have debates in this institution, but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time without the opportunity for reply, hence the empty Chamber this evening. We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament. It acts as a fig leaf of democratic respectability, designed to mislead the people of Europe into thinking that they have some say in the management of the so-called European project.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no better example of this than the one million signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg. Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent, this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent. It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourg’s good faith, but the reality is that the City ...</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to make three points. First, congratulations to Mr Ferber on a wonderful report. It was a good idea to postpone the discharge report because of the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament. I fully support the content of the report and how it has been written. We dealt with that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, where the report was adopted with 25 votes in favour and only one against.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is about the blame game. It is true that both parties should be blamed: Parliament’s administration, which was perhaps a little naive, and the City of Strasbourg. There is no denying it. I agree with Mrs Mastenbroek and Mr Busuttil, who said that the City of Strasbourg has worked with us in bad faith. My confidence in the workings of this city has gone down.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns whether this report and the seat of the European Parliament are somehow linked. They are not, but at the same time it is a matter of how we use money. As in a marriage, it is important to talk about sensitive issues. I fully realise that this is a sensitive issue, but we must remember that it is not only the rent. The truth is that us coming here costs EUR 209 million of taxpayers’ money every year. That is a waste and I support the idea put forward in the ‘oneseat.eu’ campaign of having only one seat. Let us talk about it openly and try to find a solution, but separately from this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has become apparent is something of which one gets a sense in today’s sitting, namely that those who call for transparency often, at the end of the day, do not want the facts to come out, and – as the rapporteur has observed – it sometimes turns out that the facts are not quite so scandalous and not quite so extraordinary as what they would have liked to see in the newspapers, but the Committee on Budgetary Control, the rapporteur and the working party have acquired these documents by honest means, and they stand by them. I warmly congratulate them on the results that have come to light.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no great desire to go over again how appalling it was that so much was superimposed on this debate. Everyone has an opinion on Strasbourg, on Brussels, and on other things, and that makes it more difficult to do the job properly. I think it has been done rather well, and Mr Ferber’s report deserves our support.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the lessons we should learn from this? For a start, our own administrators, our own Bureau – of which, or so I believe, our current president is a member – were in possession of information that was not supplied to us at a time when Mr Ferber was already working on his report. That is not acceptable, and there is a need for change here. A different way of doing things must be required in future, or else we will have to look out for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, another lesson that I think we can learn from what Mr Ferber has written is that those who run this place should be required to review old contracts rather than waiting a thousand years for something else to crop up; that must not be allowed to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I think that all those who believe the current debate on building policy in Strasbourg could be combined with the ‘one seat’ debate, should first be sure in their own minds – which I am not – how things stand as regards this House’s policy on the other places where it meets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I deplore very strongly the fact that some colleagues in this Parliament have been casting slurs on other colleagues. Those who are casting the slurs are not present in this debate, and they have no evidence. It is a disgrace that they can go to the press and try to make their names by casting slurs on honourable Members of this Parliament. Let them produce the evidence before they go around saying such things.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no objection – and I have heard no objections – to our contributions to the pension scheme being deducted directly from our bank accounts. That is perfectly okay. But it should be borne in mind that Parliament would apparently have to recruit five extra full-time staff to do this, at an annual cost of EUR 400 000, in order to check that the right amounts have been transferred from each of the national bank accounts to the central pot. This is because some banks make bank charges to transfer the money and some do not, so that the amounts will vary. Furthermore, as there is no euro currency in 13 of our Member States, the monthly payments will also vary with fluctuations in the exchange rate of national currencies against the euro. All this involves very considerable expense, and we should keep cool heads and refrain from insults. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was a member of the Committee on Budgets and of the Conference of Presidents when the majority decided that the secretariat should be in Luxembourg and the meetings held by turns in Strasbourg and Brussels. When we had to choose between Strasbourg and Brussels, I voted in favour Strasbourg, so I am not addressing you from an anti-French perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">A million signatures have now been collected so that we might have a single seat. That is a striking expression of grass-roots opinion. We no longer want to find ourselves wasting taxpayers’ money and MEPs’ and employees’ time. We should therefore do what we can to respond to people’s criticism. When we set the calendar of sittings for 2008, we could decide to meet each Tuesday in the city where the Commission meets. We could be given a report on the day’s decisions and take all the votes requiring absolute majorities. In that way, the need for moving between the two centres would be drastically reduced. The ball would be in the prime ministers’ court, and they would be forced to establish a single place of work. That is something that we ourselves can do without violating the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also send out a signal by not purchasing new buildings now. I have tabled Amendment 9 in order to prevent or postpone their purchase. No one has had the imagination to picture the city of Strasbourg taking financial advantage of the European Parliament and European taxpayers. That idea was not put forward at any meeting I remember, and I will not accuse successive Secretary-Generals of having been negligent. It must be possible to expect public authorities to be honest and to show loyalty to one another. I understand, moreover, that Strasbourg has not contravened the law. That being the case, the law must be changed so that public authorities have a duty of information when they deal with each other. Here in Parliament, however, we are not obliged to purchase buildings from the city of Strasbourg. We have enough buildings, and now we must unite in demanding a single place of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I – being a mere acting member on the Committee on Budgetary Control – should also like to extend warm thanks to my group colleagues Mr Busuttil, Mr Stubb and Mrs Grässle, for the excellent working relationship we enjoyed with Mr Ferber, not least in the preparatory meetings of the working party of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ferber has tabled a critical report – critical, that is, about the buildings and about a number of services, whilst nevertheless being fair. It contains a number of sound recommendations for the way in which changes can be made for the better. For example, a discharge report must be used in order to control Parliament’s own housekeeping and budget more effectively. Needless to say, he devoted the necessary attention to the issue of the buildings, the problem we faced with the City of Strasbourg. He spelled out quite clearly, but also fairly, that at times Parliament, and not just the other parties in the conflict, is also to blame to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, whilst we Dutch Christian Democrats subscribe to the thrust of the Ferber report with regard to spending of the 2004 Parliament budget, as prepared and adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I should nevertheless like to make a few observations, which I see in isolation from the Ferber report, not least because he has done an excellent job with regard to Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, in the Committee on Budgets, we will be discussing a possible purchase. It is obvious that my party is opposed to this, not least on account of the fact that the discussion that is being held surrounding this topic – and I only need to refer to Mr Stubb's words, with which I am in agreement – should in actual fact be held prior to the purchase of buildings. Moreover, strictly speaking, Parliament cannot discuss this for another two years, during the 2006 discharge, which does not strike me as the right way of going about things.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a comment with regard to content about this purchase, namely about the possible presence of asbestos. The environmental aspects in this connection have not been adequately addressed. Whilst I should once again like to congratulate Mr Ferber, we cannot agree to the purchase of the building at this moment in time on account of the issues I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, we did not fully agree on some of his conclusions in committee and with his decision to revisit other subjects, which I believe have partly blurred the conclusions that were quite clear in the initial mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">This was going to be more of a management approval exercise for Parliament, but the information apparently given to the press by the City of Strasbourg about the profit that it had made on the price paid by Parliament – by using a kind of middleman contract which it never explained – threw up, or turned this exercise into, something much more interesting, from which we have gained some important experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The working party found that the practice was legal and was also customary in these financial engineering real-estate contracts, as was what, in my view, is the improper use of actual middlemen. It has to be acknowledged that the middlemen really earned their money.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, if there was too much trust on one side and a lack of good faith on the other, I believe that we, as Parliament, have learnt not to trust the good faith of other institutions so much. This whole exercise is therefore welcome if it can instil a greater awareness of the risks and dangers involved in real-estate transactions and if we can thereby – and I think that this is what we are aiming at – avoid such unpleasant surprises happening again in future, since they make it more difficult for Parliament to have the necessary trust in our own seats.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other two subjects that have again been included through the back door – pensions and Parliament’s seat – I confirm that I share the opinion expressed several times in this House that that is not the solution proposed by the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, of course, grateful to the Committee on Budgetary Control for having seen through its investigations aimed at shedding a little light on our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">While I, for my part, sincerely regret the clumsy way in which the City of Strasbourg has managed this issue, I have learnt two lessons from it. One concerns the running of our Parliament: as the rapporteur points out, in future, we must pay more attention to the legal status of our contracts, even when they are complex.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson is more fundamental and is political in nature. It still concerns the discharge, however. I hope that the adoption of the discharge will enable us to put a stop once and for all to the constant confused attempts aimed at turning attention back to the cost of the seat in Strasbourg, something that is determined by the Treaties and by the wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, as Mr Ferber pointed out. If we do not succeed in this, I propose two solutions: either we repatriate all of the institutions of the European Parliament, which is the democratic body <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, and we will have just one seat, as one of our fellow Members said; or, at the very least, we perform an audit to establish the cost of all of the European institutions spread across the whole of Europe, and we draw the lessons from that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rehashing of this business with the lease of the Strasbourg building – which has been going on for 28 years – puts me in a very reflective frame of mind.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President interrupted the speaker.)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It leaves me with doubts – doubts that will not go away – about the professionalism of the people who manage this House’s buildings and about how important value for money is to those who manage its finances. For 28 years, the House authorities did not check to see whether the leases were still good value – not even when the capital costs originally included had been written off, nor even when, in 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam laid down that Strasbourg would be our seat, for it was at this point, at the latest, that it became necessary to assess the risk involved.</p>
<p class="contents">For years on end, the rent paid was excessive, to the considerable detriment of this House and of the European taxpayer, amounting – as even the assessor appointed to act on behalf of the French Republic admitted – to something between EUR 28 and EUR 32 million at the least. Who is actually responsible for this? Why have this House’s internal auditors failed to do their job? Nobody is answering these questions, and I am mad as hell about it. I, like every other Member of this House, will make sure that these issues, far from disappearing into oblivion, are, as they must be, followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we are to release EUR 80 million to buy these buildings, which we actually paid for years ago. We are even getting one of them thrown in for free, without knowing what long-standing liabilities it conceals. A contract has been cobbled together under considerable pressure of time, without the purchase price being renegotiated in view of what has transpired in the past. If this contract is no better or no worse than its predecessors, it will, within the foreseeable future, be the subject of another debate in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
