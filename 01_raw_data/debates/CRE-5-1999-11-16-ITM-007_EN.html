<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lechner (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report concerns the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents. At first sight, this may appear a rather trivial, even irrelevant matter. It is in fact the case, however, that a citizen’s attempt to gain his rights largely begins when he serves a partner, a contracting party, or an adversary with documents such as statements of claim, responses, enforceable judgements or notarial instruments in the course of disputes, that is to say civil litigation, specifically by means of a formal, legally enforceable service procedure. However, when this has to be done across borders, i.e. from one country to another, then this attempt to fight for one‘s rights often comes to grief at this very first hurdle, for the corresponding service procedures in different countries tend to be incomprehensible, complicated, and time-consuming, as well as costly, and are the source of a considerable number of errors. The fundamental agreements under international law- primarily the Hague Agreement of 1965 in our case – contain numerous national opt-outs, are confusing and difficult to grasp and to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve this situation, the Member States concluded an appropriate agreement as early as 1997, on which Parliament gave its position. However, this agreement was not ratified. The proposal that has now been put forward by the Commission takes its inspiration from this agreement. As such, the Commission is exercising its right of initiative in the Community sphere of judicial cooperation in civil matters, based on Article 61c EEC in accordance with the procedure of Article 67, that is a unanimous decision from the Council of Ministers following parliamentary hearing. The United Kingdom and Ireland have declared that they wish to play a full part in the activities of the Community in judicial cooperation in civil matters. So far, Denmark has not made known whether it is also interested in joining the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of the directive is, as the title states, the service of documents in civil and commercial matters, i.e. specifically not in criminal matters. We are talking about one of several proposed measures in this field.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to be said as far as content goes is that if we were to do no more than replace the Hague and other agreements with a uniform, self-contained legal act of the Community then this alone would represent a considerable step forwards. It will render the legal position more easily accessible, it will simplify it and make it easier to comprehend. The most essential points to note are that in future, the transmission of documents is to proceed in a decentralised manner, directly between so-called transmitting agencies and receiving agencies, thus avoiding the delays caused by involving other agencies in the individual countries concerned. In addition, so-called central points are to be established whose purpose it will be to provide assistance when problems arise. Standard forms will be produced at Community level, common instructions as to the use of languages and translations will be provided, and not forgetting binding deadlines. </p>
<p class="contents">For all that the proposal may bring about a thoroughly remarkable improvement in the situation concerning cross-border lawsuits, still it does not go nearly far enough to my mind, particularly if a directive is to be proposed. A more suitable instrument, however, would be a regulation, for this would increase the binding nature of the legally relevant act and avoid possible sources of error.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the proposal contains too many derogations and special provisions for national exemptions, a relic of the practices under international law agreements. It is hard to see why a procedure for the service of documents, which ought, after all, to be efficient and fast, needs to be associated with a whole host of national special regulations. After all, this is not about the integrity, which is in every sense worthy of protection, of substantive, national systems of laws, nor is it about the equally justifiable protection which a state would like to afford its citizens in disputes, rather it is about straightening and levelling out the paths pursued in cross-border civil disputes, making them shorter, better, and above all faster, and indeed why should they not be cheaper as well?</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we are proposing to you a series of deletions and amendments intended to eliminate special provisions of this kind or at least only to permit them in exceptional cases, as for example with Articles 2, 9, 12 and 15. Several other improvements have been ventured in addition, for example with regard to translations, language problems, costs and differences of opinion between the competent offices.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Members of the Committee on Citizens‘ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs most warmly for their cooperation and the motions they have tabled. I am also in the Commission’s debt for the proposal it so rightly put forward which will bring about a considerable improvement in legal entitlement across national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposal does not go far enough. It is, as it were, a case of three steps forwards and then another one and a half steps back. The point of our motions is to ensure that when we take three steps forwards, we continue in that vein, and that retrograde steps – that is the exemption and special provisions – are dispensed with. Accordingly, I would ask you to give me your support and I would ask the Commission and Council of Ministers to adopt our proposals in the interests of improved legal entitlement for the citizens of our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gebhardt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, creating a uniform judicial area is one of the European Union’s fundamental tasks. It must afford the citizens protection and safety, indeed security on which they can rely. Otherwise the people will not feel at home in a Europe moving towards further integration and they will reject it. The uniform European judicial area must therefore be more than judicial cooperation between the Member States on the basis of international treaties. It must be coherent, guarantee an equally high level of protection everywhere and, above all, rule out any form of discrimination, even if it is only procedural in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam has enabled us to take a sizeable step forwards. In principle, it has “communitarised” judicial cooperation in civil matters. Instead of turning to international treaties in this field, the Member States must now reach for the European legal instruments, i.e. regulations and directives, which come into being with the participation of the European Parliament as the elected forum representing the people. We now have before us, in this draft regulation on family law, an important component of the European judicial area. When we have finished with it, it will be possible to make it available for inspection, for the Commission has produced a good proposal. It is no contradiction that I, as rapporteur, should, nevertheless, consider it necessary for a series of amendments to be made which the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, – please spare me having to use the correct name, which is unpronounceable – has unanimously approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to digress and touch on the matters of everyday life with which our legislation concerns itself. Breaking down borders between the Member States has not only created an internal market in Europe that is enabling the economy to flourish, it has also afforded the citizens of Europe a hitherto unknown degree of freedom. An ever increasing number of people are taking advantage of this new-found mobility. They get to know each other, find they like each other and pair off. Love has its own rules and develops at a pace that legislation has trouble keeping up with. This becomes clear only when there is a splitting up of partnerships that spanned the boundaries created by nationality and systems of laws. For it is then that former partners and different systems of laws quickly come to oppose each other as adversaries with all the unpleasant consequences this entails, children often being the ones to suffer most.</p>
<p class="contents">You will all be familiar with the kind of headlines we see when conflicts of this kind escalate to a point where people abduct their own children. Laws cannot stop people falling out and suffering the consequences. What laws can do though is to help keep this suffering within certain boundaries and ensure that there is no additional suffering owing to the application of differing, incoherent laws. The vagaries of the process alone can bring people to the point of despair, for example when it comes to the place of jurisdiction or the recognition of judgements. The Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for joint children represents an attempt within the scope of the law to help alleviate and avoid the suffering engendered by broken partnerships. </p>
<p class="contents">It was my responsibility, as a rapporteur within the European Parliament, to ensure that the required regulation attains its goals without it becoming as incomprehensible to the citizens of Europe as its title. This is the light in which we are to view those amendments which, as has already been mentioned, were unanimously approved in committee following intensive discussions. There was only one point on which opinion differed at the end of the vote in committee, that of giving a child the opportunity to be heard in custody proceedings. I personally consider it imperative for a child to be heard if we are to do all we can to secure his or her welfare. An alternative view is that this goal can be achieved by different methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Working together with Mr Watson, I have now arrived at a solution that takes account of both views. I would expressly like to extend my thanks to Mr Watson for this, for he too is particularly concerned with the welfare of children, who are often the ones to suffer most when couples separate. I intend to table the compromise we have reached as an oral amendment at the vote, and it is my hope that this distinguished Chamber will lend its support to this process tomorrow. It goes without saying that we should also adopt the amendment then.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another way in which we could lend added value to the regulation, although it is a point on which the European Parliament does not have the power to decide, only to request. As you are already aware, three Member States are not, in principle, party to the legally relevant acts of Title IV, in accordance with the Additional Protocols to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and are therefore not bound by them. However, two of these States are prepared to adopt the regulation we are discussing today. I urge the remaining State to accept the regulation as well. For if it were to do so then we would have taken a considerable step forward in terms of standardisation of family law within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, permit me to emphasise three points, in respect of which it was important to me, following numerous discussions with those affected and with lawyers, to improve the Commission’s sound proposal. Firstly, when conflicts occur, the welfare of the children must be paramount and all other interests must take second place. Secondly, there must be no discrimination where disputes are concerned. The law must afford everyone, wherever they happen to be in the European Union, a comparably high level of individual protection. Thirdly, the jurisdiction of courts must be unambiguous and easily understandable. There must be no possibility of the recognition and enforcement of judgements being used as weapons of revenge. I believe I have the support of the Commission and I would like to thank all those who, by virtue of their constructive cooperation, made things easier for me with this report outside the parliamentary routine. In addition, I would like, just this once, here in this Chamber, to sing the praises of the Council, which likewise put all its weight behind this issue and made known its view that we need to reach a sound decision here with all due haste.</p>

As the internal market develops, our citizens really need a legal framework that guarantees them access to justice wherever they are and whatever their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I will confine my remarks mainly to the report on the service of documents. I concur with Mr Lechner that the rules that formerly governed this are some 25 years old; they are complicated and out of date. With the increase in commercial transactions across the internal market, we need new, simple and certain rules. When our citizens or our businesses have to resort to the courts, they need to get past that first step, which is the service of documents, possibly in another jurisdiction, before initiating proceedings. Here we need a simple procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As a lawyer in private practice in the UK, I myself, have often wrestled with a pile of books to find the right rules and the right way to go forward for my clients in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals that we have before us take matters forward but perhaps they do not go far enough. My group will re-table certain amendments that were put to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to take matters forward even further, to make the systems that we are going to put in place more readily available and open to practitioners. We need to take this area of law outside the remit of a few specialists who may be able to charge a lot for it. We want to give our citizens across the Union real access to justice so that when they have to resort to the courts they can get things up and running quickly and without difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who comes into contact with judges and registrars in the cross-border areas of our Member States will know that this is a problem that urgently requires solving. For a long time, there has been an increasing number – and thankfully one that continues to increase – of marriages and familial relationships between people from different European countries. Naturally, this often results in a number of problems. There are also more and more people moving or emigrating from one country of the European Union to another in order to live and work there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that the current provisions pertaining to family law and also the international regulations on this subject are simply not adequate to deal with this problem. I would therefore like to join Mrs Gebhardt in offering special praise to the Council and Commission for their initiative in taking a decisive step towards solving this problem. This is indeed urgently necessary. Moreover, in my opinion the shortcomings that the document reveals are positively limited. There is a range of lesser aspects that have also been addressed in the committee discussions. For example, I still to this day do not fully understand why negative judgements should have been excluded from the scope of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this is particularly problematic, since the fact that negative judgements are not binding in all States may ultimately mean that a State in which a negative judgement is made may not recognise a positive judgement made in another state, with the result that we are once again faced with the disintegration of what constitutes law in the European Union, which, of course, we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that the Council to reconsider this aspect in its further discussions on this subject and that it consider whether this problem cannot indeed be resolved. In all other respects, I support the initiative; I think that it is a good one and think that it should be pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission and the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of the regulation are to ensure that judgements made in the Member States pertaining to divorce and other forms of separation are rapidly recognised by the other Member States, and also to provide up-to-date and uniform regulations governing parental responsibility for the joint offspring of spouses. This was made possible by means of the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year, which as part of heading IV in Articles 61 and 65 makes judicial cooperation in civil cases a firm part of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The sought-after aims cannot be achieved by the Member States alone and must therefore be realised at Community level on account of their transnational nature. This will enable the creation of a European legal area finally granting European citizens throughout the entire EU a common feeling of legal security and guaranteeing them a standard of marital status that is the same across Europe. Problems arising in the European Union in the past with regard to marriages between people of different nationality have been due to the fact that documents attesting to marital status used in connection with marriage ceremonies were not recognised in the same way by all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions regarding the competence of the courts and the validity of their judgements for spouses of different nationality who wanted to separate proved to be even more problematic. They revealed that one could not rely on judgements made at some point in the past and that judgements in custody cases frequently took no account of the children’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the present regulation is to improve and accelerate within the internal market the free movement of judgements in matrimonial cases and in parental responsibility proceedings. The aim of the European Union is to create an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of people is guaranteed and in which citizens of the Union can assert their rights with the same guarantees that they could obtain from the courts in their own country. The recognition of judgements in transnational family disputes should therefore be made easier by allowing the European Community to govern the recognition of divorce decrees passed by the competent courts.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a linguistically diverse legal area as the European Union, uncertainty and discrimination with regard to marriages between people of different nationality can also arise due to a lack of linguistic proficiency. We therefore support the call of the rapporteur<span class="italic"> </span>for the Member States to ensure that case records are drawn up in a language that both parties understand.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to governing the jurisdiction and recognition of judgements on the dissolution of marriages, the regulation also covers the custody proceedings that in many cases accompany a divorce. This point requires particular emphasis, as it represents a significant addition to the protection of the children in question, whose interests must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, only a very small amount of progress has been made in creating a European Legal Area for the citizens’ benefit. Recognising divorce decrees and judgements regarding parental responsibility will solve the legal and administrative problems with which citizens are confronted on a daily basis. The entry into force of this regulation will fill a loophole that has existed in the field of international private law and represents an important step towards extending the Union into an area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course because on this important subject of family law, the very broad area not regulated by the law due to the way judgements cease to be effective across borders has had a legal and moral effect on thousands of our citizens, damaging families’ social and psychological stability and particularly affecting the weakest members, that is, women and children. </p>
<p class="contents">We have all at some time been confronted with the tragedies and paradoxes that occur when there is no free movement of judgements, a situation which has resulted in justice being denied to individuals and the obvious absence and omission of obligatory and crucial European instruments, which, in terms of a common area, would eliminate the inconsistencies caused by the legal fragmentation that is the natural consequence of national legal systems. </p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is a sign of the creative development of the Community legal system and represents the introduction of a new series of common rules. Rules which are able to protect European citizens’ civil relationships, turning a European area which is fragmented in terms of the protection of rights and the enforcement of obligations into a more organised and structured area in which all citizens will be able to avail themselves, not only of their own national laws, but also now of a common European law which will apply to families in all areas of the Union, unless that area has asked that an exception be made in this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the path that we are taking in the area of judicial and civil cooperation is the right one. I therefore urge my friend, Commissioner António Vitorino, to continue along this path. There is no formal European citizenship, but there will be when in the most relevant branch of law, civil law, Europe has the legitimacy and the strength to guarantee our citizens’ rights and to enforce justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had the pleasure of discussing this yesterday with you, as well. The fact that we have this regulation on the agenda is also a very good way indeed of celebrating children’s rights. I know that rapporteur Gebhardt was thinking of just that point when drafting the amendments which I hope the Commission will adopt. In these, she pleads that, whatever judgements are made and whatever concrete steps are taken in this area, they should be so expressly with children’s best interests in mind. Thank you, Evelyne Gebhardt, for these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take the view, expressed by all the previous speakers, that this is needed in the mobile Europe of today. It is needed in the mobile Europe of today where, despite this mobility, we still experience discrimination. For example, articles 16 and 18 are needed so that cases of child abduction do not have to lead to judicial reviews. We know of course that child abduction and the prospect of a subsequent judicial review can lead to tremendously heart-rending conflicts. </p>
<p class="contents">I also share the view of Mrs Wallis, a colleague from my group, that we must go further, partly through supporting her amendments but also, I hope, through the Commissioner’s seeing new possibilities in the light of the Tampere Summit as to how we might go further in this area. Take, for example, maintenance disputes (an issue I understood not to be covered by this proposal), that is to say the financial aspect of the dissolution of a marriage, together with the issue of parental responsibility. These questions are not dealt with here but can in practice also involve problems which are tremendously difficult to solve. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to ask for colleagues’ support when our Group supports Amendment No 3, together with the corresponding amendment from Mr Lehne’s opinion as delivered to the committee responsible. In this way, we shall be able to reform the Nordic Convention in the same area. I hope that it will be possible for the Nordic Convention to go further and support the same objectives, but in that case we shall also need the explanations which were to be found in the opinion delivered on this proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Finally, I want to say that the present partnership should aim to create a situation in which we begin to rely more upon each other in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On account of the increased freedom of movement, more and more marriages between people of different nationality are taking place within the European Union. When these marriages take place or indeed are dissolved, particular problems frequently arise due to the different laws of the two States. The people who suffer the most in these cases are the children, who have to cope with additional problems, as if the other problems were not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal by the Council for a regulation on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial cases and parental responsibility proceedings now guarantees uniform marital status for the citizens of Europe. Marriage and divorce documents as well as judgements should, as a result, be recognised in all countries of the European Union. However, we must ensure that applying these principles does not continue to lead to differences and discriminations, something which unfortunately is currently the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the welfare of the children from these marriages must be ensured. Custody proceedings should be coherent and conclusive, and the result recognised everywhere. The basic interests of the children must come before everything else. The individual child must have the possibility of being heard before a court and in this way of clarifying that his or her welfare is taken into account. I hope that our colleague Mr Watson’s compromise solution does not create any additional problems, and that we are able to settle this important issue in the best interests of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in this way can we avoid international legal proceedings lasting several years and prevent child abduction, which unfortunately often happens as a result of legal confusion. We must tackle the problem of the various conflicts of laws that arise in matrimonial cases. Only in this way can we achieve legal security in the international domain for the citizens and children of Europe. For this reason, I would like to thank the rapporteur<span class="italic"> </span>Mrs Gebhardt on behalf of myself and my group, for her splendid report, and I hope that we can now take a major step forward in the best interests of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Really, we ought to be working for a global convention in this area, but the present proposal takes us some way down the road, for it is undoubtedly very important – as just about every speaker has agreed – that we recognise each other’s decisions on matrimonial issues and on matters concerning custody, especially at a time such as we are experiencing now where the structure of the family is undergoing tremendous change. In this connection, I can only express my pleasure at the fact that there are still a number of countries – including EU Member States – which recognise marriages between two people of the same sex and appreciate that such couples may also wish to have children and that this is a wish they can justifiably demand should be fulfilled. One can only hope that, in future where these matters are concerned, the motions of the heart will ever more be granted expression – as they have been in issues of divorce – and that the voices of religion and moralism will be hushed. My group can therefore back the report. As a Dane, I have a special problem, of course, when we talk about making decisions concerning legal questions under pillar 1, but I am certain that it is a problem which can be solved, for this is undoubtedly an area which Denmark also wishes to see put in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, no, I do not think there is anything to laugh about: in my opinion, families must not adopt a structure that is not part of the normal order of society. We are talking about an extremely sensitive issue, relationships within families, especially as regards citizens’ mobility within the boundaries of the European Union. Essentially, what we are dealing with is the protection of minors, which is already very difficult when they live in families that we could define as normal, or rather traditional. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that a particularly sensitive aspect is that of listening to children. Many of us, the different Member States of the European Union, have already addressed the issue of using children’s guardians at a time when families are going through a particularly difficult time in their lives, such as when couples separate, with all the repercussions – especially in psychological terms – that affect the children involved. </p>
<p class="contents">In the very short time I am allowed I would like to emphasise just a few points. Something that is of particular interest is parental authority, especially in relation to nomadic peoples who are now present in large numbers throughout Europe. Very often, as local administrators as well, we are faced with situations which are particularly regrettable and which are not covered by legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">This regulation certainly represents a significant step forwards – and we are grateful to the rapporteur for this – but we need to return to the issue with particular reference to nomadic children, to Roma children, and therefore to everything related to the internal problems of these families, including, precisely, with regard to mobility in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, since our objective is to contribute to an improvement, I wish to draw your attention to the draft amendment to Recital 10, which I consider problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it proper to entrust the task of defining the notion of parental responsibility to the Court of Justice, whereas the proposal for a Regulation envisaged that reference would be made to the national law of the Member State concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">Would it be an easy matter for the Court of Justice, to provide a definition of the notion of parental responsibility in isolation without the existence of a common family law for marital cases, which is neither desirable, nor envisaged at the present time?</p>
<p class="contents">My fear is that with this amendment, the application of this text, whose aim is to strengthen legal security, may create vagueness, which is harmful. Furthermore, attributing this new area of competence to the Court of Justice would surely increase the Court’s caseload, which is already excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs themselves note the very marked differences between Member States as regards private law, thus explaining the serious reservations expressed within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would suggest that the rapporteurs should be satisfied with resorting to a Community legal instrument without seeking to harmonise the fundamental legal concepts.

<p class="contents">The solutions which we must arrive at must fulfil a twofold role. Firstly, every plaintiff must be able to find a judge for his case, otherwise this would be denial of justice. He should be able to find applicable law, and it must be possible to enforce the judgement. This is the requirement of legal security. Secondly, in the meantime, it is essential to ensure that the diversity of Member State legislation is respected. This is no more than the translation into the legal sphere of respect for cultural or national diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get away from the unification of legislation which is too often pursued here on the pretext of harmonisation. The obvious solution is to unify international private law rules exclusively, without unifying the fundamental rules. Unification of international private law rules, i.e. regulations on conflicts of jurisdiction and rules on conflicts of laws. It must be possible to clearly identify which law the court is going to apply, since a court with local jurisdiction does not necessarily apply its national law and in some circumstances this procedure is a fair one.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the development of enforcement procedures – the enforcement orders or “exequatur” for foreign judgements – this is no doubt useful in civil cases, such as divorce or custody cases, just as they are useful in some aspects of mutual assistance in legal matters, but care must be taken not to go too far along this route. We must not arrive at a situation where, under the pretext of mutual assistance in legal matters, a wall of silence reigns over Europe in the name of political correctness. I shall not mention Switzerland’s degrading handover of an old man, 90 years old, to France, since this is a matter involving a country which is not a member of the European Union, but I shall simply mention the increasingly repressive legislation which mean to dictate political and historical attitudes, a phenomenon I would not like to see spreading from one European state to the next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It organises judicial cooperation at Community level and introduces uniform rules in international private law, an area in which they were sorely lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Standard treatment of all European citizens in connection with family disputes and the care and control of children in the event of divorce will spare thousands of families considerable anguish and bureaucratic obstruction, thereby bolstering the sense of security and confidence in the European Union of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed changes, such as giving the child an opportunity to be heard before taking a decision and full compliance with the Hague Convention, seek mainly to safeguard the rights and interests of children. I hope that Mrs Gebhardt will use her considerable skills to draft a change which satisfies all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this generally positive assessment of the directive notwithstanding, I believe that numerous matters still remain unresolved, such as full application of the new arrangements to third country nationals resident in the European Union and to persons living together outside close, traditional family arrangements. The directive is a good directive; however, it needs to be more daring if it is to pave the way, in the foreseeable future, for a single European family law which takes account of the huge social, economic and cultural changes which are the order of our day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all have a recollection of a number of cases, such as the Lancelin-Thiemann case which last year contaminated discussions between Germany and France on the subject of the dramatic situation of the children of this couple.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gebhardt report rightly stresses that the increasing level of free movement within the European Union is causing and will in future cause an increasing number of marriages between nationals of different countries, hence the interest of examining this question. Current European law has not managed to draw the conclusions of this development, thus placing couples, and more particularly children, in a very complex position.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation submitted for our opinion today is therefore particularly welcome in so far as it includes unquestionable advantages in relation to the so-called Brussels II Convention, signed in 1998, but not as yet ratified. If it is unanimously adopted in Council, this regulation may come into force very soon and shall be applied immediately and harmoniously throughout the European Union, thus enabling long drawn out wrangling over jurisdiction, which is harmful to everyone, to be prevented. I would add that this proposal for a regulation specifically targets legal judgements relating to parental responsibility for joint children, corresponding to the requests made on several occasions by this House. But, like other Members, I am concerned by two amendments, Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 5, which is going to attribute a number of responsibilities relating to parental authority to the Court of Justice. I am afraid that this is not a matter for its jurisdiction and, moreover, that this may increase the caseload of this Court. In my opinion, we should stick to the Commission text. If this is the case, I shall support Mrs Gebhardt’s report, which I hope will be widely adopted by Parliament in these terms.</p>
<p class="contents">If there were just one thing to bear in mind, this would be the interest of the children, and I have my doubts as to whether it would be in the interest of the children if Parliament were to adopt these two amendments. Children are the ones with a lot to gain from the rapid implementation of regulations acknowledging their simple right not to have to endure the choice of their parents to live in different European countries. Of course, major problems will remain, particularly the matter of the disparity of applicable divorce laws and the consequences of this, but this regulation is just an initial step and I congratulate the rapporteur on this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would like firstly to express my pleasure that the opinions relating to the proposal for a directive on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters have been adopted, as well as the proposal for a regulation on the competence, recognition and implementation of judgements on matrimonial matters. I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Lechner and Mr Gebhardt for their excellent work as the rapporteurs of these two initiatives. These two instruments constitute one of the foundation stones of the Community building that we are constructing, the main aim of which is to give all the Union’s citizens and legal operators easier, more rapid and more efficient access to justice with a safeguard from the rules of legal security. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for a regulation is concerned, by reducing the time it takes to transmit judicial and extrajudicial documents from one Member State to another, we are adopting an instrument which will enable the judicial processes to progress in the best conditions of speed and legal security whilst preserving the rights of all parties involved. </p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to highlight the importance of adopting the proposal for a regulation which constitutes a cornerstone of the creation at Community level of a European legal area. To this effect, the Tampere European Council made the mutual recognition of judgements one of the pivotal points in the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Heads of State and Government themselves recognised the fact that priority must be given to family relationships and particularly to resolving issues of divorce and parental responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">If the movement of people within the European Union is going to be more than an empty phrase, it must be accompanied by the necessary measures in the field of family law. This proposal is the first, and only the first of these measures, because it provides standardised rules on the jurisdiction of courts in the Member States in matters of divorce and separation as well as in the matter of processes relating to the enforcement of parental responsibility, and even provides a clear and coherent framework for rapid, practically automatic recognition in every Member State of judgements made in another Member State within the scope of the regulation. These are legal instruments that will open the way for the future adoption of other solutions that go further in the direction the Tampere European Council wanted. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the directive is concerned, the Council can accept practically all of the amendments, except the amendments relating to Nos 3, 5 and 10, which we feel do not fit in with the proposal’s premise. </p>
<p class="contents">If I am not mistaken, Amendment No 3 brings nothing new to the measure in question, in that the Member States which will designate a single authority and then a central authority are precisely the ones whose legislation does not allow for the direct transmission of judgements. As for Amendment No 5, we feel that it places an excessive burden on the central authorities in the context of a directive-based system in which these central authorities have only a subsidiary function. And finally, concerning Amendment No 10, we feel that it contradicts Article 11(2) of the proposal for a directive. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for a regulation is concerned, we can accept most of the proposed amendments, namely Amendments Nos 1 to 8, 13 to 18 and 20. </p>
<p class="contents">We feel that Amendments Nos 9 and 10 can be partially accepted, with a slight alteration which does not change them fundamentally. We have objections to three amendments: Nos 11, 12 and 19. Concerning Amendment No 11 – and I hope that a new oral proposal will be made so that I can comment on the new version – where it states that the best interests of the child must be taken into account, we feel that this would clear the way for a judgement to be made – with regard to the costs to be borne by the State due to receive the judgement – which is not appropriate for this kind of instrument. We agree, therefore, with the principle of child hearings, but not with a new judgement on this basis. We feel Amendment No 12 gives an advantage to the mechanical implementation of a possible, out of date judgement over a more recent one which may have been issued on the same matter. Priority must be given to the most recent judgement, because that will be the one that best takes into account the child’s situation at the time the verdict is made. And finally, in relation to Amendment No 19, I understand the meaning of the proposal, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the rule concerning the translation of decisions does not fall within the scope of a regulation on the competence, recognition and implementation of judgements; the proper place for the rule on translations is the directive on the transmission of documents, the other instrument that we are debating today, which lays down precisely this possibility of translation. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I am convinced that by adopting these instruments we are giving a great boost to the free movement of persons today. And we are providing a balanced boost, because, on the one hand, we are favouring the internal market and economic integration with the directive on judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters, but, on the other hand, we are also attempting to give primacy to people’s rights, to the rights of human beings and to the rights of children, because, in addition to having to suffer the trauma that a divorce always causes, they should not have to suffer the trauma of the bureaucratic nightmare that the recognition of judgements involves. And this is at last proof that the Union provides added value for our citizens’ actual lives. And thus we honour a major principle of the project of European construction, which is designed to think of people, by people and for people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
