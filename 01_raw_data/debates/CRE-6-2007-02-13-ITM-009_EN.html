I would like to confirm that the Commission and I, personally, are very much involved in this case. We showed that in our recent report to Parliament on 17 January. I can assure you that reaching a satisfactory solution has top priority. We know it is a tragic case. In the meantime, our team of negotiators is engaged in a dialogue with the Libyan authorities. This is still open. However, it is also expected that no decision can be taken as long as the judicial procedure is not concluded. There is still one step to go.</p>

I am grateful also to all European politicians who have been going to Libya non-stop and raising this point. But we can safely say that, after such a long period of time, there is no result. On the contrary: lately, the Libyan side – even Colonel Gaddafi – has been raising non-stop the question of some Western plot to kill these children, with our nurses having acted as part of this plot. No one answers these charges and, if you trust the Libyan court, we should say that the court decided some years ago that there is no such plot. Still it is raised.

<p class="contents">Now, let me say it is also not true that we have never reacted. On the contrary, we have reacted very clearly and have tried to get the nurses out. We had hoped that this would happen recently. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Unfortunately, in December 2006 the death penalty was reconfirmed. We had hoped for a totally different judgment. With regard to the question of the accusation concerning the HIV/Aids infection, I must tell you that the conclusions of the most recent Council of Foreign Ministers clearly state, ‘this verdict ignores strong evidence from world-renowned international experts as to the innocence of the defendants’. So, all these questions are clearly on the table, as I said. Bear with us. There is also a little bit of confidence necessary and a little bit of confidentiality.

<p class="contents">In late December and early January, EU Member States including Poland were faced with the threat of a breakdown in natural gas supplies as a result of a dispute between Russia and Belarus, and on 8 January 2007 Russia cut off oil supplies to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, again owing to the ongoing dispute with Belarus. These are, regrettably, but the latest examples of Russia using energy supplies as a means of exerting political pressure on EU Member States and third countries and are proof of that country's lack of reliability in energy matters.</p>

Let us remember the wake-up call we had last year between Russia and Ukraine and this year between Russia and Belarus. I would like to try to provide you today with a short summary of the different initiatives that the Commission has taken to increase our security of supply in general, and in particular in the relationship with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy supplies from the Russian Federation play an important role in meeting Europe’s energy needs, accounting for nearly 30% of the EU’s oil imports and 44% of our gas imports. At the same time, 67% of Russia’s oil and gas exports are delivered to the European market and, given the mutual importance of this relationship, an energy dialogue was established in 2000 between the Russian Federation and the EU to discuss energy-related issues, including energy policy, market developments, infrastructure and EU-Russia energy cooperation on technology and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a roadmap for the common economic space that was agreed during the EU-Russia Summit in May 2005, and that includes cooperation on wide-ranging issues of energy and related activities. Moreover, a new agreement is to be negotiated with the Russian Federation to follow on from the existing EU-Russia partnership and cooperation agreement which expires at the end of the year. It is now intended that this will include a comprehensive agreement on energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that in the recent communication, ‘An Energy Policy for Europe’, the Commission formulated quite a number of proposals to mitigate our growing dependence on external energy supplies and to increase our energy security. The Commission underlines that there is no singular solution, but there has to be a variety of different initiatives that must be pursued. They include increased energy efficiency, promotion of renewable energy sources, the diversification of energy supplies, proper functioning of the internal market and internal solidarity mechanisms to cope with possible supply interruptions, including through cooperation with the International Energy Agency. Furthermore, the importance of strengthening our relations with all our key energy suppliers and transit countries and for the EU to speak with a single voice is also underlined in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to recent interruptions in the energy supply field from Russia through Belarus, the Commission also convened meetings earlier this year of both the Gas Coordination Group and the Oil Support Group, which comprised, inter alia, representatives of the Member States. These meetings to which the third countries concerned were invited to give information then reviewed the impact on the EU’s internal energy security of the events in question and how to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with reference to the area of strengthening energy dialogue, the Commission is committed to maintaining and to reinforcing our energy relations, not only with the Russian Federation, but also with other important energy-producing countries and regions like Norway, the countries of the OPEC, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the countries of the Caspian and the Black Sea basins, Central Asia and North Africa through bilateral agreements and energy dialogues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The peace canal in the Middle East</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 10 December representatives of Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the World Bank examined a feasibility study on the construction of the ‘Peace’ or ‘Two Seas’ canal, which would run 180 kms from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. The economic significance (irrigation of the Negev desert, supplying hydroelectric plants and desalination plants, providing one billion cubic metres of potable water annually), the diplomatic significance (dialogue and cooperation between Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan) and the environmental significance (tackling the danger of the drying out of the Dead Sea by 2050) of this enterprise are enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall cost is calculated at US$ 15.5 million which have been committed by the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the construction of this canal is important from many points of view, will the Commission contribute to the implementation (planning and financing) of this ambitious project within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation? If not, does it intend to make a financial contribution to the next stage during which US$ 3 billion will be spent on completing the project over the next five years?

The Commission is strongly in favour of forward-looking projects which address the water needs and environmental needs of the region, and it supports all the initiatives which involve cooperation between the neighbours on specific issues, particularly on water, a very important resource in the region, in order to find mutually satisfactory solutions. But we also have to say that the construction of the ‘Peace’ canal would be a huge undertaking, a huge endeavour, which could have a significant impact on the local environment without necessarily addressing the causes of these lower Dead Sea levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We think, therefore, that a somewhat cautious approach is necessary. The Commission notes that a feasibility study including an environmental and social impact assessment has recently been commissioned. A multi-donor trust fund has been established, with France, the USA, the Netherlands and Japan making firm commitments of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The contract for the feasibility study is expected to be awarded in July of this year, and then it could last for over two years. The Commission will then examine the outcome of the feasibility study very carefully when it is published and will consult with the European Investment Bank in the light of its recommendations.

All of that is in the context of the political environment and the political solution and at this very moment we are cautiously optimistic because there is the outline at the horizon of a national unity government in Palestine. Hopefully we can start to have a sort or regional cooperation again – at least between a few countries and the Palestinian Authority.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Full liberalisation of postal services on 1 January 2009</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 18 October 2006 the Commission adopted the draft directive <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0594">COM(2006)0594</a> final amending Directive 97/67/EC concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services. This proposes full liberalisation of postal services, that is, to include small postal items weighing less than 50 grams. Two aspects are often criticised: that the Commission has chosen to maintain the date of 1 January 2009 for the directive to enter into force, although it is well known that many Member States will not be ready by that date, and that it has made insufficient provision for financing the universal postal service, which 10 traditional postal service operators have criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s response to these criticisms? Has the Commission examined carefully and in detail the impact of full liberalisation of postal services in Sweden, where it had been expected for many years? In Sweden, was there an increase in the cost of stamps for small postal items, and were there public sector job losses? If so, in what proportion? How satisfied are the Swedes following this liberalisation? The Swedish experience is a concrete example and not the result of a study or theoretical or ideological speculation. Has it been a clear success? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s analysis, which was based on several years of studies and continuous and transparent discussions with all stakeholders, is presented in considerable detail in the Commission’s preparatory documents. The proposal for a directive and its supporting documents are now under discussion in both the Council and the European Parliament. It is up to you and the Member States in the Council to make your own evaluation. The Commission took into account the Swedish experience to which the honourable Member refers, as well as all other market and regulatory developments in the postal sector. It is not a question of attributing a particular value judgement to any or all of these developments or to suggest that the Swedish model, or indeed another model, should be copied elsewhere. It is rather a question of showing that various solutions exist. These solutions can be implemented according to the specificities of each national market in order to conduct the necessary postal reform while guaranteeing the provision of an efficient universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that in Sweden the opening of the market was completed, guaranteeing the provision of the universal service, without the need for additional financing. The Swedish Government recently presented a detailed study on the opening of the Swedish postal market, and its findings do not seem to confirm the fears expressed by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, and as I said earlier, the Commission believes that completing postal reform is vital for securing further improvements in efficiency and quality of service and for ensuring the long-term viability of the postal sector and the business opportunities and employment potential it generates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In one question, I alluded to the solutions being studied by the Committee of Enquiry into post liberalisation. When we talk about solutions, that means there is a problem, but we can see at the moment that, when it comes to the delivery of small mail items – which is the topic on the agenda – there is no problem. The people are happy, and deliveries are running smoothly. In contrast, where the delivery of small items has been liberalised, such as in Sweden, stamps are more expensive and the service is worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, why is the Commission ruling out retaining the reserved area with which we are familiar, which enables and safeguards the universal service for all Europeans, as would certainly not be the case with the projects you are proposing, as previous experience has demonstrated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The only problem we have seen in those countries where liberalisation has happened earlier than other Member States is that the old monopolies from the Member States that still have a monopoly market have tried to come to our markets and use the liberalisation on their behalf.

<p class="contents">We are aware of the concerns about the level of interest rates charged in Greece and have responded to several written questions on the subject. In our answers, we have highlighted a series of initiatives that could have an impact on the level of retail interest rates in Europe. They include initiatives on mortgage credit and consumer credit as well as the competition sectoral inquiries launched in June 2005 in the areas of business insurance and retail banking. These initiatives, together with others presented in the White Paper on Financial Services Policy for 2005 to 2010, should improve the competition and efficiency of retail financial services markets and provide practical benefits for European consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the honourable Member’s specific question, we support initiatives that encourage and promote transparency in European financial markets. Transparency is of particular importance for consumers, who need full and accurate information to be able to make an informed choice. In the competition area, the Commission names banks against which a decision concluding an anti-trust infringement is addressed. However, there are no European rules requiring the naming of banks which the Member States’ supervisory authorities have fined for unethical and illegal practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to monitor the level of interest rates as our initiatives on retail financial services progress to ensure that the benefits from integration provide practical benefits for European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yes, it is known to us that the level of interest rates charged in Greece are very high, but we do not have particular responsibility to make any change in that, nor is it likely that the Union will have responsibility in this area in the future. In other Member States where the winds of competition have blown, the interest rate charged to consumers has come down dramatically. I have personal experience in this regard from my home Member State. When a retail financial institution from another Member State announced that it was coming to set up shop in the Member State I know best, interest rates contracted overnight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Money laundering</span></p>
<p class="contents">It has plausibly been claimed recently by the City of London Corporation that the European Union's fight against money laundering – and therefore potentially terrorist financing – through creation of an effective regime to deter and detect criminals is being hampered by Member States' inconsistent, uneven and inadequate implementation of the 2001 Second Money Laundering Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With the third Money Laundering Directive due for implementation in 2007, what strategy does the Commission now have for enforcing prompt, proper and uniform implementation of EU law on this vital subject across all Member States, one which maximises the chance of hunting down suspicious transactions while minimising unnecessary cost and red tape for businesses and honest customers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive reinforces our actions in the fight against terrorist financing. It provides for harmonised rules under which the obliged entities and persons can apply customer due diligence procedures, taking into account the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. In order to help Member States ensure a timely and proper transposition of this directive, we are following a threefold strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in November 2006 we held an initial transposition workshop. The objective of this meeting was to exchange views and provide clarity on issues of interpretation or any other problem linked to transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have set up a European platform between the Financial Intelligence Units. These are the national authorities competent to prevent and counter money-laundering and terrorist financing by receiving and analysing suspicious transaction reports filed by credit and financial institutions, as well as by selected non-financial businesses and professions. The FIUs are directly involved in the enforcement of the directive. Within the European platform, regular meetings are organised to exchange information, notably on the provision of feedback to reporting entities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we support the work carried out by the joint Anti-Money-Laundering Task Force which the Committee of European Banking Supervisors has created in association with the European insurance supervisors and the securities markets supervisors. The objective of this task force is to enable the sharing of experience and best practices between financial services supervisors. This is crucial for a consistent implementation of the directive across the European Union. The Commission participates as an observer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sounds as if you are going to get a lot of information. However, are you going to issue some guidelines to secure more consistent application?

<p class="contents">I appreciate what you are doing, but why not issue some guidelines, which would go some way to getting some consistency? Otherwise there is going to be even more of a mess when the third anti-money-laundering directive is implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From my knowledge of previous directives, practice varies from Member State to Member State. Furthermore, within Member States, it probably varies between financial institutions – I am aware of that too, but you must remember it is quite early days. I know that we are now on the third anti-money-laundering directive, but people are learning and, hopefully, with the processes we have set up, such as the bodies I have just referred to, best practices can be established and then people can learn from one another.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not rule out making some guidelines in the future, as the honourable Member referred to. Perhaps that will be done in the future, either by the Commission or some agency on our behalf through all these processes. However, as the honourable Member will understand, we have gone for the risk-based approach, which leaves a fair degree of flexibility in the hands of the entities, and that leads to some of the problems we have just outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if you went for the more prescriptive approach, line by line, it would probably take ages to get agreement between the different Member States because of the different cultures in this particular area. Hopefully, we are learning, and I do not rule out any future initiative that would bring greater consistency in this area, which is what, I believe, everybody desires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The people of the Black Mesa the Dineh and Hopi indians have fought against coal mining on their territory, and all that it entails, for more than 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this year, the coal mine and pipeline which use the indians' only water reservoir were closed down. Unfortunately, the joy was short-lived. There are now plans for a re-opening and an expansion with the ensuing forced displacement of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Black Mesa Mountain is sacred to these people and the operation would be akin to a company quarrying stone from Notre Dame in Paris (the mountain is considered to be a woman). Is breaking up the sacred symbols of a religion not a violation of religious freedom?</p>

The European Union seeks to uphold the universality and indivisibility of human rights – civil, political, economic, social and cultural – as reaffirmed by the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands that the Dineh and Hopi Indians would like to preserve their identity by controlling mining activities on their territory. While the Commission is not convinced that the functioning of the coal plant would breach any relevant instruments of international law protecting religious freedom, it nonetheless takes the rights of indigenous peoples very seriously, as set out in the Commission’s May 1998 working document on indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the production of coal in the United States is subject to environmental rules, and the overall issue of rights in this instance falls within the competence of the US Government. On the more general issue of whether import bans of coal would be effective in upholding the rights of people in specific localities, it would be difficult to determine the specific origin of coal being imported into the European Union. Consequently, a ban of this sort would be difficult to implement in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also understand that their rights are protected in the US Constitution, and so it is principally a matter for the US courts and not for us to intervene. I would just repeat what I said, that import bans of the sort being envisaged are really not a desirable way, in the Commission’s view, of dealing with such issues. An import ban would have no effect if the coal in question were exported to countries other than the European Union, which would no doubt be the case, so any sanction that we introduced would, in our view, make no material difference to the objective situation of these indigenous peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Davos meeting of WTO trade ministers in January signalled the formal resumption of work in Geneva across all the negotiating groups. What lay behind this was an injection of new political commitment to the negotiations at senior levels, including from President Bush. I believe this is sincere and that there is, therefore, a new level of political investment in the process, which creates a fresh opportunity for finding success. On this basis, the Director-General of the WTO announced in the Trade Negotiating Committee on 31 January that negotiations in Geneva should restart at multilateral level in all the negotiating groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Farm subsidies remain the gateway to a deal. But a breakthrough inside agriculture must trigger a meaningful commitment to reductions in industrial tariffs and, further down the line, specific market-opening commitments in trade in services. In these areas, we are looking for meaningful and substantial moves by emerging economies in the G-20 group, without which it will not be possible to conclude the round.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, US negotiators have started to turn the corner, but they have not reached the point of showing to us what new reduction of trade-distorting farm subsidies they intend to table. This is indispensable to the progress we are seeking. Susan Schwab, the US Trade Representative, is reaching out to the Democratic Congressional leadership in order to prepare the ground and to see how she can meet some of their requirements for an extension of the Administration’s fast-track negotiating authority, the Trade Promotion Authority, but she has not, so far, been ready to make the necessary jump either to agreement with Congress, or convergence with the US trade partners on key aspects of the current negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Administration’s preliminary proposal last week for a new farm bill was welcome but somewhat disappointing in this context. If we are to have a successful outcome in the WTO, the US will need to align the new farm bill with more ambitious cuts and disciplines in trade-distorting subsidies negotiated as part of the Doha Round.</p>
<p class="contents">On timing, however, the US roadmap is somewhat clearer. A breakthrough on core issues in the Doha Development Agenda is the platform on which the Bush Administration says it will request a new or extended TPA before its expiry in June. That implies a breakthrough in the next few months on the big numbers in the key parts of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in our interest to try to seize the opportunity that now exists to reach a conclusion. I do not, myself, think that postponing a push for a deal into the summer or later is a realistic option. Given all the uncertainties in the United States and elsewhere, we would risk losing the fragile momentum that has been created, and this judgement accords with that of the European Council as reflected in the Presidency’s summing-up at the General Affairs Council on Monday. A DDA outcome would be very worth having, economically, politically and for the sake of the international system, and therefore we will continue to negotiate constructively but toughly for a deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In answer to the earlier question, my view is very clearly this: in order to advance to the other stages of negotiation, to those sectors of the talks which will yield the greatest economic and developmental benefits to the global economy and in particular to developing countries – namely industrial tariffs, liberalisation of services, the strengthening of trade rules, and in particular trade facilitation – we need first to break the agricultural deadlock in which these negotiations have been stuck now for very many months.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that, we need a clear sense from the United States of the direction of its policy concerning trade-distorting farm subsidies. Until that is clear, it will not be possible to clarify for the United States the answers to its questions concerning agricultural market access, because inevitably, when asked by the United States and others in the competitive agricultural economies how far they will open their markets to farm goods from the US and elsewhere, the developing countries will reply: ‘Well what are we importing? What are you expecting us to give you access for? Farmed goods or US Treasury subsidies?’</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an unreasonable question for developing countries to ask and therefore it is only when we get greater clarity and firmness about US intentions on farm subsidies that other questions will be easier to answer within the other agricultural pillars of the negotiation – market access and export competition – thus also allowing us to move on to the substantive negotiations in the other sectors of these talks.</p>
<p class="contents">My view, as I said in my opening remarks, is that the United States is making a reasonable engagement. It is making a good effort vis-à-vis the US Congress and its negotiating partners to take these talks forward, but we have yet to see on the table any clear, firm new offer on farm subsidies and, until that is the case, it will be difficult for others to match what the United States does by making further offers of their own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of them, as you have rightly said, fear that opening up their markets would be a one-way process of importing more, but not necessarily exporting more.

I think rightly it will be a condition for their support for a final result – an outcome of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">So right from way back the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, has been pushing very strongly the case for aid for trade. I am glad to say that at the Hong Kong Ministerial, a clear commitment – independent of the single undertaking – was made and entered into. I hope others in the developed world will clearly be able to match what we are putting in order to make that programme and the resources that need to support it a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would also emphasise the importance of duty-free, quota-free access to others’ markets by the least-developed countries in the WTO. This is a commitment that we have made of very long standing and which we want others, both in the developed world and amongst the emerging economies insofar as they are able, to match. A proportionate effort from these World Trade talks would make a very big difference to creating fairness and a proportionate benefit for those who need it most in the developing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the next programming period between 2007 and 2013, the amount will be approximately EUR 1.3 billion in contributions from the European Union. It will be available for granting support to Bavaria’s rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the measures implemented are: village renewal, support for different tourism activities, and support for farmers working in less-favoured areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, and in the next programming period, those in the border areas with the Czech Republic have benefited and will continue to benefit substantially from the implementation of these and other measures in the context of Bavaria’s rural development programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The new draft ERDF Operational Programme 2007-2013 for Bavaria pays particular attention to the rural and structurally weak areas bordering the Czech Republic. The Bavarian authorities have proposed to concentrate in these areas more than EUR 300 million out of the ERDF contribution, which totals EUR 575 million, including a special allocation of EUR 84 million for the border areas alone. These funds shall be used for co-financing projects destined to promote, inter alia, tourism and different cultural activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period between 2004 and 2006, a total of almost EUR 85 million was spent under this EAGGF with Czech contributions in the Czech border regions, and this shows that there is actually a very big absorption capacity. Thus the Commission believes that this trend will continue in the next programming period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft rural development plan of the Czech Republic includes measures to support cultural heritage, and it will be funded with approximately EUR 50 million from the ERDF. Furthermore, the Czech/Bavarian INTERREG cross-border programme – that started this year on 1 January 2007 – has a budget of EUR 115 million. That programme, which has just been officially submitted to the Commission, includes both rural development and support for different cultural measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 12 December 2006, the Commission announced a review of the regulatory framework for ‘de minimis’ aid, extending its scope to the sale and processing of agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the 'specific conditions' under the de minimis rule for the allocation of aid to undertakings selling and processing agricultural products? How does this regulatory framework relate to individual provisions regarding agriculture (which to date excluded agriculture from the scope of the ‘de minimis’ aid rule)? What are the conditions for accumulating de minimis aid with state aid? What are the anticipated effects of a more flexible regulatory framework on the development of the agricultural sector in the EU and, in particular, in Greece? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before 1 January 2007, the ‘de minimis’ aid for processing and for marketing was governed by the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1860/2004 and limited to EUR 3000 per beneficiary over any period of three years, within a maximum global ceiling established for each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Processing and marketing of agricultural products have been included within the scope of the new regulatory framework because of the similarities between those activities on the one hand and processing and marketing of non-agricultural products, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of processing and marketing of agricultural products, ‘de minimis’ aid may be accumulated with state aid, provided that this does not exceed the maximum aid intensity laid down for measures supported by state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new and much more flexible rules for the ‘de minimis’ regulations, Greece, like all other Member States, will have more scope for granting aid in a much more rapid way, as the ‘de minimis’ aid will not have to be notified. There will be more advantageous conditions than those laid down in other rules applicable to state aid. This flexibility will enhance the development of the agricultural sector in Member States within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Proposed reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables</span></p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation on the reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables is designed to amend the current aid scheme for the processing of certain types of citrus fruit (Regulation (EC) No 2202/96<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) and to convert it into decoupled aid related to land area and included within the single payment (Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>). When the resulting amount of aid is applied to the total land area devoted to citrus fruits in each Member State, one hectare of citrus fruits in Italy will be eligible for approximately EUR 700, one hectare in Greece for EUR 600 and one hectare in Spain for around EUR 300.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the level of aid received by the fruit and vegetable sector is minimal (and is lower than what other Community sectors receive), has the Commission calculated whether or not there is an adequate margin within the overall average level of support offered to the fruit and vegetable sector to enable coupled aid to continue in its current format? If that margin genuinely exists, on the basis of which technical reports is the amendment to the current scheme and the conversion thereof into decoupled aid proposed?</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission assessed the impact which the decoupling of aid will have on the Community juice industry and the possible effects thereof on prices and on the quantities of juice imported from non-EU countries, in particular Brazil? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inclusion of the fruit and vegetable sector into the Single Payment scheme will lead to an even more market-oriented sector and it will give producers a certain stability of income.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has predicted a distribution of aid in the Single Payment scheme that nobody could access at this moment, since it depends on the system applied for Member States from one Member State to another. The allocation of aid depends on the rights granted by the Member States according to objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has been preceded by different initiatives. In 2004, the commission presented a communication which resulted in the Dutch Presidency of the Council establishing the line to follow. There was also the own-initiative report of the European Parliament in May 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Commission has received several evaluation studies in relation to the sector. An impact assessment document has also been drawn up. The impact assessment includes wide public consultation. Most of the organisations that responded wanted continued support for producer organisations. Better promotion of the consumption of fruit and vegetables is also considered to be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">On decoupling, opinions differ depending on the different products concerned. Certain contributors consider that it is the right response to the problem of management and differences in treatment that we see in the sector today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully convinced that the reform proposal will have a positive effect on the whole fruit and vegetable sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am completely sure that we will be coming back to this on the basis of our new reform proposal, on which I had a very interesting and in-depth discussion with the Agriculture Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, of course we want to make a reform that makes the sector stronger. Why should we not try to get that solution? I am quite sure that what is in the proposal will deliver a stronger, much more market-oriented sector in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also includes a strengthening of the producer organisations because, when we have been looking at the different Member States to see how they have managed this producer organisation possibility, there are huge varieties. In some Member States where the fruit and vegetable sector is strong, there are not so many producer organisations and the level of organisation from producers is very high indeed. That makes the sector strong in competition with the retail sector, and this will be crucial in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also includes a crisis management tool in the toolbox of the producer organisations. This is to make the producer organisations more attractive for producers to enter.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also simplified the system with a new proposal because all the land for fruit and vegetables, for apples and for potatoes for consumption will now be included in the single farm payment system, which is a huge simplification because, today, there are different types of entitlements.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes, it will be an advantage for the sector, and I would be happy to come back and discuss this subject in more detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
