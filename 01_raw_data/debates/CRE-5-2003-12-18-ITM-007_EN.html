My impression was that they are very good people. It is a beautiful country, the food is excellent, the history is rich and the sense of humour is good. We visited Stalin's birthplace and went to a huge museum. Upstairs there is a circular room, at one end of which there are quotes about Stalin by contemporary world leaders. They are in the Georgian language and the Georgian alphabet, so I had to ask the guide what Winston Churchill had said about Stalin of which they are so proud. She replied that Winston Churchill had said that Stalin would be remembered by history. I enjoyed that.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia is also beset by troubles. It has Russian interference – Russian soldiers, although they promised to leave. There are separatist tendencies splitting the country – pulling it apart – and, above, all, there is deep corruption. Money is made from kidnapping foreigners.</p>
<p class="contents">So the first step – the peaceful revolution they have undergone – was a wonderful first step, which this Parliament welcomes very strongly. However, they have a long way to go, although we would like to help them. They must eliminate corruption to create confidence for foreign investment, and that will create trade, jobs and prosperity. In the long run, I for one do not see why they should not one day become members of our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, without constructive cooperation from both Russia and the United States, it will be difficult to find a solution that is not merely abstract. The word ‘abstract’ seems appropriate for our document, which is indeed full of principles and high hopes, but does not give any indication as to whether these will one day be realised.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s resolution we hope, for example, that the elections of 4 January – that is, in a few days time – will include the peoples of the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia: two breakaway regions. We are calling for this even though we know that it is a pipe dream, that it is a matter of principle, even though we do not know if this is something that can be called for or if it is – so to speak – merely an extremely abstract statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should, for example, call for a move towards authorising Russian identity documents for citizens of Abkhazia and now also for the third dissident region because, after the forced resignation of Mr Shevardnadze, a third dissident region is emerging, Ajaria.</p>
<p class="contents">After the fall of Shevardnadze, the Moscow meeting of the three regions – I repeat, no longer two but three – which to varying extents want to break away from Georgia, also increases the uncertainty. Can the European Union use its instruments and diplomatic relations to discover the political intentions of the great powers, of the major players in the region?</p>
<p class="contents">The entire issue of the presence of foreign troops in the Southern Caucasus should find a forum in which it can be discussed. We want to understand whether the control and presence of foreign troops serves to bring stability or if it spreads further uncertainties. Calling on the Council and the Commission to organise, with the United Nations, the OSCE and the other actors, sending a mission to maintain peace in the region and to re-launch the peace process, is part of our desire for stability. The process of break-up has, however, reached the point where it is difficult to envisage what type of coexistence could be established, especially – and I repeat – if there is no collaboration between the major powers. Every effort must, however, be made, including those which seem somewhat abstract, in the hope of creating a starting point for the new governing group that has inherited a situation that is difficult from all points of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The specific obstacles in the tense relationship between Moscow and Tbilisi are sufficiently known. Russia’s maintenance of a military presence on Georgian territory and its protection of Georgian regions threaten to break the political unity of this Trans-Caucasian republic permanently.</p>
<p class="contents">The first obstacle is the international undertaking of 1999, by which the Kremlin committed itself to withdrawing its military presence from Georgia. The second obstacle was highlighted once again at the end of November during the much-publicised consultation in Moscow between Russia and representatives of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria. The present resolution makes a clear stand against the said violations of Georgia’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. This House expects the same political clarity from the Council and Commission in the relations between the European Union and Russia. Meanwhile, the interim government in Georgia has the mammoth task of getting their country back on the right track constitutionally speaking. This also calls for attention on the part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, one and a half million of Georgia’s inhabitants have been obliged to leave their country in a gigantic brain drain. This centuries-old nation must surely have a prospect other than that of such a sad diaspora. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After a long tradition of having been the first colony in tsarist Russia, and then having been the birthplace of Stalin, and finally Eduard Shevardnadze, there now comes democracy. It is reminiscent of the Central Europe of previous years: Romania after Ceaucescu, or Serbia after Milosevic. Many European countries will be inclined to think: this is a nearby region, a Christian region, together with Ar menia, but at the same time a long way away from us, only accessible from the Black Sea, via Turkey or via Russia. What relations could the European Union have in the future with that country? In addition, Mr Belder has already drawn attention to the problem of its national minorities, and Abkhazia, in particular, has been a Georgian breakaway region for a long time now.</p>
<p class="contents">The inhabitants of South Ossetia are actually unhappy about being part of Georgia, and in Ajaria people are supporting a leader who would gladly have remained loyal to Eduard Shevardnadze. A great many unresolved problems remain, therefore, and I think that, if a solution is not found to these internal problems, the democracy that is now able to get off the ground in Georgia will start at a disadvantage. It is very important to work towards this, therefore. In Amendment No 3, my group calls for the EU to ensure that its involvement, which is supposed to make a contribution to democracy, does not lead to interference in Georgia’s domestic politics. We do not believe that the purposes of democracy would be served by the European Union adopting the wrong attitude, putting too much emphasis on forcing together different population groups that have difficulty living together. It will have to be a cautious process, one that is primarily based on the efforts of the peoples of Georgia themselves: the Georgians as the largest group, but also taking account of the three large national minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there is the terrible economic situation. We all know, partly from comparison with other countries, that if the situation remains as bad as this, if there is no prospect of an improvement in the economic situation, this will have a very negative impact on the chances of improving the functioning of democracy. We all support this: that is laid down in our resolution. We also know, however, that many people’s perspective is determined primarily by their economic situation, and that the confidence in parliamentary democracy – and that confidence is not so great in Georgia as it is – melts away if there is no improvement in the economic situation. To put it bluntly: without food or heating, democracy soon becomes a luxury. A situation such as this must be avoided at all costs, but it is a great danger, one that is threatening at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">My second great concern is the role of Russia. Of course, Mr Ivanov, the Foreign Minister, played a very positive role in the departure of Mr Shevardnadze, for which he deserves great credit. At the same time, however, we know that the influence of Russia in Georgia is very bad in the long term from a structural point of view. Firstly, there are the military bases, which Russia said years ago it was going to remove. That did not happen, which is a very bad thing. In recent years, of course, there has been Russia’s support for the three separatist movements in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Ajaria. That assistance is military, but the assistance is often much more subtle: making it easier for the people from the regions to travel to Russia or to adopt Russian citizenship, for example. This has to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to change the role of Russia, assistance is required from the European Union. Georgia cannot do it alone. One way is for us to offer mediation. I am very much in favour of this: that is also laid down in the resolution. If Europe can play a role in this, it must be sure to do so. I am afraid that that will not suffice, however. I think that it will also be up to us to exert pressure on Russia to put an end to the negative role it is playing in Georgia. To be honest, the European Union is not good at this. The example of Chechnya shows that we often handle Russia with kid gloves when it comes to their conduct in the northern Caucasus, and now likewise in the southern Caucasus. This really has to stop. Supporting the elections is a very good thing, but it is just a drop in the ocean. Nor will our help in boosting the economy there suffice – which is also essential for the preservation of confidence in democracy – if, at the same time, we know that the great neighbour to the north, Russia, is very actively engaged in pulling the country apart into three pieces. The European Union must play a pioneering role in order to prevent this: if possible, by convincing Russia; but if necessary, by seeking confrontation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With their peaceful and thankfully bloodless revolution, the Georgian people have gained a hearing and all our respect. That is convincing evidence that despite their grave economic plight, the people of Georgia are yearning for democracy. There is now a chance for a new beginning. Properly conducted elections are a prerequisite for stability and development in Georgia. A great deal of time has been wasted since the transforming events of twelve years ago. Surprisingly, Georgia’s state coffers are almost empty. Georgia has received financial assistance not only from the European Union but from many other parts of the world, but its people have gone away empty-handed. The Georgian people have high expectations of their new President. He must create a democratic order but also provide for the people’s basic needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament for making it possible for our special delegation to travel to the elections. In this way, we are also showing that in the European Parliament, we take the task of supporting peaceful development in Georgia very seriously. At the Brussels Summit, the European Union’s Heads of State or Government have just reaffirmed, yet again, the Union’s determination to build a balanced and reciprocal strategic partnership with Russia, based on the values of the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms and a free market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The national governments and the European Parliament, however, must accept that this kind of strategic partnership is only possible with states that honour their pledges. Russia has failed to fulfil the international commitments it made to Georgia in Istanbul in 1999 and by adopting this position, it has greatly obstructed democratic development in an already fragile region in the past. I can only hope that Russia will in future support constructive negotiations in all parts of Georgia, as agreed in the OSCE accords in 1999, and will not further impede democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia plays a key role in Georgia and the entire Southern Caucasus. We in the European Parliament must address this issue when we deliberate our relations with Russia. However, our task now is to help Georgia overcome its crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More than ever before, Georgia has the opportunity to turn towards the EU and strengthen the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Georgia is a strategic gateway to Central Asia, but we must make the Georgian people aware that their future should not merely consist of a choice between two influences, Russia or the US. The recent political crisis is a strong signal from the people of Georgia, who have shown their determination to fight for democracy, while the financial and economic situation in the country is catastrophic and corruption is on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ahead of the planned presidential elections, which are due to take place on 4 January 2004, the EU must offer effective political, financial and technical assistance to the new Georgian authorities, in order to help them to adopt the reforms needed to stabilise the situation in the country and to allow the forthcoming elections to take place peacefully. It is also our duty to offer our help in at last finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The country’s financial and economic situation must also be subject to far-reaching reforms aimed at eliminating corruption. The EU has already provided an overall financial aid package of around EUR 342 million in the form of grants. Now more than ever, the process of economic reform must continue to enjoy EU support, so as to restore an atmosphere that is conducive to foreign and local investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the EU must redouble its efforts to encourage democratic institutions and to support and promote independent media, through aid and development programmes, such as Tacis. Georgia must be made aware that it can receive generous support from the EU, enabling it to recover some stability, in an atmosphere of democracy and transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there anyone among us who does not believe that the round of enlargement covering the ten countries that are to join the EU next year is the main reason why, with regard to at least some of them, they are not sinking into totalitarianism or chaos, into a situation in which Georgia almost found itself? I believe that this is really what Europe today is about. Yes, we feel down, the Brussels summit did not turn out as we would have wished, but I believe that in historical terms enlargement has always been a success; it is proof that the EU has succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem facing Georgia today is no different. Georgia used to be richer than most of the Soviet Union, whereas today it is the poorest region. If six years ago we had offered Georgia the chance to join, it would undoubtedly be in the same situation as the countries that are soon to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not follow Mr Meijer’s example. He is not only doing a disservice to us, but also to Mr Shevardnadze, a man who has his faults, but who also achieved some good things, and who is certainly no Ceaucescu or Milosevic. The issue, Mrs De Sarnez, is not the alternative that we can offer to the potential choice faced by the Georgians between Russia and the US; what we can offer is a choice between membership of the EU and chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what is at stake. It is not, Mr Volcic, a matter of nostalgia for a bipolar, US-Soviet world. The challenge for us, the EU, is to create an alternative for these countries of the Transcaucasus. So I hope that we have seen the last of the unspoken comments and an inability to think beyond the Black Sea. The Council has never even considered the matter, as it said again yesterday evening. Georgia must be placed immediately on the list of candidate countries, so as to afford it the opportunity, as we did with the Baltic States, and with the countries of Central Europe, to build a path to stability, development and democracy, by offering EU membership within eight to ten years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then after the First World War, Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence during what we might term the ‘Caucasian Spring’, a fact that is generally forgotten. It was brought to an end by Lenin, who failed to uphold his own principles of nationality. Then a strong liberation movement emerged at the end of the Soviet era. We should not forget that the liberation movement in the Soviet Union began very vigorously and very early in Georgia. We ourselves have a great deal to thank Georgia for when it came to the fall of the Iron Curtain. Then President Gamsakhurdia was murdered. This was followed by civil unrest, the separatist movements and the Shevardnadze era, which has now come to an end – thankfully without bloodshed. The country is now at a stage where it finally has a chance to establish a system genuinely rooted in freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that after many decades of foreign tutelage, the country has the opportunity at last to become what it once was in history, namely a genuinely independent and peaceful factor in a very important and very dangerous region. That is why we must push to ensure that Russia upholds the binding commitments it made to the OSCE in 1999. We often demand, very arrogantly, of small states that they honour commitments that have often been imposed upon them, so we must be rigorous in demanding that when a major power enters into such commitments voluntarily, it is scrupulous in upholding them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schleicher is quite right, in my view, to say that Russia cannot be our partner if it fails to fulfil its commitments on this key issue. We see that there are other powers as well which, for geostrategic and energy reasons, are aspiring to establish a particular dominance in the region. That is why it is our obligation, as Europeans, to stabilise Georgia as our partner, although I would not go as far as Mr Dupuis, who is demanding full membership. Georgia is a country with a great European tradition. It is our valued partner and it can be a beacon of freedom in an extremely dangerous region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Georgia now has a unique opportunity to leave the past behind in order to build a better future for all its citizens, one that is founded upon a clear commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to the market economy. One must not, however, underestimate the challenges it will face, but, in view of Georgia’s commitment to reform, Commissioner Patten wanted me to assure your House of the EU’s willingness to do everything in its power to help Georgia meet these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The most immediate challenge facing Georgia comes in the form of the democratic presidential elections to be held on 4 January, to be followed later by parliamentary elections in accordance with the undertakings given to the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The Commission intends to grant Georgia a package of at most EUR 2 million to support preparations for these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia is also facing very serious difficulties with its budget. The Commission has just directed that the sum of EUR 5 million be paid under a fast-track procedure for a food safety programme in order to enable Georgia to meet its most urgent needs during the winter months.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that democratic elections have been held, the Commission will support the newly-elected president, who is determined to introduce reforms. We have re-examined our strategy in relation to Georgia, which provides a sound basis on which the country may be helped to tackle the priority areas in which reforms are indispensable. Action to combat the scourge of corruption will assume crucial importance for any programme of reform to bear lasting fruit. The Commission will consider the means whereby substantial resources may be mobilised in support of such reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to stress that the Commission is already, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, providing aid to Georgia to help ensure that these are respected. Alongside the Council of Europe, we are also working to strengthen local democracy and the machinery for protecting human rights. We will, over the coming months, be giving consideration to whether or not we need to change what we are doing in the light of recent political changes in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has for a long time demonstrated its support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The endeavour to resolve the conflicts that are rending the country asunder, bringing long-term stability to this region of the South Caucasus, and establishing good working relations, founded upon mutual respect, between Georgia and Russia, will play an important part in this. For its part, the European Union is examining new ways of giving support that will resolve conflicts or prevent them arising in the first place. The Commission will stand ready to support rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, in close collaboration with the EU’s special representative for the South Caucasus, Mr Heikki Talvitie, making resolute efforts at devising a broader policy for the European Union in its relations with the South Caucasus region, in which process our efforts at providing support for Georgia are both a major element, and, at this present time, crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
