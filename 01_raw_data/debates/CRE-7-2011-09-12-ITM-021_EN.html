<p class="contents">The fact is that raw materials policy is one of the major challenges for industrial policy. However, it is also one of our greatest opportunities. This is a subject that has become very close to my heart in the last 18 months. I am certain that a very prudent yet ambitious innovation strategy will bring us great success, if we focus our efforts there. Resource efficiency, re-use, recycling or even substitution – these are the key strategies available to us and we should base our future competitiveness on precisely this strategy of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: setting targets without considering the instruments available to achieve them is rarely a recipe for getting results. That is why it is particularly important that we should think hard about the question and reach specific agreements among ourselves about how to organise cooperation between the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission and genuinely assume responsibility. Effective governance is the key here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mineral raw materials are at least as important as oil or gas or other natural energy sources, however they are not given the same attention in European cooperation; this is something that has to change.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we have indicated a whole series of instruments that will enable us to strengthen governance. We propose a risk radar. We want the Commission to update its list of critical raw materials and to analyse the supply chains. We want a study to be carried out on critical raw materials, such as lithium, which are not currently on the list, but which are of strategic importance. We propose establishing a competency network for rare earths. We are very keen that the initiative of the Commission for an innovation partnership on raw materials efficiency, which has been blocked by some Member States, should finally be given a chance. We want a high-level task force to be established to give strategic coherence to the activities of the various players – the Directorates General, the Joint Research Centre, the European Environment Agency, the European External Action Service and others. We want a raw materials road map by 2050 and an annual progress report for the European Parliament, and we also want to see the laws that we have in the area of recycling, for example in relation to electronic waste, actually being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this report also deals with the external aspects of raw materials policy. The principle I apply here is that we should pursue a reliable strategy of foreign cooperation both with poorer resource-rich countries – in Africa for example – and with strong resource-rich countries. The point here is that Europe, which imports more raw materials per capita than any other region of the world, should take a responsible stance with a raw materials strategy based on cooperation. This means, for example, that when deciding on investments for the extraction of resources in third countries, the European Investment Bank and the Commission should check whether such projects are embedded in a strategy to combat poverty and promote development. Accordingly, transparency laws should be drafted in line with the US model of the Dodd-Frank Act or the publish-what-you-pay principle. This means that development policy is not made subservient to raw materials interests, but rather accepts the raw materials sovereignty of our partners, while at the same time intervening to prevent distortion and promoting cooperation in the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain that, on this basis, the EU will be able to make a very positive contribution to international raw materials governance in the many international bodies that already exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio Tajani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to thank Mr Bütikofer for the text he has drafted, and this is not just a matter of form. I also wish to thank all the Members who have tabled opinions on the report, because the result achieved is an extremely positive one in my view, and is in harmony with the European Commission’s efforts to strategically address the extremely important issue of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I say that this report has convinced me, and why do I say that it is in harmony with the European Commission’s strategy and hence strengthens, politically, the joint action and cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in this extremely important area? Firstly, because the report considers the problems and the opportunities that we may have from every angle; secondly, because it strikes the right balance between the various political options; and thirdly, because it contains practical and extremely interesting suggestions and recommendations that contribute to the development and improvement of a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I said at the beginning of my speech that I felt that cooperation between Parliament and the Commission was crucial. We have been working for several months now with Mr Bütikofer, and with many other Members, too; I am thinking of the ‘raw materials club’, which was the initiative of Members from various political groups – Mr Rübig, Mr Florenz, Ms Merkies, Mr Bütikofer – and of the recent proposal by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to launch a pilot project in 2012 aimed at the creation of a network of experts on rare earths. I think that this proposal could also make an excellent contribution to the future partnership on raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear why the political involvement of all the institutions has become crucial; your report explains this point very well. One piece of information that I feel is particularly significant and which struck me this morning when I was reading the report on my way from Munich to Strasbourg is the part that helps give us a concrete idea of how the supply of raw materials is hindering the competitiveness of our businesses; it struck me when Mr Bütikofer wrote that raw material cost as a proportion of total production cost is far higher than workers’ payroll cost and that the trend is for an increase in all sectors in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus now on a few fundamental aspects of this strategy, the three different pillars of which – supply outside the EU, supply within the EU, and resource efficiency, recycling and substitution – are, in my view, vital elements, and I am convinced as well as pleased that Parliament agrees with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation is vital in order to make progress in each of the sectors covered by the EU raw materials strategy, which has to include the entire value chain, from prospecting to extraction, processing, recycling and substitution, in order to be complete.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the launch of an innovation partnership on raw materials may also act as an important incentive to help ensure that real progress is made. I am even more optimistic than Mr Bütikofer: it seems to me that, more than resistance, the reservations and misgivings of some Member States have now been overcome, not least because the Competitiveness Council has given the green light to this initiative of ours, and so I believe that the important thing now is to focus on how we can work together on this innovation partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The other topic that was addressed in the report, and also in Mr Bütikofer’s speech, concerns raw materials diplomacy: ongoing attention must be paid to these materials in our international relations, both from a trade point of view and from the point of view of other aspects. Together with the United States and Japan, we have taken the first steps towards closer cooperation in this sector. As part of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy and the Joint Africa-EU Action Plan, the African Union and the European Union have pledged to work towards a coherent approach to the development of raw materials extraction activities with the aim of supporting Africa’s capabilities at national, subregional and continental level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Africa-EU High Level Conference on Raw Materials, to be held on 1 December, will provide the political impetus needed to take this partnership forward. Russia and Latin America are two other fronts on which we are working – I will be in Moscow at the end of October, and I was in Chile in June. We have signed an agreement with Chile, and I am endeavouring to have it signed by Argentina and Brazil in the next few months, before the end of the year. Let us remember that Chile is one of the main producers of lithium, and very high-quality lithium at that – it is perhaps the best in the world. The country’s relationship with the European Union has been welcomed very enthusiastically, as was also highlighted by a meeting held with the Republic’s president and its entire government, precisely in order to emphasise the importance of the strategic raw materials agreement with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards sustainability, we must pursue our efforts to reconcile extraction activities with high environmental protection requirements. Clearly, in order to reconcile these elements, we need to base our efforts on a research and innovation policy, but success in this area also depends on the way in which we formulate policies on access to earths and on the promotion of environmentally friendly mineral extraction activities. For this reason, I am working extremely closely with Commissioner Potočnik also. This is an area that largely comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States, but the Commission may be able to act as a facilitator. Of course the ultimate responsibility lies, I repeat, with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, next week we shall be adopting the flagship initiative on resource efficiency, in which various practical solutions will be provided, particularly regarding recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">The examples that I mentioned concern only a few cases, and I wish to tell Parliament that I am also working hard with the Swedish Government, which held an important meeting on raw materials extraction in the Barents Sea in this very Chamber a few months ago, before the summer recess. I am in contact with Minister Bildt and I will be travelling to Sweden so that we can work together. I also wish to inform Parliament that I have also met with the new prime minister of Greenland, and we are already working on my visit to Greenland to address the issue of raw materials. There is a positive desire on the part of Greenland to work with us to address and explore a raw materials strategy that will apply in the long term also.</p>
<p class="contents">That is everything that we are doing, and I shall say it again: I consider this strong relationship with Parliament to be extremely important. It will play a crucial role, especially when it comes to the development of a robust strategy that provides practical solutions for industry without causing environmental damage. I apologise if I have taken longer than planned, but this is such an important issue that it merits an in-depth debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As standing rapporteur for Policy Coherence for Development I am very, very grateful to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for taking on board many of the proposals of the Committee on Development. As Mr Bütikofer has already stated, the raw materials issue is extremely important: the United Nations forecasts a growth in demand for raw materials of 300% by 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this discussion is also important in the context of coherent development policy. Let me give you an example: dubious accounting practices among international raw materials companies and inadequate contracts with these companies mean that developing countries are losing an estimated USD 80 to 160 billion every year. Compare this with the development aid provided by the European Union, which amounts to 8 billion per year. In this context, our aid is like a drop of water hitting a sizzling hot stone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important that the report should refer clearly to transparency initiatives like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Because these initiatives can only bear fruit in the long term, I welcome offers of concrete help as part of the Joint Africa EU Strategy Action Plan 2011-2013, for example with the negotiation of contracts with raw materials companies. According to estimates, every single euro spent in this way generates added value of 10 euro and I believe we can say that this would be more effective aid than cosmetic measures taken at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Tajani, raw materials policy is essential to the development of European industry. The trade dimension is decisive, which is why I believe it is right for raw materials policy to be anchored in an international context from the perspective of industrial policy in Europe. A number of points are key here: If we intend to secure our supply of raw materials in the world by means of partnership agreements, we can only do this by ensuring that the businesses that extract these raw materials also conduct themselves in a reasonable way. It is unacceptable for European businesses to evade tax or for workers to be required to work under inhuman conditions. That is why it is clear that if we intend to mine raw materials, then businesses need to comply with clear social and environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also ensure that the raw materials that we use do not come from crisis regions and are not used to finance groups who use the money earned from raw materials to fund civil war. We need an international certification system for the extraction of raw materials and for tracing trade, so that we can tell where raw materials come from. By the way, excellent footprints can be found for raw materials everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must ensure that we do not export raw materials illegally. In our own interests, we need to close any loopholes in our legislation – this last remark is addressed to Mr Florenz. However, we also need to improve controls. The system will never work if a single individual is to be required to ensure controls in a large European port. Exports need closer monitoring and it is necessary to ensure that monopolistic and oligopolistic structures in raw materials trade are eliminated. The good news, Commissioner, is that the Commission is moving in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</span>. <span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, thank you for the document in front of us and for your strategies. Thank you to the other Members, too, for all your input. I am of the view that we have a very useful document here. To be honest, I think that we could take this a lot further. It is a very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the current economic and financial crisis, what tends to get overlooked is the fact that the next crisis is already looming in its wake, a crisis that we could prevent right now, if we had the right strategy. I am talking about the shortage of raw materials – things which all the emerging economies would obviously also like to get their hands on – a shortage which is already putting our future growth, once this crisis is over, under pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">What really pleases me is that this report pays a lot of attention to this weakness of the EU, to the fact that we are currently so dependent. It is also good that we are focusing on our own strengths. How are we dealing with our own waste? What else could we still do internally, within Europe? The report contains a call for innovation, which is essential if we are to succeed in keeping raw materials within our own territory and reprocessing them.</p>
<p class="contents">The only problem is that we need to flesh out what exactly we mean by innovation, because the definition in the report is not yet concrete enough. What exactly do we mean by that? Where is the actual paradigm shift that Europe has been clamouring for, as a response, certainly, to this financial and economic crisis and as a response to the many different ways in which we are dependent? We need a behavioural change, a shift in industry and amongst the citizens themselves. How can we achieve that? We need a totally different economic model. I am not talking here about just the governance structures of banks or governments. No, what I actually mean is substantial intervention in the economy: for example, a ‘lease’ society, where all products automatically come back to us in another form. This would, however, be a genuine redistribution of our burden: it would, for example, provide that extra little incentive that is necessary to get us to purchase higher-quality, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly products; much more stringent ecodesign guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be particularly pleased with what you have to say if you say that we have to do everything in a way which shows respect for nature. Because that is really important. We tend to opt far too quickly for virgin land, those nature reserves that could still be used for mining, but who says that urban dwellers cannot provide for themselves from the goldmines in their cities? Yes, we are already living on top of a goldmine of waste, and that could turn out to be our urban mine. We could be living on top of a source of something that we could use. Let us therefore first of all concentrate on those areas, and not just on virgin land.</p>
<p class="contents">All of you have come up with sound proposals <span class="bold">−</span> proposals which I, indeed, hope will become a reality, such as the quality mark, the chain of custody, the concept of ultimate responsibility, proper social labelling, paying more attention to illegal shipments out of Europe and, above all, a great deal of innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are facing a series of problems relating to agricultural raw materials, whether we are talking not only about the extreme volatility of markets and prices and the dwindling global food stocks, but also about the shortcomings in the food chain. We must also bear in mind that the European Union’s strategy needs to take into account factors such as the export barriers. With this in mind, these issues have to be clarified beforehand within the World Trade Organisation.</p>

<p class="contents">For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have already said that the efficient use of resources, recycling and urban mining are extremely important investments in jobs and growth and in the protection and management of our environment, but with innovation, a modern way of thinking and a modern form of action as the tools to achieve this. At the same time, I would like to highlight a completely different perspective that is crucial to the electorate that I represent in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing I did when Parliament began working on issues relating to raw materials was to travel to one of the main centres for raw materials in Europe, namely Norrbotten in northern Sweden. There I met the real experts who know what raw materials mean for growth, jobs and industrial development. I spoke to researchers, industry representatives and the trade unions. They described how this age-old sector is now blooming once again, how new mines are being opened and old mines revived, how prospecting is being carried out, techniques are being developed and quality is being improved. This is a result of global demand increasing once again. Globalisation has quite simply returned to Europe. Demand is coming from the world outside Europe, while at the same time we need to succeed in supplying our own industry. This is extremely exciting. I have to say to Commissioner Tajani that there is no need to go to Greenland. We have the whole of northern Europe, where there is a great deal of advanced technology, research, high-quality raw materials and a working environment that is also very good for those who work in this section of the industry. I believe that we can do a great deal more of this without needing to look further north to start with.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see the raw materials strategy as recognition by the EU of the crucial role that northern Europe plays with regard to industrial development and prosperity. That is important.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one of the most important lessons I learned from my visit to northern Sweden was the importance of a well-functioning infrastructure, both for regions rich in raw materials and for centres of industry. That is vital for effective and green growth.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report, Parliament is demanding that the new guidelines for the EU’s Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) infrastructure programme take account of the need to link raw material resources to industrial centres. The Commission must listen to this and come up with specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue is of course the prospects for development, which several other speakers have already mentioned. A key starting point is that extraction of raw materials and trade with countries outside the EU must, of course, be based on equal partnerships. We must not contribute to a development that involves supporting a regression to neocolonial times, a return to the old colonial era. That is a route we must not go down. We do not need to, as there are enormous riches and many good partnerships for us to enter into. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we Europeans find ourselves in an increasingly globalised world, we face the dual challenge of securing European prosperity and fighting climate change. Over the coming decades we need to restructure the European economy in order to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth for the whole continent. These are challenges acknowledged in the EU's jobs and growth strategy, the 2020 Strategy, and they should also be at the forefront of a successful raw materials strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges should not be underestimated. According to some estimates, investment needs for transport, energy, ICT and other sectors will amount to EUR 4 000 billion up to 2050. To achieve this, a secure supply of raw materials is the key to a future where Europe leads the world in green technology. As economies go greener they also increasingly compete for the same key raw materials, many of which we must import from competing world powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The raw materials strategy needs to be connected – or more connected – to other important European policies, for example on industry, research, trade, transport and sustainable economic growth. Especially at this time of crisis, we need real growth- orientated reforms based on encouraging free trade. Tying a raw materials strategy based on free trade closer to other EU policies will enhance access to raw materials for European companies as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from being green and trade-oriented, the EU raw materials strategy must also ensure that both developed and developing countries can benefit from the sustainable supply of materials. It is crucial that the capacity of developing countries is strengthened using the ‘Aid for Trade’ mechanism. Special attention must be paid to fragile states and post-conflict situations in order to ensure that raw materials are not used to escalate or finance conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs actions aimed at innovation and eliminating trade barriers in third countries, not a policy of stockpiling rare and critical raw materials while undermining democracy abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should also take advantage of the materials that we have here. Contrary to frequent assertions, Europe is still rich in natural resources and, with its minerals, metals and forests, Northern Europe in particular has the potential to meet many of the EU’s raw material needs in a sustainable way, provided there is transport.</p>
<p class="contents">If sound and strategic management of our own resources can be coupled with real reform of the internal market, we will be well on our way to being a competitive player in tomorrow’s global green economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, also, Commissioner Tajani, for your comments on the report. It seems that we all agree. This is a great strategy for safeguarding raw materials. Perhaps I should be being a little more critical, because, if I compare this report to the Commission’s original report, I, in fact, see that there are considerable discrepancies between the two. I am pleased that Mr Tajani is now happy with the European Parliament’s report, but what we are dealing with here is a different strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">When I read the Commission’s report, what it mainly focused on was fighting China for raw materials and bringing them into Europe as soon as possible. If that failed, we were to quickly move onto exploiting European mines. Number three was that, oh yes, we should be dealing with raw materials slightly more efficiently. That is precisely the wrong order in which to do things, and this report makes that obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we ourselves must be much more efficient in dealing with our natural resources. A very simple example is recycling. If we mine one tonne, we will probably find, on average, five grams of gold. However, if we look at one tonne of electronic waste, there is 150 grams of gold to be found there. That is a much more intelligent, much cheaper and more efficient way of sourcing our raw materials. Recycling is also – as you, as the Commissioner of Industry must know – a branch of European industry which needs to be promoted, here in Europe, above anywhere else. Reusing our own resources that have already been on the market. <span class="italic">That</span> is a clever policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really have to go on mining, let us avoid Natura 2000 areas completely. This report makes that quite clear. You say that we obviously need to take the environment into account. I want that to be made more stringent. We do not, therefore, want to interfere with Natura 2000 areas, but I do not want Europe to go into the North Pole either. That would at least be a concrete policy, instead of vague words.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if we really have to import raw materials from outside Europe, contact with developing countries would be in order. That is where diplomacy comes in. However, I want to see this policy reflected throughout the Commission, including by the Commissioner for Trade, Mr De Gucht, because a consistent European foreign policy is, unfortunately, still a long way off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I followed this report as shadow rapporteur for the opinion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the debate there quite rightly centred around some very specific areas in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely clear that we need to consider strategies for reducing the use of, and increasing the recycling of, these scarce raw materials, but we also need to make sure that we do not over-complicate the issue. A strategy is a strategy and the title of this report is ‘an effective strategy’. We need to be aware that we could become too prescriptive at this stage. We need to leave our options open whilst agreeing our broad strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Take, for example, urban mining. This is a great concept. I come from a country with a very long history of landfill, and I am sure there is a great deal in there that we could very usefully use, but we need to be careful. Landfill creates greenhouse gases, we all know that; that is why we are trying to avoid it. Old landfills are sealed, they can create noxious gases, sometimes poisonous gases, so we must be very careful before we move forward with this strategy, and we must have good and careful impact assessments in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the issue of stockpiling, referred to here, must be approached with caution. Much of the debate around this subject has centred on the distortions of supply in the market and on speculation – market manipulation. This is all open to debate, but I believe that the last thing we need to do in response to that concern is to talk about stockpiling, because that is a manipulation of the market, and there is absolutely no guarantee – without much further thought and much further examination – that this will take us any further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly, I welcome the report. I thank the rapporteur once again and I look forward to working together on a raw material strategy as the years go by because this is clearly just the beginning of a long road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that these are all positive points, among others, in the report presented to this Chamber. However, I think that we must bear in mind what the Commission is proposing, and I cannot agree in any way with the model being presented, the so-called ‘raw materials diplomacy’.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, together with the proposal to establish a monitoring mechanism at the level of the G8 or the G20, in my view reinforces a division, a new division, or it reinforces the division of the world into industrialised countries with raw material requirements, as we all know – and these are legitimate requirements – on the one hand, and on the other, poor countries that are rich in raw materials, but which do not even have access to them. We know that, in the European industrial context, forces exist which want to ensure the supply of these raw materials by whatever means necessary. This vision of the world is a step backwards, a way of thinking from the past, and Europe should have learnt by now, because we have at least 500 years’ experience in this area. There are therefore no guarantees that the raw materials diplomacy model will not turn into diplomatic blackmail. The developing countries and their populations must have a right to their own resources. I think that we should be talking about a new development model that is more innovative, as has already been mentioned, and that the focus of the European External Action Service must be cooperation and not the diplomacy of business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapid industrial growth in countries in the developing world, especially in Asia and South America, has increased demand for raw materials, precious metals and rare earth elements, increasing their price and restricting their availability for European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">However, large quantities of used industrial products considered as waste, which often contain precious metals or materials which are difficult to obtain from abroad, have long been concentrated in Europe. Therefore, in addition to finding new options for obtaining raw materials, either through trade diplomacy or cooperation in revealing new production capacity, we must, I believe, be more orientated towards exploiting the potential of waste recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">We should no longer consider recyclable industrial waste to be purely worthless contamination.

I believe that the final text does indeed include the parameters which should govern a dynamic EU raw materials strategy for Europe, in terms of development, industry, the environment and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a strategy that will strengthen the potential for growth and the competitiveness of the European Union, that will support and be supported by European industry, that will utilise domestic raw materials with absolute respect for the environment, that will be linked to research and innovation efforts, by creating new jobs and providing a high standard of training for human resources, and that will strengthen the position of the European Union in a volatile international environment, in which competition for access to cheap natural resources is expected to become even stiffer.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the issue of rare earths, which I have repeatedly raised from this tribune. I personally feel justified in persistently raising this issue and repeatedly questioning the European Commission on it. From being a neglected parochial issue of interest to a few specialists, rare earths have become front page news in newspapers and journals. They function as a useful symbol by highlighting the EU’s strategic dependence on raw materials and the need for a decisive, long-term policy in which industrial, research and innovation efforts are supported by clear and balanced international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel justified because, according to its recent announcement, the European Commission endorses our proposal to create strategic reserves of rare earths, in order to help bring about price stability and an uninterrupted supply to green and high-tech European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This may bring with it unjustified economic or political demands. It is, therefore, essential for the Union’s raw materials resources to be managed independently by the Member States and for exploitation of these resources to be efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The acquisition of primary raw materials requires an outlay of energy: in other words, it is possible to determine an energy equivalent of raw materials which is a measure of the efficiency of their use. Fiscal stimulation of raw materials production should be the domain of the local authorities responsible for water, land and geological structures. Full application of the subsidiarity principle and better use of public funds make it possible to exploit raw materials efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s policy of strategic partnership with the Russian Federation is becoming an important factor in making up the shortfall of raw materials of many kinds, not just those needed for energy production. Retrieving secondary raw materials by recycling and the substitution of materials are alternatives of enormous potential and require rational expenditure on research and innovation. A growing trend in EU materials engineering is for raw and processed materials which require heavy expenditures of energy for their production to be substituted more extensively by materials which meet criteria related to their use but which require a lower energy outlay. Examples here are the use of wooden structures in individual construction and high fracture toughness advanced ceramics, which can replace metals in the construction of machines.</p>
<p class="contents">The pursuit of an ambitious energy and climate policy is impossible without access to raw materials which can be used for the production of other materials with special physical and chemical properties, such as rare earth metals for super magnets, for example, and also copper, which is a good conductor of heat and electricity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Tajani, you have given a very clear signal this evening, which gives us hope. After all, we were disappointed with the presentation of the Commission’s strategy in the beginning. However, the raw materials strategy is a vital ingredient for business, employment and jobs here in the European Union. That is why a coherent strategy is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we need the three pillars: security for our sources of raw materials, a recycling strategy, including greater efficiencies, as well as a joint approach so that partnerships can be established with the main raw materials suppliers of this world. The amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe focus on the idea that we should include more members of the scientific community in this strategy because there are many modern techniques for using raw materials found on the sea bed in the world’s oceans that still need to be researched and developed. This is precisely where Europeans have something to offer raw materials suppliers in developing countries and emerging economies as part of a common raw materials strategy. As liberals we believe it is important to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises require our particular help. Big business can secure raw materials for itself, while small and medium-sized enterprises need a joint strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our call on you: let us work together to unite the Member States under the umbrella of the EU and establish long-term partnerships with the countries with the raw materials. The aim of the raw materials strategy must be to bring economic policy, environmental policy and international trade, together with development policy, under one roof. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to avoid situations like the one in 2007-2008, when a lot of raw materials reached exorbitant prices or were not even available, essentially because of the speculation that affected the raw materials market. We need to create the necessary conditions so that the physical market is not overshadowed by the financial derivatives market, the volume of which has grown disproportionately over the years. However, in order to protect the market from speculation that can make raw materials inaccessible, it is not enough just to talk about transparency in general; we need to go much further.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, it is necessary to ensure reliable availability of official information on physical flows and stocks of raw materials so that there will be no risk of an interruption in supplies. This again raises the need for better knowledge of the geological resources in Europe and the exploitation of those resources, including in underwater areas, on the seabed. It is also necessary to ensure, however, that those resources are exploited in compliance with social and environmental rules, and that the sovereignty and interests of the states and peoples where those resources are located are respected. That will include the development of cooperation with producer third countries, in particular Africa, thus avoiding any new forms of colonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also want to emphasise the importance of development and the proper use and recycling of materials, as fully as possible, either because of the scarcity of many primary raw materials, or in order to manage secondary sources, or to reduce negative end-of-life impacts and avoid polluting waste, or to create indigenous industrial opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Commission will take account of this range of matters for an effective strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, the EU should ensure transparency, stability and a certain degree of market regulation, and it should always consider the question of how far regulation should go.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we need to properly tap the potential of recycling and of the diversification of sources. Sustainability is the keyword here. European companies have to pursue a responsible purchasing policy, and the European Union must ensure good framework conditions. When EU legislation on conflict minerals is being proposed, everything must be done to prevent the ordinary people affected by mineral extraction from suffering as a result. The demand for raw materials should be met in a fashion that does justice to the countries of origin in terms of human rights, the environment, fair and open trade and market stability. It goes without saying that I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing, today, with an extremely important subject – the raw materials which are needed by Europe and the world. At the moment we are talking about an effective strategy which will establish new courses of action both for the consumption and the sustainable use of our resources and raw materials. Natural resources are currently the basis of the operation of all economies, both at world and at European level, and they affect the quality of our lives. Therefore, we must ensure that the model of consumption and production which is accepted today is a standard which can be used, too, by future generations, so that it will not be the case that we simply use resources but leave little to those who come after us. The high consumption of raw materials is also an obstruction to European economies in terms of being competitive, low on emissions and up to date. This is why it is so important to deal with wastes, which contain a large amount of very valuable raw materials. Moving to a green economy will require significant spending, but will also require social and economic changes. It is also essential to ensure integrated action on the development of modern technologies, the power industry, industry in general and environmental protection. Policies and strategies must be focused as soon as possible on limiting emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Therefore it is important that we prepare a strategy which is based on what we have received from our fathers and which passes that legacy on to the generations which come after us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe, and the world in general, need an effective raw materials strategy, something which has been said here on numerous occasions, to ensure that we have adequate natural resources, and, especially, critical raw materials, now and for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Right at the start, I want to say that I am very pleased that, in this report, the committee has given very close attention to northern Europe, where there are substantial deposits of ores and minerals, and huge areas of forest. Northern Europe, and the Arctic regions in particular, have huge potential and a major role to play in making raw materials available, both now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be good if the Commission did more to investigate the extent to which we can exploit these European mineral deposits and realised that their sustainable exploitation would reduce the need to import our raw materials from third countries. It needs to be realised that the huge potential that the Arctic regions, in particular, offer in terms of rare earth elements, for example, may in future reduce our dependence on imported minerals.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also deals with taxes on minerals, and I am very pleased that the committee has adopted a negative position on the taxation of mineral resources. As stated in the report, in this case tax is not an adequate fiscal tool for increasing resource efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of forests, in particular, as future sources of raw materials and energy. I am rather disappointed that this report does not deal with the matter of forests in any comprehensive way, because forests offer a lot of potential, and the forest sector will also be crucially important in the future green economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to move the debate in a more practical direction, so I will concentrate on one particular raw material: phosphate. Phosphate is important for crop growth. However, in 50 to 90 years’ time, world phosphate reserves will be completely exhausted. At around the same time, the world population will increase to 9 billion; these are people who will also want to eat.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we could just carry on talking about this, but we could also take action, for example by taking steps, here in the European Union, to encourage manure fermentation. That will, first of all, provide us with renewable energy, secondly, reduce the environmental impact and, thirdly, it will yield as an end-product a valuable mineral concentrate, also known as digestate, which can replace artificial fertilisers and, therefore, phosphate. To my mind, that is a win-win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">You could encourage this innovation by backing such projects, for example through the Structural Funds, rural policy or any ‘green’ element of the new common agricultural policy. You could also do this by categorising the mineral concentrate as a substitute fertiliser and not as a primary fertiliser, as is currently the case. This is a technical story, but this example of phosphate shows that an effective raw materials strategy will only stand a chance if words can be translated into concrete actions, technical though they might sometimes be. I hope that the Commissioner is prepared to do something that specific and I look forward to hearing from him whether he will, indeed, take these steps in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is totally dependent on raw material imports. Indeed, the demand for raw materials will be determined by future developments in the emerging economies and by the rapid spread of the relevant technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Transactions involving raw materials and rare earths are carried out worldwide, with the markets for certain raw materials and rare earths being less transparent and generating very low transaction volumes compared with those for other materials. Rare earths are used in the manufacture of monitors, mobile phones and other devices in daily use. They are vital to the manufacture of permanent magnets used in wind turbines, as well as to electric vehicles, car catalytic converters, PCBs, fibre optics and high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, rare earths have a key role to play in the European Union’s economy becoming eco-efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission and Member States to develop, as part of the forthcoming research framework programme, a programme promoting research and innovation in the area of new materials which could replace, in the future, the current raw materials obtained from resources in short supply. At the same time, I should stress the need for investments in the recycling of raw materials and rare earths as the processes for mining, refining and recycling them have severe consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the European Union to establish fruitful partnerships with countries rich in resources, such as those in North America, Australasia, Asia and the Mercosur region. I urge the European Union to support developing countries which are rich in resources, like India and Brazil. As a member of the EU-Mercosur Delegation, I must mention the Fifth EU-Brazil Summit, which will take place on 4 October in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The availability of raw materials and rare earths is vital to the European Union’s industrial development. This is why we are asking the Commission to ensure that the recommendations made in this report are implemented via concrete actions taken by the Commission and Member States. Finally, we urge the Commission to update the list of raw materials on a regular basis so that we can keep abreast of market and technology developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was very pleased by it. I believe that this report will mean that the Commission will act on the problem of awareness experienced here in Europe. We all know how long we have had to wait for this report. This certainly had nothing to do with Mr Tajani, but rather those around him.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received information from the last meeting of the Council (environment) indicating that the Commissioner presented the raw materials strategy and that this report received unanimous verbal support. However, there was no sign of such solidarity when it came to item 2 on the agenda, the Electronic Waste Directive, which aimed to define standards and to implement the necessary steps and to set these down in this directive. This was an unmitigated disaster. The Council was unable to reach agreement with the Commission, something that happens relatively rarely, and I am very pleased that Commissioner Potočnik held out against this.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that this report can get things moving again in this area. After all, even if the climate problem is only half as serious as we have heard, we still need highly innovative continents like Europe to develop high-tech solutions. This requires the processing of valuable raw materials that we can also sell worldwide. I therefore believe that the three-pillar approach proposed by the Commission cannot be implemented on a successive basis – and here I differ with one or two of my colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but that we must implement all three together. If some people want to depict raw materials diplomacy in a negative light, it is up to them. My concern is that we should also deal in an upright way with developing countries, something we have failed to do in the last 20 to 30 years. We should forge alliances there so that our export and import opportunities can be expanded, so that we can react in a concerted way, so that we can find a way to behave, so that the regions in which we extract ores also benefit, enabling them to build schools with the profits, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is an issue that applies within the Community. There are huge opportunities for European industry here, because the issue at stake is the substitution of raw materials such as copper, which we currently take for granted. I am convinced that in the future there will be no more copper water pipes and that the chemicals industry will provide us with new pipes. The potential for industry is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">As a farmer myself, I naturally cannot ignore the issue of the Fauna, Flora and Habitats Directive. The FFH Directive is all well and good, but we should not get carried away. The FFH Directive should be seen as an instrument for protecting the environment. My family has been protecting the environment for 300 years without ever needing such directives. However, if the FFH Directive becomes a weapon against raw materials policy, then things will start to get serious and we must make a reasonable response in resisting this together.</p>
<p class="contents">The third pillar, which has already been mentioned by many people is the question of what we are doing in Europe. Recycling policy and efficiency policy are the golden rule – let us start with this right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warmly welcome Mr Bütikofer’s excellent report, because the issue of what will happen to natural resources, including raw materials, is one of the biggest challenges for Europe in the 21st century. The Bütikofer report has got to the crux of the matter, namely that we really need to focus attention on waste recycling. This can be seen not only with regard to raw materials, but also in the case of water. Israel recycles 75%, whereas in Europe the highest rate is in Spain: 25%. I would like to point out, however, that we should have no illusions where waste recycling is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">When the red sludge spill took place in Hungary, it was a disaster. In the aftermath, scientists got together to try to find ways of recycling or reusing the red sludge waste reservoirs. Although the appropriate technology is available, the cost of recycling the sludge was so high that no commercial enterprise was prepared to take on the task. We are on the right track, but we need to give the business sector incentives to play its part too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fierce nature of this competition will continue to grow as we witness, on the one hand, population growth, concentrated in particular in the emerging countries and, on the other hand, economic growth at sustained rates, which will occur in these emerging countries and increase the global demand for resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the geographical location of resources in some countries generates and complicates this competition since some countries are inclined to use the resources they own for political ends. This is why it is no coincidence that governments in some countries intervene with industrial policies to support and give an edge to the companies operating in this global competition. We cannot fail to notice that some countries are using public funds to create such advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot stand idly by, and I welcome the course this strategy is taking. Our main efforts must obviously be aimed at decoupling economic growth in European countries from the consumption of resources through innovation and savings. At the same time, we must provide greater support to European companies at EU level by adopting policies which, on the one hand, will encourage strategic alliances, along with private investment in countries rich in resources and, certainly, compliance with fair trade conditions across raw material markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many speakers have pointed out how much businesses are now dependent on mineral raw materials when it comes to jobs. The latest example that has come to the attention of consumers was the announcement by a small lamp producer that the price of energy-saving bulbs would rise because of difficulties with the supply of rare earths. The price rises were enormous. Accordingly, it is high time that we addressed this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mr Bütikofer for coming up with such well-balanced answers. When it comes to the question of achieving results, I believe it is not important that each of us should insist that our opinion is the right one, but rather that everything should be seen in context. That is also why the Commission is correct with its three-pillar approach, which requires us to address the question of tapping new sources of raw materials in Europe too. One of my colleagues has just pointed out that we must also consider technology. Mr Florenz indicated that we would encounter conflicts with other legislation and that we would need to decide where the boundaries lie and how much the various issues mean to us or how we can tap new raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is naturally a huge need to tap into greater potential in relation to recycling than is currently the case. There is no doubt about that. However, this is not something to be pursued ‘at any price’, but needs to be considered in a rational and differentiated way.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the question of international relations is a significant element. Portraying raw materials diplomacy as an instrument of suppression, as one of my colleagues has just done, would indicate a failure to read the text. I believe that international agreements and cooperation are urgently needed so that we in Europe can make greater use of our potential in the distribution of raw materials. Naturally this also means dealing with other countries in an upright fashion. However, I believe that imposing limits on growth or specifications from the Commission on how raw materials are to be used, or more stringent regulations would be the wrong path to choose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful that we have found a wording in relation to the complicated issue of taxation that we can all agree on. I would ask my colleagues to ensure that this wording is retained, so that we can all support it later on. Broad majority support from Parliament is more important than insisting on having things one’s own way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge needs to be turned into an opportunity which will revitalise Europe’s industrial power. A European industrial innovation strategy is needed, aimed at using Europe’s raw materials efficiently. Making the ways that European industries use raw materials more innovative will contribute significantly to Europe’s competitiveness, sustainability and supply security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must develop partnerships with third countries and step up negotiations on raw materials. This can help establish an international regulatory platform which will ensure that the Union is supplied with the necessary raw materials from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must carry out a study which will identify European industries’ import dependency and the threats to the raw materials supply, and also assess current and future prices. The study will enable industries and research institutions to engage in long-term projects and investments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think this debate gets really interesting when we speak about specific raw materials. I would like to endorse Mrs de Lange’s comments on the use of phosphorus: how it is in decline and is finite in supply, and how we need to look again at how we will produce food – not just within the European Union but globally – given the circumstances of that single raw material which is crucial to food production.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are many others. Your report did take on board some of the comments of the Committee on Agriculture, and I thank you for that, but I do think that when it comes to the three-pillar approach it does not mention agriculture and food. It talks specifically about other <span class="italic">acquis</span> and industries, and I think that is a mistake. One of the most crucial areas, in my view, for the world and also for the European Union, is food security. We need raw materials to produce food, and many of those that go into food production, into the land, are scarce and in short supply. We need a strategy to ensure that we can continue to have agriculture within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore necessary to use this opportunity to stress the environmental and economic efficiency of manipulating and exploiting the European raw material base. The entire economic chain should lead towards an efficient use of the raw material base, because no material is here forever. This is why we should emphasise high environmental efficiency such that resources are recycled to be used several times over. I especially want to emphasise the importance of recycling. I therefore support the Commission’s challenge to turn the challenge into an opportunity and to create a long-term European Raw Materials Road Map to 2050. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, these are not just rare materials, but also the source of political conflict. In view of the announcement by China, which supplies 97% of high-tech metals, that it intended reducing extraction, the European Union would be well advised to consider stockpiling these materials as part of its raw materials strategy. Plans to support sustainable raw materials extraction in the EU require a sophisticated strategy. Because of the long lead time of five to 10 years, we need to consider now what raw materials requirements we will need to cover in the long term. These deliberations must also take account of the fact that China has secured raw materials sources for itself in Africa, Mongolia or Afghanistan for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that recycling will slowly become a more economically interesting prospect in view of the mountains of scrap electronic equipment and rising raw materials prices. However, this should not lead us to choose a radical solution that would cause public outrage – similar to the ban on light bulbs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if you had the best football manager in the world, he would not win much without the raw material – that is good footballer players. It is the same thing with industries and so forth. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the rapporteur is to be complimented on a very practical and necessary report, because if Europe is to remain competitive in the world, then it is absolutely vital that we have a constant source of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must look at the raw materials sources within our own boundaries and certainly not inhibit their development by being over-restrictive. Sometimes I think we have been somewhat restrictive in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we obviously want to be environmentally friendly and so forth – everybody agrees with that – but also we can do an awful lot in terms of recycling. Recycling is something that is in many respects in its infancy, and any material that is recycled can of course be used over and over again and this means that less basic raw materials are required.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, something which has been mentioned by a number of people, rare earths are absolutely vital. It is said that China controls 97% of rare earths and, as previous speakers pointed out, they are so essential now for so many appliances we use in everyday life that this situation certainly needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we have not much time to waste. We have to be competitive and remain competitive, and this is a strategy to do so. My compliments to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to know a little bit more about the difference, which you said you welcomed, between the Commission’s proposal and that of the European Parliament. That is all well and good, but hang on a minute: what specific measures are you are going to take?</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about stockpiling and, to be honest, that does not sound like the right solution to me. I hope that you are not going to go down that route and I would be grateful if you could give us a specific answer on that. The focus has been confined to industrial material only and a lot has already been said about phosphate. I completely endorse what has been said, and that is, indeed, an extremely important issue. However, how are you going to ensure that attention is paid to that, as well as to innovation?</p>
<p class="contents">Originally, we had efficiency targets, but now they have been removed altogether. I would, nevertheless, like to see an efficiency target, analogous with the energy targets. We did call for a landfill ban, but that proposal has been watered down in the meantime. However, I would also like to see a target for waste – and that is something that you, too, think is extremely important – so that we remain on top of that waste and are able to process it. We therefore need a landfill ban, so that all that material can be sent straight into the recycling chain.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the news on the quality mark? Last but not least, the fiscal measures that we have already discussed. Who is going to take the initiative on that? Is the EIB going to play a role? Besides, who is going to coordinate all of that? You, or Mr Potočnik, with his resource efficiency flagship? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio Tajani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I repeat the Commission’s position, which I believe is fully in line with the text presented by Mr Bütikofer: when it comes to the issue of raw materials, we are aiming for a balanced strategy that is based on three pillars, namely the strategy within the European Union, the strategy outside the European Union and the strategy to promote innovation; and I shall begin with the last one, which is, I repeat, a balanced position, a balanced strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, in one of the first documents that it presented on innovation, insisted on the innovation partnership, and the second innovation partnership is the one that specifically concerns the issue of raw materials. It has obtained the Council’s backing, and we intend to build on this decision with the involvement of the European Parliament. The innovation partnership will focus on recycling and substitution, so it is neither a stopgap measure nor a fallback option. Rather, the innovation partnership came before the document on raw materials, and so it is incorrect to say that the European Commission thought about other things before the innovation partnership and recycling measures. I regret that many of the Members who tabled questions are absent at the moment, but our decision to promote recycling and substitution measures was actually taken before the document on raw materials was presented.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the strategy within the European Union, perhaps I spoke too quickly in Italian, and Ms Ulvskog was unable to hear what I said about Sweden: I said that Greenland will be one of the places that we visit so that we can carry out work to see what can be done in relation to raw materials; I said that I took part in and co-convened with the Swedish Government a meeting held in the European Parliament and presided over by the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which initiatives concerning raw materials in the Barents Sea were discussed. I have already arranged a visit to Sweden with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs so that I can go and see what can be done in relation to raw materials in the area concerned. I repeat – since the interpretation may not have been accurate when I spoke in Italian, and I therefore wanted to reassure Ms Ulvskog – that I have not forgotten about Sweden. However, Greenland was part of Denmark until fairly recently, and today there is a union with the Kingdom of Greenland. I therefore think that Greenland is not all that far removed from our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to international policy, I wish to reassure you – and I regret that Ms Matias and Ms Figueiredo are not in the Chamber at present – that I have no intention of pursuing neocolonial policies in Africa. I come from a country that was the first to apologise to Africa for the mistakes made and the atrocities committed during the colonial era; I do not think that Europe should have a colonial policy in that continent. Rather, my work in relation to raw materials agreements sees the countries of Africa becoming involved and playing a strong role: all this work has been examined in meetings with the African Union in close cooperation with many countries of the African Union, precisely because Africa must not be regarded as a victim of neocolonialism. Moreover, I do not believe that Europe’s aim today is neocolonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to an issue that was raised by Ms Schnieber-Jastram and Mr Lange when tabling their question, and subsequently highlighted by Ms Ek, I should like to say that the Commission is seriously committed to supporting the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is an emerging international standard designed to ensure transparent revenues and accountability within the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently increased our support for this initiative by contributing to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund and cofinancing an expert group, supporting national projects and participating more in the Council. However, the initiative still has its shortcomings, starting with the fact that, of the more than 50 hydrocarbon- and mineral resource-rich countries that are covered by the Trust Fund, only nine have so far complied with the provisions of the EITI.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the presentation of a formal proposal on a country reporting requirement following the discussion with the EU Member States and Parliament, the Commission is exploring the possibility of introducing a country-by-country financial reporting requirement for publicly traded companies in the EU, and, depending on the outcome of the assessment being carried out, we may be able to table a legislative proposal on the subject in autumn. The proposal will supplement and enhance the EITI and will be implemented in the same spirit as the US Dodd-Frank Act, to which Mr Bütikofer referred. Public consultation on the issue took place from October 2010 to 2011, and the results are currently being assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the last issue, stockpiling, we believe that the responsibility for guaranteeing raw material supplies essentially lies with companies and that the role of political and institutional authorities is to ensure the most suitable working conditions. However, the Commission is willing to discuss, in close cooperation with the Member States, the benefits of a raw materials stockpiling programme, the practical ways in which to implement it and the added value of such a programme, which could, moreover, take inspiration from the existing oil reserve programme. This possibility has begun to be examined in a pilot survey, which is still under way.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not responded to all of the issues raised during the debate but I am due to speak for another half an hour, and I think that it is important to listen to Mr Bütikofer instead. However, I remain at the disposal of all the MEPs to address any individual issues relating to the EU raw materials strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also thank the Vice-President of the Commission Mr Tajani for his comments and, in particular, for his support for the establishment of a competency network for rare earths and the other practical suggestions he has made; thank you Mr Tajani.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has rightly been said about the extraction of raw materials on the domestic front. I believe there is a lot of work to do in this area. However, we must also take a sensitive approach to ecologically sensitive areas. As the report also states, it is important that we should not falsely cast industrial policy and conservation as two opposing movements. That is why I was pleased that the Directorate-General for the Environment and the Directorate-General for Enterprise were able to reach an agreement. Urban mining is important. We could say that our mines also include the old laptops and mobile phones we all have languishing in the back of a cupboard somewhere. The fact is, we have to make recycling an economic solution. My reason for saying this is that last week I attended the opening of the world’s most modern recycling plant for lithium batteries. This is also something that must become an economic solution. Cradle to cradle is a wonderful prospect. We need to make waste an old-fashioned word.</p>
<p class="contents">We need further discussions on stockpiling. I hear different opinions coming from the Commission. I know, for example, that Mr De Gucht takes a very critical view of this issue. I am not yet convinced about how we can manage the stockpiling of rare earths, for example, when China is continuing to reduce production. We can discuss this, however. I would like to state expressly to Ms Girling, who is no longer in the Chamber: we need to proceed with circumspection in all of these questions and impact assessments are required.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another word on external affairs: I do not see raw materials policy as neocolonialism. Otherwise the Commission and Parliament would never have recognised the principle of the sovereignty of raw materials. For me it is important that no time should be lost. We need to cooperate with the US and Japan. However we must also recognise, for example, that Japan is currently investing heavily in research aimed at developing substitution strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one has benefited from this. It is therefore necessary to develop new approaches for dealing with the issue of raw materials (RM) – especially those which are most critical – in an innovative and innovation-promoting manner, with a view to ultimately avoiding zero-sum games. We must develop a coherent and focused strategy with priority actions for RM: an industrial innovation strategy to secure RM and our competitiveness. Any strategy on RM will ultimately have to focus on increasing innovation in how European industries use RM as this will make a significant contribution to our competitiveness, sustainability and the security of supply. The RM challenge must be turned into an opportunity to invigorate Europe’s industrial power by tapping our innovation and R&amp;D potential. Besides an industrial innovation strategy that aims to lower resource consumption and increase recycling in addition to the sustainable domestic potential that the EU holds, the European Union will, naturally, have to continue to rely on external suppliers for its RM. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that in a climate of great economic uncertainty around the world, it is necessary to deliver an industrial policy for European businesses that recognises the vital importance of having access to raw materials. Too often, in fact, Europe falls victim to financial speculation by exporting countries that have a monopoly over resources that are crucial to the aerospace, automotive, chemical and construction industries, for example, and therefore cause their prices to become extremely unstable. Some estimates show that demand in the EU for a number of essential raw materials could actually treble by 2030, thus compounding the current situation. We must therefore act fast, strengthen our trade strategy and propose concrete, achievable measures, such as the reintroduction of extraction activities in the EU and recycling. In this connection, I must stress that waste electrical and electronic equipment often conceals a real treasure trove of metals that ought to be made accessible through recycling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission had included biotic resources in its communication and thus the raw materials strategy contributes to facing the challenges of Europe, and can be anchored into the other EU policies to tackle them. This report, focusing only on minerals, takes a narrow and short-term approach to tackling the availability of specific raw materials and particularly rare earths. It fails to fulfil the task given and some measures are disproportionate. Article 15 calls for a study on the effects of a tax on water and land use, which would hurt our sustainable forest industries. This would make wood-based products more expensive than metals and minerals, and at times when substituting high-carbon products with low-carbon wood products forms a partial answer in the fight against climate change. I hope the Commission, while taking up proposals from the report, keeps its broad approach including biotic resources (e.g. wood), pushes for the Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, with all raw materials addressed, and recognises the positive contribution to meeting the challenges of forests, forestry and forest-based industries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, for example, China controls 97% of global production of rare earth minerals, and since 2005 has been systematically reducing its exports as growing global demand has pushed up prices. China is probably planning to halt the export of certain strategic raw materials as soon as 2015. It is therefore clear that the strategy on effective use of raw materials will determine the competitiveness of European industry. We must aim above all for the reuse and recycling of material currently available. For example, obtaining aluminium through recycling is 95% cheaper than producing it from virgin material. Millions of tonnes of potentially usable material is lying in European landfills. An effective waste policy is not just an environmental symbol, but above all a fundamental prerequisite for securing independence in terms of raw materials. It is now impossible to guarantee that development policy will not become a diplomatic tool for obtaining raw materials from developing countries that have extensive reserves. So-called raw materials diplomacy threatens to lead to a hidden neocolonialism which sees countries with extensive reserves as mere exporters of raw materials. Europe has been caught napping and we must adopt measures as quickly as possible to ensure sufficient strategic raw materials for information technology and renewable energy facilities and other key sectors.
