<p class="contents">Question No 41 by <span class="bold">José Valverde López </span>(H−0139/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Food analysis unit of the Environment Institute (Ispra)</p>
<p class="contents">The European Environment Institute in Ispra has a food analysis unit which monitors the quality of food ingredients, additives and chemical products generally used in the preparation of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">What links does this unit have with the various Commission services responsible for food security? Are there any plans to incorporate this unit into the planned European Food Security Agency?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Valverde's question.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, I am happy to answer this question which concerns an important subject, namely the Environment Institute and the problem of food safety. Since 1 October 1998, the Food Products Unit has been part of the new Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the Joint Research Centre. This unit provides the independent scientific expertise needed for preparing and implementing various EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the fifth framework programme for research is implemented, the unit will continue to provide scientific and technical support to various directorates‐general of the Commission, for example to DG III for industry, to DG VI for agriculture, to DG XI for the environment, to DG XXI for customs and to DG XXIV for consumer health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The main research priorities of the unit within the fifth framework programme for research are to control the safety and quality of food and related items and to detect genetically modified organisms in food and also in the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The unit"s activities will essentially involve developing, validating and harmonising analytical methods. To a certain extent this involves determining uniform European analytical methods which we can therefore regard as reference methods. The unit"s activities will also involve developing databases and disseminating the results of research. The areas covered by the unit include food and animal feed, cosmetics, food packaging and childcare products and toys.</p>
<p class="contents">I can give you some more specific examples of the work to be carried out by this Institute. In particular it will validate two methods, one involving general screening and the other which will be more specific, for the detection of genetically modified organisms in staple foods, for example soya bean or maize flour. This study will be extended to processed products. I can also cite the development of methods for determining the presence of vegetable oils and fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate. This study will serve as a scientific basis for the new ‘chocolate" directive which is being prepared. The Institute will also participate in studies on the migration of phthalates in toys. This work involves developing and coordinating the validation of a mechanical method to simulate the sucking of toys and childcare products. You will be aware that there was recently a major debate on this subject because phthalates can be the cause of serious illnesses in children who suck or chew toys.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is the validation of methods in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the safety of animal feed, one demonstrating the appropriate heat treatment of animal meals according to the legislation and the other allowing the detection of animal meals in animal feed. Finally, I can mention a database for wine, covering over 10 000 wines, and the fight against fraud in the area of wine, alcohol and spirits. These are just a few specific examples of the Institute"s activity.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the reference to the European Agency for Food Safety, the Commission would point out that it has not so far put forward any proposals on this. It therefore seems premature today to discuss the possible participation of joint research centres. However, this is clearly something which can be studied at a later date.</p>

Her detailed account of the major restructuring which has taken place at Ispra and, in particular, of the new activities undertaken by the Institute for Health will also be of great interest to the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to emphasise if I may, Commissioner, is that the Commission must continue working on the project to establish the new food analysis unit which will be able to coordinate all these activities and render the combined effort more efficient. I am reiterating a hope rather than putting a question, and I hope that the Commission will be as efficient as it has been in restructuring the Ispra centre and will be able to complete its work with the creation of this unit.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 42 by <span class="bold">Christine Oddy </span>(H−0211/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Financial control problems in Nicaragua</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Nicaragua from 17‐21 February and was alarmed to find, when I went to the Commission office in Waspam Rio Coco that no work appeared to be carried out and the people at the office were watching television; a caretaker showed us round and said the project manager had gone to Managua in December and had not returned. The skeleton staff had not been paid for several months, there were no files in the filing cabinet, the Land Rover outside had lost its spare tyre and was not properly locked and another Commission car was lying wrecked in another part of the village. I have severe misgivings about the appropriateness of such a lavish Commission office in such a small remote village. Will the Commission investigate urgently?</p>
<p class="contents">I offer you a warm welcome, Mr Marín. Mr Marín and I go back a long time. Not only are we friends but we also fought side by side in the cause of civil liberties in Spain during a difficult period. So I am particularly pleased to be able to give him the floor. Mr Marín, you may reply to Mrs Oddy"s question.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Thank you for your kind introduction, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oddy has asked me about the situation concerning what appears to be a European Commission office in the Río Coco area of Nicaragua. I must first of all make it quite clear that the only European Commission delegation in Nicaragua is located in Managua.</p>
<p class="contents">The premises you visited do not belong to the European Commission and the staff you met are not employed by the European Commission. That project was completed in 1997. Therefore, none of the individuals on the premises have any professional association with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the office equipment and the two Land Rovers which you said were not being put to good use in 1997, you will doubtless be aware that whenever a project is concluded, any remaining vehicles and office equipment which are sufficiently depreciated are handed over to the local authorities. In this case, the vehicles and office equipment were handed over to the Nicaraguan governor of the Río Coco province. Clearly, there has been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have instructed the Commission"s delegate in Managua to visit the Waspam region and ascertain <span class="italic">in situ</span> why the Nicaraguan authorities did not, as it appears, put the two Land Rovers and the office equipment donated to them to good use.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Thank you for the answer. I am aware that the project was closed down but nevertheless the building is operating to all intents and purposes as a Commission building. It has a sign to that effect outside and the two vehicles I referred to have Commission logos on them. To the outside world it appears to be a Commission office and people in the village refer to it as a Commission office. I do not accept the answer I was given and the people who I spoke to thought that they were still employed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only reiterate what I have asked in the original question. This situation needs to be investigated urgently. If there is a misunderstanding then the people should be put right who think that they are in arrears of salary.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mrs Oddy, the necessary checks have already been carried out, and I can confirm that the building in question does not belong to the Commission. I am unaware of the reasons behind this situation you describe though I can make an educated guess at them. The delegate has indeed confirmed that the European Union"s logo is painted on the wall of the building. The European Union"s logo is also painted on the two Land Rovers.</p>
<p class="contents">As I explained, when a project is completed any sufficiently depreciated vehicles are handed over to the local authorities, and in this case they were given to the local governor. I will tell our delegate to get rid of the logos on the Land Rovers. But I must stress that the building does not belong to the European Commission. It used to, but we stopped using it two years ago. A misunderstanding has arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from all this and following the devastation caused by hurricane Mitch, the Commission decided to repeat the process, as you will doubtless be aware. On this occasion, of course, it was handled in a different way, and not through the local governor of the Río Coco province. A competition was held and was won by an Italian NGO. We decided on such a procedure because this small example illustrates once again how difficult it is to deal with what we always term sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union financed this project aimed at the Misquito Indians for five years. According to the arrangements for sustainable development, once a certain period of time has elapsed, responsibility must be transferred to the local authorities. We did so two years ago in 1997. You have seen for yourself how sustainable development often requires constant European presence, because when European cooperation is withdrawn, the kind of situation you witnessed can arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that the delegate has been instructed to ask the governor of the Río Coco region for an explanation, and I shall also ask for the logos to be removed from the office and from the Land Rovers in order to prevent any confusion amongst the local population.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Aviation safety</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that aviation safety standards are high and, in order to enhance those standards, there are plans for a European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA). The Commission is working on these plans at the request of the Council. Originally, a proposal was promised for the beginning of last year. The date has been gradually postponed ever since. The latest information, however, is that a draft convention will be available by the end of February.</p>
<p class="contents">Is a draft convention now available? When will it be possible for the convention to enter into force?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to welcome Mr Kinnock to the House. I am sure he will show due consideration to the interpreters and to the work of the Chair today, and I invite him to reply to the question by Mr Lindqvist. Mr Kinnock, you have the floor.</p>

In reply I would say that following the Council decision of 16 July 1998, the Commission was authorised to open negotiations with the states whose civil aviation regulatory authorities are full members of the joint aviation authorities but not members of the European Community, with a view to concluding an agreement establishing a European civil aviation safety authority that takes the legal form of an international organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations will be carried out in accordance with the negotiating directives and in accordance with the ad hoc procedures specified by the Council in order to ensure close coordination between the Community and its Member States. The authorisation to open negotiations entailed the establishment of a special committee to which the Commission is obliged to submit a draft text of the founding treaty before commencing negotiations. The Commission has prepared a first draft text which has recently been submitted to the members of the special committee.</p>
<p class="contents">When a text has been finalised it will serve as a basis for the negotiations with the European countries outside the Community. It is envisaged that such negotiations can be finalised within the course of this year The European Parliament will naturally be kept fully informed of the process. The convention will then have to be ratified by the contracting parties and signatories in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Community this will be done in conformity with Article 228 of the Treaty, that is after consultation of this Parliament by the Council. In order to avoid delay in implementation it is envisaged that the potential contacting parties should agree to implement the convention on a provisional basis as early as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 44 by <span class="bold">Bernie Malone </span>(H−0209/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Dumping of canned fruit on South African market</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the profoundly detrimental impact that certain aspects of the present Common Agricultural Policy are having on many third‐world farmers? I refer particularly to subsidies for EU fruit producers and the dumping of European fruit on the South African market.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that this situation is undoing much of the good work being done by Community development policy, and if so, what does the Commission intend to do to rectify this?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mr Pinheiro and ask him to reply to Mrs Malone's question.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinheiro, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question put to me by Bernie Malone could also apply to other products in the past, especially beef, during the upheaval on the South African market. European exports rose during that period but the situation has now been rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the issue of canned fruit and vegetables on the South African market, I can tell you that European exports are extremely small. The only product of any significance is canned tomatoes, but even they account for no more than 7 % of the market. They are therefore unlikely to lead to any sort of crisis or cause major concern. As far as the fruit and vegetable market in South Africa is concerned, the country suffered serious problems in the wake of the World Trade Organisation agreements, especially since South Africa applied a highly irrational customs system, often imposing customs duties instead of quotas. In some cases, the reduction in customs duties was excessive. The situation was such that, when we started negotiating the cooperation and trade agreement with South Africa, we had to accept – and did – that the principles of ‘stand still" and ‘roll back" – traditionally sacrosanct principles in negotiations and free trade agreements – could be subject to a number of exemptions in the case of South Africa, so as to take account of the unusually large reduction in customs duties on certain South African products and, specifically, on goods such as canned fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations that took place forced us to look in detail at our bilateral trade in canned fruits and vegetables and all other products and enabled us to reach a satisfactory solution: South African exports to Europe will continue to take account of our ability to absorb them, the country's export capacity and the Community's own supplies. These were by no means easy negotiations but I can tell you that the final outcome is well‐balanced. It is true that some Mediterranean countries maintain that we were too generous with the South Africans. For my part, I feel that the negotiations were balanced and that they open the way for achieving a sustainable market.</p>

This is an area of European policy that a lot of citizens are very worried about. You are aware of the campaign that is being run in relation to canned tomatoes in particular. It is not just a few people campaigning but it is a massive campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the letters I receive in Dublin are from members of religious orders, for example. They have a very healthy respect for the European Union but they disagree fundamentally with the way the common agricultural policy operates with regard to all the areas mentioned in relation to food and also in relation to fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">You know yourself that the agreement with South Africa was held up because of the fisheries question, too. Europeans are going down there and trawling for whatever they can get, damaging the indigenous fishing industry.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinheiro, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – As regards canned tomatoes, the largest exports that we had account for roughly 7 % of the South African market. As regards other African countries, our exports are of roughly 90 000 tonnes for the whole ACP area. So, I do not think frankly they are disrupting the internal market in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fisheries, nowadays there is no access for European boats to South African waters. We have asked South Africa to put us on an equal footing with other countries which have access to South African waters. It is not asking too much to be considered on an equal footing especially when we are prepared to open up our markets to South African fisheries products in a way which suits South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite easy to blame big Europe for some of the difficulties that exist from time to time in South Africa. But let me reassure you that in the Development Council, and in the Commission as well, we have been looking very carefully at all the potential inconsistencies between CAP policies and development policies. The problem with beef arose a few years ago and I am quite confident that has been solved and that there is no such problem today. But if one should occur, we are always prepared to deal with it. Our policy is to have coherence between the CAP and development policy. So we are always open to listen to complaints and study them, in any situation whatsoever.</p>

It may only be 7 % spread over a year but the information I have received and which I will pass on to you is that a flood of cheap tomatoes, particularly last year, contributed to the loss of some 10 000 jobs in the canning industry, in areas with extremely high unemployment in South Africa. Certainly the trade unions and others have been blaming the European Union for that. I think that matter does need looking at again.</p>
<p class="contents">On a related matter: as you know, when the trade agreement with South Africa was rejected by the General Affairs Council, France raised the general issue of export refunds as one of its reasons for refusing the deal. Can you tell us how confident you are that the meeting of 22 March will endorse the trade agreement?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinheiro, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – Sometimes subsidies are paid to canned‐tomato producers because the price at which they have to purchase tomatoes is higher than the international average price. So it is to compensate them for the higher prices which the CAP imposes on tomatoes, to ensure a level playing field as regards canned tomatoes. Sometimes we are accused of dumping because of those subsidies to the producers of canned tomatoes. I do not think it is appropriate to use that word.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall amount was 6 500 tonnes of canned tomatoes. That is the figure of our exports to South Africa which accounts for 7 % of their consumption. No doubt, after these two interventions, we will look at it again, together with DG VI.</p>
<p class="contents">As to trade agreement and refunds, it was indeed suggested at a certain moment in the negotiations that if South Africa would lower some tariffs we would phase out our export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union, the difficulty for France is not with the specificity of a given product but the fact that these may rise or may open up the door for phasing out export subsidies altogether, which France is not prepared to do at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise of lowering tariffs, phasing out export subsidies: at the end the one who pays is the South African consumer. So for South Africa it was not such a big deal. That is why when France raised some difficulties, I immediately said that I had no doubt whatsoever that I could take it out of the agreement without any difficulty at all, because in the end it would be South Africa which would have to pay for this kind of deal. That was why I said I would take it out immediately because South Africa, of course, was ready to accept that.</p>

<p class="contents">I have to say, however, that in my opinion the European Union was exemplary in the way in which it took account of certain legitimate South African concerns – in particular the fact that it had inherited a difficult situation in terms of how customs duties were applied, and the need to restructure the automobile and textile sectors (something now under way), to mention just two examples. Similarly, we met with some understanding on the South African side over some of the problems that we face within the European Union, reflected in some specific points of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I still believe that this agreement is a good one and have high hopes that on 22 March, perhaps with some fine tuning, the Member States will see the final outcome as positive for the European Union and acceptable for each of the Member States. But, as for the principle, I fully agree with Mrs Schierhuber.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Fishing in Gibraltar</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission studied the situation in Gibraltar, in the wake of last week's events (the seizure of the Spanish fishing boat ‘Piraña' by the Gibraltarian authorities), and is it planning to take any measures to ensure that Community legislation is respected?</p>

It concerns the limits of territorial waters, a matter which is not within the Community"s competence.</p>
<p class="contents">As it has said many times in the past and reiterated only recently, the Commission is not therefore empowered to intervene directly in this situation. All the Commission can do is encourage both parties to resolve the problem and maintain contact with the governments involved. The Commission does however regret that because of its legal basis, this issue does not fall within the Community"s competence.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these events took place in an area where Community law does apply. The area in question is covered by the Treaty. Indeed, serious doubts have also been cast on the effective application of a whole range of Community directives in this area relating not only to fisheries but also to other issues such as taxation, finance, money laundering and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">This apart, I should like to make a final political comment. I agree with your remarks on good relations and the need to create a climate in which this and other disputes can be handled in a reasonable way, avoiding unnecessary tension in the area. Such tension has a negative impact on both the Spanish and the Gibraltarian populations, though the Spanish population are uppermost in my mind at present. The appropriate climate in which to deal with this dispute in a reasonable way will not be created by making life difficult for the local Spanish population.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed at the moment is a series of measures designed to reduce the tension which has built up in the area. Only then will it be possible to resolve this dispute and any others which might arise in the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN) The Commission seeks to ensure the correct implementation of Community directives in Gibraltar as it does in all areas of the Community, taking account of the particular regime that applies to Gibraltar as defined in particular in the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom. Where appropriate the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against the UK for failure to implement applicable directives. In the area of company law, for example, the Commission has sent four reasoned opinions to the UK for failure to implement company law directives in the territory of Gibraltar, etc. etc.</span></p>

<p class="contents">This is a very important point which was brought up by Mr Pérez Royo, particularly the matter of is it planning to take any measures to ensure the Community legislation is respected? In terms of actually reducing tension in that area, the most important thing is to start to implement freedom of movement between Gibraltar and Spain. If we actually started that and sorted it out locally, as the fishing dispute has been pretty well sorted out locally between those two communities, tensions would disappear very quickly. So could the Commissioner suggest ways in which Mr Pérez Royo could help towards that freedom of movement as required by the Treaties, and reduce those tensions?</p>

There is no reference to territorial waters surrounding the Rock in the Treaty of Utrecht, which justifies and legitimises certain British activities in Gibraltar. You will be aware, Commissioner, that according to the Treaty of Utrecht, the town and fortress of Gibraltar were ceded to the United Kingdom. However, that Treaty does not cover the area later occupied by the British and which does not have territorial waters. The extent of Spanish and British territorial waters has never been specified, because although Spain recognises the Treaty of Utrecht, it disputes the United Kingdom"s claims in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Spain"s claims were not affected in any way by its accession to the Community. On 12 June 1985, Spain signed the Accession Treaty along with the United Kingdom. On 15 June, letters were exchanged with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, making it quite clear that Spain"s accession to the Community did not affect its claim to Gibraltar.</p>

The European Council has therefore requested the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission to draw up a new action plan for the period 2000 to 2004. In the Commission, the work is progressing well. Most of our services are directly involved and are now working flat out to produce their contribution. I and my officials are responsible partly for the internal coordination of the work and partly for the sectors that have a bearing on the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It takes several decades to develop a European drugs policy. Consequently, my premiss is that the EU's actions must have a sound body of knowledge and well‐evaluated experience on which to build. In the long term, therefore, continuity and consistency will be the main themes in our forthcoming proposal. As a result, our contribution will build on the previous plan, but it will include an evaluation of what has been accomplished during the last five‐year period. And last but not least, we are describing new trends and tendencies that require special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is to be in a position to present the new action plan by the end of the spring – in May. Our proposal will then as usual be forwarded directly to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for further consideration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Illegal immigration to the European Union from northern Morocco is, in many cases, a straightforward matter of the smuggling of human beings. It is not only a pressing problem for the Member States in the Mediterranean region, but also concerns, to a large extent, the entire European Union. The individuals who allow themselves to be persuaded by the people‐smugglers are, more often than not, the poorest and most vulnerable migrants, some of whom are desperately seeking better living conditions and are prepared to take enormous risks to achieve their goal. Others fall victim to the modern slave trade in women that goes on all over Europe. Each year, a growing number of young women are lured by false promises of well‐paid work into prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation. Many lives are wasted every year because of the depredations of the people‐smugglers. We know for certain that those who try to reach the coast of Europe by sea from Morocco often meet a grim fate. The battle against the trade in people must remain a priority in the Union. During the past year, a great deal has also been done to step up cooperation in precisely this area within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, the EDU's mandate was extended to include the smuggling of human beings. With the establishment of Europol, the Union's capacity in this area will be further enhanced. In November of the same year, the Council of Ministers also set up the STOP programme, the aim of which was to strengthen the Member States' ability to combat the trade in human beings. It has enabled us to support and encourage an exchange of experiences and to pursue activities to raise the level of competence throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the American Government, we have also carried out preventive work in the countries where the trade in women originates. Among other initiatives, campaigns have been mounted with the aim of trying to make young girls aware of the risks involved in trying to reach Europe with the help of people‐smugglers.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures are only regarded as a first step along the right road. Obviously, major economic interests are at stake and fundamental values are being put to the test. In future, the Commission will continue to avail itself of every opportunity to put a stop to the smuggling of human beings. It is also gratifying that the new Treaty makes it easier for us to really get to grips with this problem in the future.</p>

Her reply was very specific as far as the analysis of the problem was concerned, but quite inadequate when it came to the Commission"s competence, that is to say, the measures it plans to take. The feeling here is that her answer has not provided us with any information at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As you stated yourself, Commissioner, the problem is very serious indeed but certain measures could easily be taken. For instance, in the summer it would perhaps be possible to set up surveillance operations to detect the flimsy craft used to make the crossing. Such arrangements already exist to detect fishing operations and fish, yet we seem unable to do the same in order to detect people. In addition, television campaigns designed to dissuade would‐be immigrants from making the crossing could be broadcast on television in northern Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is doing nothing at all to cope with the very serious problems which exist on the southern borders of the European Union. For you to reply to a question like this by merely setting out all the possible measures amounts to an abdication of responsibility. It amounts to saying nothing at all, Commissioner.</p>

There are good prospects for Europol, but at the same time, if it is to achieve practical results in its surveillance operations, as the honourable Member would like it to do, this has to be done through cooperation with and between the Member States. We know that there are boats plying between Morocco and Spain and Gibraltar, and that the different authorities concerned are cooperating fully. I have been to the places in question myself to see what is being done, both as regards control of the trade in human beings and the presence of drugs on these boats.</p>

Furthermore, the Council of Ministers has only recently set up a high‐level group specifically to study the countries from which large numbers of people are trying to reach our nations.

<p class="contents">Subject: Follow‐up to the complaint concerning unfair trade measures which has been lodged with the TWO</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of 1997, in response to trade restrictions imposed on exports of skins and hides produced in India, the Commission initiated a WTO dispute settlement procedure in order to protect the interests of the European leather sector which had been suffering from the harmful effects of those restrictions for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">From the initial consultations held in Geneva at the beginning of 1998 there emerged clear confirmation of the fact that the complaint lodged by the Commission was justified. Since that first meeting under the procedure laid down by the TWO, it appears that the negotiations have ground to a halt.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 51 by <span class="bold">Paul Rübig </span>(H−0113/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Differences in punitive duties and voting behaviour in the Council</p>
<p class="contents">There are many aspects to the trans‐Atlantic discussions on banana imports into the EU. One fundamental issue relates to the selective imposition of punitive US duties on imports from thirteen Member States. The equivalent of the sum that has been announced amounts to unilaterally estimated losses of EURO 508 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The banana market organisation applies equally to all fifteen Member States. Within the WTO, too, the EU speaks with one voice. However, punitive duties which affect the EU Member States in different ways distort comparative costs and competition in the Internal Market.</p>

There are two reasons why third countries exclude some Member States from retaliatory measures against the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Member States are still, separately from the Community, individual members of the WTO. Secondly, the origin rules applicable to imports to third countries from the Community are still based on individual Member States. Although Community legislation provides for the notion of Community origin, which is mandatory in certain situations, US and other third countries continue to make a distinction between Member States in this field.</p>

The Commission continues to work towards full implementation of these agreements. The onus is on the United States but we on our side are ready to implement the agreements once the United States grants a waiver under Title IV of the Helms‐Burton Act as foreseen in the London Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset we have expressed determined opposition to both acts. As part of the defence of the European Union against the extra‐territorial effects of these acts the Council passed the blocking statute in November 1996. Its object is to counter the extra‐territorial effects of legislation on a third country, such as the Helms‐Burton Act and ILSA on the territory of the Community. Detailed statistics on EU trade with Cuba are not available. We have consistently taken the view that such trade is legitimate. The Helms‐Burton Act has had a chilling effect in the past and may have distorted the channels in which trade has flowed. That is why the May 1998 agreement was an important step forward.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> In June 1997 an agreement was reached with Norway as part of the definitive anti‐dumping and countervailing measures. These consist mainly of individual price undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters. The Commission devotes considerable resources to monitoring those undertakings and 84 exporters have now had duties imposed upon them because they breached or withdrew from their undertakings. In addition, the market is being constantly monitored, the time given for the reports on the undertakings has been shortened, and when the monitoring showed that the minimum price for salmon fillets was too low, it was increased to include an amount for processing costs. Having found that a number of parties with undertakings were not exporters, those parties were made to withdraw their undertakings, and after it appeared that the proceeds of the Norwegian export tax, which is part of the countervailing measures, were not used in accordance with the agreement, a further agreement between the European Union and Norwegian industries was entered into in October 1998 to deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, the Commission and the Norwegian authorities have agreed on further joint action specifically to root out the possibilities of circumvention. Norway introduced in December 1998 a regulation making it illegal for there to be any salmon sales to the Community via intermediary exporters not bound by the undertakings. The Commission mirrored this restriction and the text of the undertakings also included a stricter minimum price provision where importers related to exporters in Norway source salmon from other intermediary importers in the Community.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 54 by <span class="bold">Richard Howitt </span>(H−0217/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Burma Selective Purchase Law</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, the State of Massachusetts in the USA introduced the Burma Selective Purchase Law banning government procurement from companies that do business in Myanmar. The EC expressed its opposition to the Federal authorities and also filed a complaint before the WTO. Aware that this complaint has temporarily been suspended awaiting the results of a legal investigation into the validity of its ruling, the fact that the Commission submitted a complaint before the WTO is not only contradictory to its own policies imposing sanctions against Myanmar and expressing concern for human rights violations, but it can also be considered a cynical act of impeding an attempt to set a precedent in making international trade policies more coherent with international human rights standards. Can the Commission explain why it applies such contradictory policies and has pursued this policy, thus expressing a contempt for human rights in Myanmar? Under what circumstances can it withdraw its complaint?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Our position on Burma is clear: we deplore the situation facing the people there and support Member States in their determination to maintain pressure on the leadership. This has led to the adoption of a common position on Burma and the withdrawal of GSP benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October the Council adopted an extension to the common position and strengthened it through the widening of a visa ban and by suspending high‐level government visits to Burma. We have also sought to coordinate policies on Burma internationally in order to make the actions of all concerned more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">While our objectives as far as Burma is concerned are similar to those of the United States, that does not mean that we can condone the flagrant breach of international obligations arising from the Massachusetts law. We took the decision to request the panel to rule on the compatibility of the law with the relevant WTO rules, in particular the plurilateral government procurement agreement in July 1998, after having failed in two years to resolve the matter in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Foreign Trade Council of the United States also challenged the Massachusetts law and the US District Court last November declared the law unconstitutional and suspended its application, so, naturally, we suspended our proceedings in the WTO but the American court ruling is under appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our decision to complain to the WTO is not an endorsement of the regime; it is about ensuring predictability in the international trading environment and adhering to internationally binding trade rules. There is no contradiction between the steps we have taken against the Burma regime and our expectation that the United States observes its international commitments.</p>

The contradiction was contained in what you said. For us to deplore human rights abuses in Burma and say that we wish to coordinate actions internationally to make the Burmese regime change its policies and then to eschew the opportunity of using trading opportunities through the WTO in order to coordinate those actions is contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that we have a set of rules under the World Trade Organization but it has repeatedly been the position of this House, both in September last year when the actions of the Commission were condemned, and in my own report on codes of conduct of multinational companies, to say that we must use trading relations through the WTO to uphold trading which is ethical, and respects the environment and human rights. Can he answer the last part of my question which is under what circumstances, should the appeal go the other way in the United States, would the Commission withdraw and ensure that the panel is not revived?</p>

<p class="contents">In reply to my Oral Question H−0761/98<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> , the Commission informed me that the Greek authorities had notified it, on 2 July 1998, of the provisions that they had adopted to incorporate Directive 80/723/EEC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> , as amended, into Greek law. However, owing to a disagreement over the obligations deriving from that Directive, the Commission had decided to wait for the supplementary information it had requested from the Greek authorities before expressing its opinion on the possible discontinuation of infringement proceedings.</p>

According to these provisions, Member States must in particular send the Commission a list of their public undertakings in the manufacturing sector by 31 March of each year at the latest. Non‐compliance with this obligation constitutes an infringement of the law to which the Commission must respond through an appropriate procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, on 3 March, Greece finally supplied the information requested and it seems satisfactory with regard to the undertakings in question. In so doing, Greece has therefore abandoned its alternative view of its obligations under the directive in question. Consequently, the Commission will in all likelihood discontinue the infringement proceedings, subject to a detailed analysis of the information provided. I can therefore give you good news as I believe that Greece is on the way to complying with Community law.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Merger</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently considering the notification of plans for a merger between Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission ensure that a merger will not mean that Danish Crown/Vestjyske Slagterier acquires influence over and an insight into a smaller, competing business such as Defco Food, in which Danish Crown currently has a minority shareholding?</p>
<p class="contents">Defco is a limited company which manufactures and sells products to FDB and Dansk Supermarked in direct competition with Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier. Obviously, it is of the utmost importance for a company such as Defco that the merger does not mean that Danish Crown/Vestjyske Slagterier will acquire an insight into and influence over Defco Food.</p>

<p class="contents">The specific question relates to Defco Food company, which is a Danish producer of processed meat products, and the relationship with Danish Crown, the largest Danish cooperative slaughterhouse, which has a minority shareholding in the company concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as I said, decided today to authorise the operation. But as far as this specific question is concerned we did not find a real problem. In this case we are talking about the market for processed meat products. Processed meat producers, including Defco Food, buy the pork and beef meat they require for their production from within the whole of the EC and not only in the country concerned. So the impact of the merger in this market has to be seen in a wider perspective than the situation in Denmark, while the other problems were mainly related to the situation inside Denmark. Therefore, although we identified several problems, we did not find a problem here so we could not insist under the rules on specific remedies in relation to the question you raise.</p>

The background to my question was a criticism of the merger. I fully understand it – in fact I think it is a sensible thing. I am a little tired of the fact that people have not been willing to look more closely at the problem which arises, for example, from the fact that the company concerned is dependent on Danish Crown. This means, amongst other things, that the company cannot give its employees the opportunity to buy shares because the new, very large merged company will be entitled to step in and acquire shares ahead of the employees. But I do understand that it is a difficult problem for the Commission to solve, so I would like to thank you for your reply.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 57 by <span class="bold">Juan Izquierdo Collado, which has been taken over by Mrs Frutos Gama </span>(H−0161/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Transparency and control of State aid in the field of competition policy</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of competition policy, the criterion of transparency was introduced to facilitate control over areas such as State aid to the European coal industry (Decision No 3632/93/ECSC)<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> , requiring Member States to transfer subsidies previously included in electricity charges to their national budgets. Does the Commission not see the need to pursue the same legal course in the case of the costs of transition in the electricity sector? From the point of view of competition policy legislation, what grounds could be cited to justify treating the two types of aid differently? How, for instance, are consumers supposed to understand why the costs of European coal are no longer deducted from their electricity bills, whilst on the other hand they must bear the costs of the transition to competition resulting from non‐profit‐making investment arising out of public service obligations?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 58 by <span class="bold">Ludivina García Arias </span>(H−0162/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Consumer protection in the field of competition policy</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has announced that the costs of the transition to competition which may be authorised in the liberalised sectors should relate to real investment arising out of the former universal service obligations. Does the Commission not take the view that, where competition policy is concerned, it would be unfair and contrary to the principles of the Treaties for the said costs in the electricity sector specifically and, potentially, in the telecommunications sector, to be charged to domestic consumers and SMEs, and that this State aid should thus be included within national budgets in order to facilitate transparency and control?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> This is an issue which clearly concerns this House because I have answered questions on this before. As you know, we have stressed to the Spanish Government that it must notify this case because it involves what are called stranded costs.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also know that this problem is not unique to Spain as it has arisen in several other Member States due to the electricity directive. We have stressed that, when a system of stranded costs is specified, this may in principle involve a public aid operation and therefore the Commission must at least be able to check whether this aid is in accordance with the stranded costs. As the problem is currently arising in different ways in several Member States, we are trying to develop a coherent method.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Spanish case, we have received the notification and are currently analysing this. Contact will no doubt be made with the Spanish authorities in the coming weeks in order to discuss the Commission"s analysis. As for the consumer, given that this involves public aid, we must judge this case according to the rules in question, namely to see whether the ‘aid" specified is actually compensation for the stranded costs. Consequently, consumer concerns are not a priority in these ‘state aid" matters. These are the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we must not ignore this issue. However, I must remind you that the rule requires the Commission to check whether, in such an operation, the specified aid exceeds what is justifiable. By doing this, I personally believe that we are also acting in the interests of consumers.</p>

This matter is certainly causing concern amongst Members, but it is particularly worrying for domestic consumers and small and medium‐sized enterprises who seem destined to bear the cost of the transition to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I had therefore been hoping for a common sense reply, Commissioner, not a technical one.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the obscurantism of the Spanish Government and its Minister for Industry, I feel you should take it upon yourself, Commissioner, to inform domestic consumers and small and medium‐sized businesses in some of the least favoured regions of the Union – the one I represent, for instance – that this will not be the case. It really is curious to find that the Spanish Minister for Industry is proposing to ‘sell" the reduction in compensation to the sector – in the event that the European Commission does eventually decide on a reduction – as a favour to domestic consumers. According to him, the consumers would be the major beneficiaries of the ensuing reduction in charges.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Commissioner, I would be most grateful if you could explain in plain language to the ordinary Spanish consumer how the costs of the transition to competition will be met: through the electricity bills or from the national budget.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> In the first instance, if we try to limit any state aid, be it in this case or another case, to the strict minimum, at the end of the day it is to the benefit of the consumers because they are usually also taxpayers. Also, we are going to continue to pursue this case, as I explained earlier, the reason being that we felt that this case had to be notified to allow the Commission to do its job.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the declared aim of the policy, namely to liberalise the electricity sector, is entirely shared by the Commission. We feel that more flexibility, more real competition means that we have to see to it that in the energy sector companies do not have too much control of the market; that there is real competition, not only for companies, but also for the individual consumers. As you know, this is not yet the case with the directive. The directive is more modest. But we certainly share the view, which is apparently held by the Spanish Government, that one should liberalise beyond what has been agreed in the directive. That is being encouraged and acknowledged in a positive way by the Commission. But that should not distract us from our other task, to scrutinise whether the costs are strictly proportionate to the money which is under consideration.</p>

The rates they are charged will not be reduced as they should have been, even without taking liberalisation into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a more technical question to put to you, however. Rule 3 of the Council"s Rules of Procedure on the subject of aid states that aid will only be allocated following a Commission decision to authorise it. I do not know if the Commission is aware that the 4.5 % in question is already being deducted from the charges. Aid is therefore already being received. Do you intend to stand firm, Commissioner, and call the Spanish Minister for Industry to account tomorrow, insisting that such charges and the amounts already illegally charged to consumers be frozen, and insisting, too, that all these monies be returned until you authorise the aid?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> There has clearly been a misunderstanding. The authorities should have notified their intentions under the directive and the majority have done this. However, it was not properly understood that this type of operation should also have been notified under Articles 92 and 93. We have had to stress this before certain governments would accept it and this has taken time.</p>
<p class="contents">This has now been achieved. In short, there are two scrutinies: firstly the scrutiny under the directive, for which Mr Papoutsis is responsible, and secondly the scrutiny of a problem or case concerning a state aid. In the case in question, we recorded this as unnotified aid given that the measure had actually already been implemented. However, I must acknowledge that, given the rather confused and unclear situation and perhaps without any intention to mislead, certain governments thought that it was sufficient to notify the case under the directive. We are therefore in an embarrassing position with a government which, I believe in good faith, thought that it had done its work whereas we have had to remind it that it had additional work.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation. As for the others, you will recall that in this very House I warned the authorities concerned that, as the case was being scrutinised, it was perhaps ill‐advised to continue the measure in question, given that the result of the Commission"s scrutiny must normally be awaited.</p>

<p class="contents">The fact is that the Spanish Government and the electricity companies have not heeded this advice and have already implemented the mechanism. This has given rise to the problem of how to reimburse customers if it turns out that they have been overcharged.</p>
<p class="contents">How could millions of customers be reimbursed if the charge had already been included in their electricity bills? Do you not think that in terms of monitoring state aid, which is what this really is, it would be more transparent and more workable if payments were made in stages, annually, through the state budget? Monitoring would also be easier and any wrongs could easily be righted should the need arise. Such an arrangement is already in place for aid to the coal sector. Do you not think that this would be a more sensible method than introducing a 4.5 % surcharge to electricity bills, as well as floating such aid on the financial markets?</p>

This is because, as I have already said, the situation remains uncertain until the Commission has completed its work, in this case drawn its conclusions from the scrutiny. However, the authorities are responsible for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the amounts, for the moment no one can say what these may be. I would repeat that it is only after scrutinising the stranded costs to check that these exist that we can conclude what amount is correct and justifiable in relation to these stranded costs. It is only then that we can say that a particular sum is acceptable for this stranded costs operation and that a sum beyond that is not acceptable. However, I will only be able to tell you this when our scrutiny is completed.</p>
