<p class="contents">Italians are familiar with the difficulties of dealing with organised crime. We are familiar with the way in which organised crime uses activities such as cigarette smuggling, which do not always seem, and I stress that this is only an illusion, to be very serious, in order to sabotage any possible opposition. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a major duty to promote the development of these new areas, many of which look set to join the Community, but there is every likelihood that all our investments will be in vain should we not succeed in defeating these organisations of gangsters which will otherwise reap all the benefit of our investments. The means and resources donated by the European Community would not be used for healthy growth, but would serve to further strengthen the canker of underground organisations. For this reason, I would draw attention to an extremely positive point of the resolution which calls upon the Community to monitor the economic and social development of the populations of the areas in question, because that is where we will achieve most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have dealt with the problem of organised crime in the European Union and there is a specific reason why we are doing so today in an urgent debate: the murder in Brindisi on 24 February of two officials of the <span class="italic">Guardia di Finanza </span>has again suddenly brought to light the danger faced by our colleagues in the security bodies of the Member States whose job is to protect the external borders of the European Union or work in regions which, because they are adjacent to the external borders of the European Union, are breeding grounds for organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Our colleagues in the public police departments do not only deserve our full solidarity and respect; above all, we owe it to them to acknowledge once and for all that, wherever we live in the European Union, officials of the <span class="italic">Guardia di Finanza</span> in Apulia, for example, and I say this as a German member of parliament, are protecting the territory and the citizens of my country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we in this European Parliament owe it to the relatives of the victims to acknowledge that respect for the dead is not an Italian but a European matter. That is the first point which I wished to make here.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is a political challenge which, in my view, we are not taking seriously enough. We talk of the need to combat organised crime efficiently and yet we too frequently overlook the fact that the European internal market which we ourselves have created, with freedom of movement of services, capital, goods and persons, has created a huge free zone of economic activity in which, wherever legal transactions can be freely conducted, illegal transactions can also be freely conducted. In creating this huge legal economic area, we have also created a huge illegal economic area and it is now possible to operate on a large scale throughout the whole of Europe for the purposes of smuggling, trafficking in human beings, credit card fraud, drug trafficking, prostitution and every other possible form of serious crime.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the police counter-strategies needed still mainly come within the jurisdiction of the nation states. The instruments to fight organised crime are organised at intergovernmental level. Where I live, in the district of Aachen, there is a town called Herzogenrath. The Netherlands are on one side of the street and Germany is on the other and if you rob a bank on the German side and escape to the Dutch side in time, then you are lucky because no German police is allowed to follow you. This is a practical example of the difficulties inherent in the fight against organised crime and clearly illustrates the need for a cross-border, or rather a pan-European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I wish to make is that, when it comes to serious crime which can only be combated at a pan-European level, the European Union needs independent operational powers for the European police agencies under the control of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, as politicians in the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we owe it to those who fall victim to increasing organised crime to create the instruments needed to fight organised crime efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the events taking place in Puglia and the South of Italy are not at all romantic. Quite the opposite. The tragic death of two customs and excise officers is a European issue as well as a question of Italian public safety, and it is not just a question of European safety, but also, and above all, an issue which has a bearing on our relations with our neighbours across the Adriatic. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia. The actions of the local authorities and our initiatives to assist them are absolutely vital elements in the fight against organised crime, and are therefore also crucial for the safety of Europeans. We regret that the joint resolution did not take up our suggestion to make the new reconstruction programmes conditional upon an undertaking by the governments of the former Yugoslavia to cooperate actively in the fight against organised crime. However, we hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to mobilise these governments through their endeavours and that an effective action of this kind will be instigated at the Conference scheduled for 19 and 20 May, in which both institutions are to take part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is attempting to enlarge its borders and create an area of freedom, security and justice. The Adriatic is a border and so is the Ionian Sea. If we want to give weight to the processes of European enlargement, we must reassure our citizens, our fellow citizens who live in those areas, that our words are not just hot air but authentic projects which will genuinely affect their situation, and that, when we talk of law and security, we will provide them with the necessary means, conditions and systems. We have already paid too high a price in deaths – too many civilians gave their lives in the raids in Puglia – and we have lost too many men from the forces of law and order. In consideration also of the existence of the Stability Pact, we need to take practical steps to show that the enlargement of Europe will also mean greater security for our people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it is only natural – and I was the rapporteur for enlargement to the east and internal security – that we need to worry about higher security standards, not only in the candidate countries, as we do in the EU itself, but of course in all other European countries. We need a pan-European system of internal security, and here the Balkans are naturally a special cause for concern because we have assumed responsibility in Kosovo and the neighbouring regions. On the other hand, however, we must take care not to classify certain peoples in a particular manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore against point 4 of the joint resolution which names Montenegro. Of course, Montenegro also has internal security problems, as we do in the EU for that matter. But Montenegro presently faces a huge threat; as you will have heard, and as officially confirmed by NATO yesterday, Milosevic has again started military operations against Montenegro. We must be careful not to give him an excuse. Therefore, solidarity in the fight against organised crime, yes, but please, no specific passage on Montenegro; just support for Montenegro in its struggle for greater freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lavarra (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I consider the consensus reached in this Chamber on the need for a new initiative to fight organised crime very important, in particular because of the realisation which spread from the Group on behalf of which I am speaking, that the dramatic events in Brindisi are not just an issue which is confined to the Region of Puglia, but that they draw on values, principles and objectives which are an integral part of the new European policy and on the question of justice and security for the citizens of the Union. Parliament and the institutions of the Union must take due account of this perspective and provide a rational response to the fear and insecurity experienced by the citizens in the face of crime, and it must fight all aspects of crime, including those who resort to brutal violence with no qualms about killing the forces of law and order and defenceless citizens, and the supranational financial and economic criminal organisations. </p>
<p class="contents">The links between criminal groups in different countries and the increasingly wide geographical spread of crime call for a supranational response. After all, security is one of Europe’s objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam and was on the agenda of the European Council held in Tampere in the autumn of 1999. We hope that substantial decisions similar to those proposed in Tampere will be taken regarding the creation of common investigation groups, a European police academy and a genuine European judiciary such as EUROJUS. This is the path we must take, taking due account of the fight against crime taking place in the Balkan States in our relations with these countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I also express my sympathy for the families of the victims and recognise before this Chamber the extreme sense of duty shown by those two officers in that tragic event which took place on 24 February. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – The Commission has examined with great interest the resolution concerning the threat posed by the development of illicit activities of criminal groups operating in several countries of south-eastern Europe. We share the preoccupation expressed in the resolution as to the risk of seeing the reconstruction and development efforts in the context of the Stability Pact being jeopardised by international criminal networks that engage mainly in trafficking in human beings, trafficking in drugs and arms as well as in smuggling of goods. Clearly a lot of these criminal activities have serious negative consequences for the Community and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the European Council has shown its strong determination to fight against organised crime and has demonstrated the need for a coherent and coordinated approach by adopting in June 1997 an Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime. Although many actions envisaged aim to encourage cooperation between the fifteen Member States, the plan does not neglect the need also to develop wider forms of international cooperation. The tangible result has been the conclusion by the Council in 1998 of the Pre-accession Pact on cooperation against crime with the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific question raised by the resolution and related to the situation in the Balkans, the Commission agrees that there is a real danger of massive development of organised crime activities if no coherent and coordinated action is set up in this region associating the various donors as well as the international and regional actors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the Member States have a crucial role to play in providing their expertise and human resources in supporting specialised projects in the fight against various criminal activities in the Balkan region, including the fight against corruption. The Commission considers that it can prove and provide a useful input to the Stability Pact by combining the Member States’ expertise and the Community funds in order to set up well-targeted anti-crime projects and activities. In this respect, the Commission is also ready to act as a coordinator and in close consultation with the special coordinator of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have to underline that the Commission is preparing a proposal for a new specific financial instrument which will provide a global legal basis for the Community assistance to the whole region. An official proposal will be presented to the Council by the end of this month and we hope that a new regulation will come into force as soon as possible, hopefully just after the summer break.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains convinced of the crucial importance of making all the necessary efforts to support effective measures for the fight organised crime and is determined to develop, within this new framework, regional projects covering the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is already in a position to announce that, under its programming of the assistance envelope of regional programmes for 2000, around EUR 2 m have been earmarked for projects within the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards trafficking in certain goods such as the smuggling of cigarettes, and insofar as this traffic also affects the Community's territory and its financial interests, OLAF has set up multi-disciplinary and multinational task groups. These groups work to combat organised crime whose transnational dimension has been demonstrated on several occasions. They have been established to provide support and operational assistance that focuses its investigations on the sectors and products which are most vulnerable to fraud, which is the case for cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the activities of these task groups recorded over the last few years are particularly significant. In 1996, for instance, cigarette smuggling, mainly in the transit regime, totalled ECU 800 m. The overall financial impact of fraud detected in this area in 1997 was an estimated ECU 1.6 bn covering Community own resources and national revenue. The number of inquiries against cigarette smuggling even increased in 1998, although the financial impact was lower than in the previous years. This can be explained by the continuation of large international inquiries and the success in the fight against cigarette smuggling from Andorra and against the black market in Spain. All in all we take these threats to the Community very seriously and will continue working hard to fight them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
