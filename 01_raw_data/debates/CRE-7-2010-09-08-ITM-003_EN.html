<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Didier Reynders, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, the meeting of the ECOFIN Council, which has just taken place in Brussels, has enabled us to make progress on two issues, by adopting the European Semester, within the framework of budgetary consolidation and of the new budget monitoring procedures, and also by endorsing the agreement reached during a trialogue with the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, of course, on all the financial supervision texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, we have launched two debates, which will be continued at the end of this month at the informal ECOFIN Council meeting and with which we hope to make progress over the next six months: one on the bank resolution funds, or bank levy, and the other on the tax on financial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words on both these points. With regard to the European Semester, this is a first step and one which will enable us, from 1 January next year, to introduce the new budgetary procedure with the Commission. We will call on the Member States, in spring, to submit certain budgetary data, the parameters used to prepare their budgets, the broad guidelines – without any detailed examination of each heading – before we continue with this procedure. We also hope to be able to add further provisions, among other things, and here I am thinking about provisions relating to sanctions. In any event, the Presidency will support the process by which to impose these sanctions, at the initiative of the Commission and, if possible, with a specific role being given to the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to supervision, I wanted, once again, to thank the rapporteurs and all the Members who participated in this attempt to reach a consensus on the various texts, and also the Commission, Michel Barnier and his teams, as well as the successive Presidencies. I am referring here to the Spanish and the Swedish Presidencies, which preceded us. We now have texts which, from 1 January next year, will enable us to establish new surveillance and supervision structures and the Systemic Risk Board. This process will enable us to make progress under the right conditions, with a new architecture for the financial system and its supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to point out that, although this has indeed been a long process, we have not finished yet; rather, this is the beginning of a new kind of European organisation and, very likely, the beginning of lengthy debates which will result in the adoption of various texts, which Commissioner Barnier will have the opportunity to present over the coming weeks. We are going to try to keep to a strict timetable on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now dealt with the two points which were the subject of formal decisions taken by the ECOFIN. Moreover, debates have been held, as I was saying, on two other issues: the first on bank resolution funds, or the bank levy, and the second – the debates must be kept very separate – on the tax on financial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, where the bank levy and the bank resolution funds are concerned, the debate which took place during the ECOFIN meeting yielded a number of guidelines which will enable the Commission to present more detailed and more specific proposals. I am convinced that, by applying the same proactive approach that we applied to financial supervision, we should be able to conclude this debate over the coming months with the creation of mechanisms which will ensure real coordination across Europe. Some countries have already imposed a levy on the banking sector, but it is important for us to progress in a coordinated fashion. I acknowledge that there are still some issues to be addressed. We will, in fact, be discussing these at finance minister level during the informal Council meeting at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the tax on financial transactions, the debate is much livelier. We have further to go in reaching a consensus, but that is normal. This was an initial in-depth debate which allowed for specific questions to be asked about the ability to implement such a tax, but also about the ability to implement it in the EU or to discuss it with other partners. We will also revisit this issue at the end of this month in preparation for the G20 meetings, because it is clearly important for the majority of participants that we discuss it with our partners, not only on the other side of the Atlantic, but also in emerging countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I will simply say that many determined efforts still need to be made on this issue, and then choices will have to be made. If a tax of this type is introduced one day, how will the receipts be used? Some will earmark them for their national budgets, others will finance measures necessary to combat climate change, while others – and in Belgium, for example, we have already done this – will use them to finance development.</p>
<p class="contents">There we are, Madam President; that is what I have to report on the Council meeting that has just taken place in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, I, in turn, after Mr Reynders, would like to say a few words about our approach to this Ecofin Council meeting. I will do so on behalf of my fellow Commissioners, Olli Rehn and Algirdas Šemeta, who participated in this work with me.</p>
<p class="contents">Four points marked this meeting, as the Belgian minister has pointed out. Since Parliament has played a very large part in this, please allow me to begin with a major subject that I consider structural and to which I have devoted much of my energy ever since you placed your trust in us in February. I am talking about supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">That is because supervision is the cornerstone, the framework within which, brick by brick, week after week, product after product, market after market or actor after actor, we will be able to learn the lessons of the crisis and put in place intelligent regulation and effective supervision, so that at the end of the journey – and we are not there yet – no actor, no product, no market and no territory will escape from intelligent regulation and effective supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to offer a very sincere word of thanks on this subject – and I am confident that Parliament will, in turn, be able to adopt the outcome of the trialogue in a few weeks’ time – to your rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Skinner, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mrs Goulard, Mr Giegold, Mr Tremosa i Balcells and Mr Balz, and to the committee chair, Mrs Bowles, who managed this trialogue with great determination. I would also like to say that the Belgian President-in-Office, Mr Reynders, played a highly personal and proactive role, relying not only on the work of his team, but also on the work that the Spanish and Swedish Presidencies had done before him.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that the initial reason behind this Commission proposal on supervision was the highly intelligent work carried out by Jacques de Larosière to draw the first main lesson from this crisis. As a result, on 1 January, we will have some European bodies. The Commission will work hard, as is its duty, to prepare the implementation of these three authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board. I talked about European radar screens and control towers. These are clearly needed because, as we know, half of the banks in half of the countries of Europe, which you represent, are based in other countries. Therefore, we are generally dealing with financial establishments that are transnational in nature and, consequently, have systemic dimensions and risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Presidency and to offer my very sincere thanks to Parliament and your rapporteurs for the essential work that they put in to make this ‘very first stage’, as Mr Reynders put it, a success. Now the building work begins.</p>
<p class="contents">You will see that we will be filling out this framework week by week. Starting next week, I will put forward the regulation on derivatives and the regulation on short selling, and then, a little later on, the one on credit rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points for debate that also concern the financial sector, in relation to ideas about contributions and taxation. One is more advanced than the other, and I agree with the Belgian President-in-Office that we should not mix up the two subjects, as they are different, even though they both concern financing by the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is this idea of resolution funds. This is a debate that has already begun in the Council. I must tell the honourable Members that these Council debates are very useful, as I saw for myself yesterday, because the table rounds help one begin to see things a little more clearly. I opened this debate under the Spanish Presidency in Madrid at an informal Council meeting, when I presented the idea of a toolbox for preventing crises in the banking and financial sector with two simple ideas. The first is that prevention is always cheaper than the cure – that is true for the environment and for financial crises as well – while the second simple idea is that taxpayers should no longer be in the front line, because the banks should pay for the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on these ideas, then, we presented the contents of a toolbox, which included resolution funds. In this respect, I would like to emphasise the equally very important work that Mrs Ferreira has done on your behalf. In October, I will issue a communication based on the views of Parliament and Mrs Ferreira and on the reactions from the Council of Ministers. Why in October? Because by then, we will also have made progress on the important Basel process, with the obligations of qualitative and quantitative capitalisation of own funds.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that when we speak of contributions by banks or prevention in banks, all the pieces have to be put together, and we have to pay attention to what I have called the ‘sizing’ of these measures to ensure that they are effective and that no one escapes from them. It will not be business as usual, but at the same time, we must not penalise the economy without looking at the cumulative effect of all these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In October, therefore, I will issue a communication on the prevention of future crises and the responsibility of the banks and the resolution fund, ideas about which are progressing, since Germany has just implemented this idea. Sweden had already done so. We are going to try to build a coordinated system with a common core, which will avoid poor coordination, or even competition, and double taxation on banking establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Reynders said, a debate has just begun. This one, on taxing financial transactions at a global level, is much more difficult. The debate started in the G20. Not everyone was enthusiastic. Many of us think that it is a fair idea and that, in a modest but effective way, financial transactions ought to be able to contribute to the funding of a number of major worldwide challenges to make the world a fairer and therefore more stable and secure place. This world we live in will only be more secure if it is fairer, which is not the case today.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of all the challenges – like the environment, climate change and food – and the crises, which, moreover, hit the poorest countries the hardest. Many of us think it is a fair idea, but it is a long way from gaining a consensus in the Council of Ministers, to say the least. We will have to carry on working on it. My fellow Commissioner, Algirdas Šemeta, has written an initial information memo and, on the basis of the work done in the Council of Ministers, we will draw up a new communication on taxation of the financial sector in particular. This communication is scheduled for October.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat what Mr Reynders has said about the stability and convergence programme, the efforts made by the Commission and the work done by the task force. I will just mention the idea – which I find useful – of a European Semester, which will put the budgetary analysis of each of our countries into perspective while preserving their sovereignty, and will provide a snapshot – another European radar screen – of the countries’ general economic policy guidelines. The Council will also work on the basis of the Commission’s papers and reports on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">At dinner, Mr Reynders raised two points for discussion, which I will describe in brief. One of them, which concerns me and all of us here, is the operation of the IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board. We would like to see a reform of its governance and greater transparency. I have also told the Presidency that I am ready to table a report of interest to Parliament about transatlantic regulation at the September informal Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not alone within the G20, and not even among Americans and Europeans, but it is extremely important for us to ensure that there is parallelism between the measures taken under President Obama’s authority by the US Congress and the measures taken by Europe as regards supervision and regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am currently setting up a kind of scoreboard comparing what is being done in the United States at the moment with what we are doing in Europe to ensure such parallelism. It is a question of achieving the same objectives without necessarily using the same methods or measures. I believe it will be a useful tool for the ministers and for the Members of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is an important milestone. A number of Member States initially dug their heels in, but our rapporteurs have been steadfast and, thanks to a persuasive Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency’s firm line, we were able to secure this result. Another positive result has been the introduction of the European Semester. Both are important steps towards strengthening economic governance in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ECOFIN Council, you have also debated various forms of bank taxes, because banks, too, must contribute to dealing with the impact of the crisis. You have rightly tried to achieve this at G20 level, but with little progress. For this reason, the EPP Group agrees with the conclusion that, if we fail to achieve this internationally, then we in Europe can – no, must – take the lead by introducing a bank tax or a bank levy. However, we must do this in a coordinated fashion, because Member States are already introducing such levies themselves and that is posing a threat to our internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner Barnier, I would strongly encourage you to use your right of initiative to bring about a coordinated bank levy across Europe, one that will be introduced according to the same criteria in every country. In this matter, just as in the matter of European supervision, this House will rally to your side.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the financial transaction tax, now, that is an excellent item which you will have to work hard to place much more prominently on the G20 agenda. However, one thing I would warn you against is Europe going solo. I know that my fellow Member, Mr Schulz, would like to enforce such a transaction tax in Europe, but its disadvantages would outweigh the advantages, because we are dealing with a global system. Such a tax would lead to transactions bypassing Europe. We should, therefore, put our efforts into introducing a successful European bank tax and continue to operate in the G20 context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has worked hard on this issue and you have also played your part, which is why the results are so good.</p>
<p class="contents">We must always look to new tasks and, unfortunately, I must point out that good results are still a long way off in other areas. Let me just say that the regulation of hedge fund managers is still nowhere near a breakthrough. At this point, I would call on both sides, both the Council and the Commission, to get cracking. After all, without your efforts, the regulations will not be of much use. We need equal rights for all. Managers outside the European Union must always be subject to the same conditions as their European counterparts. Otherwise, we are putting Europe at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our aim to put a whole industry behind bars. However, if we do not achieve meaningful improvements that will prevent the black sheep from plundering well-functioning businesses, we are not going to have good regulation. I want to issue this warning: you should not imagine that you will score an easy victory by simply playing the various Members of this House off against each other. If you fail to introduce effective regulation, the whole of Europe will know who it was who went down on bended knee before the lobbyists and that knowledge will give these discussions a different character.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about the financial transaction tax: My view of this is diametrically opposed to that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Europe is waiting for answers. You will have to provide these answers. Do not come back from the G20 summit and tell us: ‘Unfortunately we have achieved nothing, so now there is nothing we can do.’ On the contrary, we need to take action in Europe, which is why we need to plan and implement some decisive measures together with the people in Europe. Remember one thing during your negotiations at the G20 summit: we need a response from you, otherwise there is going to have to be a European response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know we are now thanking one another but I should like nonetheless to emphasise that it was fortunate that Parliament pointed out, last December, how the Member States, while claiming they wanted to resolve the crisis using European solutions, were busy implementing every safety net and every safeguard clause imaginable to ensure that these European authorities could definitely not act without intergovernmental agreements. I think that we have all worked very well together, but let us give praise where praise is due.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Systemic Risk Board, I should like to highlight in particular one extremely positive point. Mr Barnier frequently refers to radars and control towers, but each aircraft also has a pilot, and that pilot is the President of the European Central Bank, whom Parliament is very keen to see remain in that role.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to express a slight feeling of dissatisfaction with regard to the direct supervision of pan-European entities and, above all, ask you to continue the fight in that regard. In the sectoral texts, we must continue – as the four main groups in Parliament have jointly undertaken to do – to provide the EU Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) with powers over these entities, over the rating agencies. This is theoretically already happening, and we are waiting for the Commission to continue its work and to extend it to clearing houses and, eventually, to cross-border groups. The challenge in this area was simple: we could either have an internal market subject to EU regulation and supervision, or settle for loose coordination, which would mean quibbling – or <span class="italic">chipotage</span>, as we say under the Belgian Presidency – between nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved a lot by working together on this issue. I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, the Commission, Mr Barnier, and my fellow Members from the various groups. We have taken a really enormous step forward, giving the lie to all those who said that Europe would no longer progress any further. On the contrary, we need to introduce stringent regulations for the internal market. We are now on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the Ecofin Council has already made some important decisions in relation to the monitoring of the budgets of Member States. I would like to thank the Commission for the progress made. You have presented a number of proposals. We are now awaiting more proposals in relation to macro-economic coordination. Given the crisis, this is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would now like to discuss the financial transaction tax. What we have heard from the Commission so far is a cacophony of contradictory signals. On the one hand, Mr Barnier and Mr Barroso are thankfully in support of the idea of a financial transaction tax. At the same time, Mr Šemeta rejects the proposal. I am calling on you to deal with this issue in a collegial way. You must speak with one voice. It simply will not do for Mr Šemeta to present a report containing results that have long been refuted in academic circles.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, there was some relevant information to be found in the study the European Parliament commissioned from the Bruegel Institute. This study refutes relevant arguments raised by Mr Šemeta. I also wonder why he is not here. He has been criticised several times in the House on this issue. Today of all days, he should face up to this debate. I also wonder whether he will now have to stay behind after class – after all, that is what has been decided: his contribution will have to be revised. Is this really going to result in a proposal to be presented by the Commission, an initiative they intend to present, or are we just to have another study document? This really is not good enough! Something else that is not good enough is to postpone the Council’s decision until France has the Presidency of the G20 Group. This is not acceptable!</p>
<p class="contents">However, the central countries that have rejected this proposal, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Spain, also have questions to answer. It was already known that the United Kingdom and Sweden would not be in favour. However, Spain is a member of the Euro Group. The country is governed by Social Democrats. Perhaps they should seek to establish more coherence between the good position they have adopted in this House and the positions adopted by the Spanish Government in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all I can say is that I would like greater clarity from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) here in this House regarding their position. You have just made some extremely critical comments about the financial transaction tax, although large parts of your group are in favour. I am not convinced that you are really speaking for the majority of your group. We need united action in this situation, otherwise our citizens will become cynical if we are to have cost-saving measures on the one hand, but no revenue from levying capital income in Europe on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I would like to turn to those unresolved issues of financial transactions at yesterday’s ECOFIN.</p>
<p class="contents">I seem to spend a lot of my time in Parliament asking for people to conduct research, write impact assessments and do studies. This week’s ECOFIN has gone out and done just that. Instead of looking at purely political concepts and legislating in haste, the Council meeting and Commissioner Šemeta’s contributions have been based on facts and figures. A good example of better regulation principles in practice. However, when an independent assessment states that one Member State would end up collecting in excess of 70% of the revenue generated from a financial transaction tax, it would be ludicrous to claim that such a tax should be implemented at an EU level, if at all.</p>
<p class="contents">An FTT is not free money, as the popular media would have us believe. The banks and financial intermediaries would not be the ones to pay for a transaction tax. It would be the pensioners reliant on their returns in the market and companies in the real economy paying for every hedging transaction. It is time to recognise the limitations of the simplistic FTT and, if our true aim is to modify the behaviour of banks without destroying our economies, look at the more complex solution of a financial activities tax or bank levies as proposed by the IMF instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of derailing the process by calling for unachievable and unwanted EU-wide taxes that many Member States, not just my own, are against, we must look at this as an opportunity for strengthening our Members States’ weak public finances and allowing them to use the money as they see fit, replenishing their public coffers depleted by bank bail-outs and crisis management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question is this: have they given any thought to democracy? I am all in favour of coordination. I accept goals for the deficit, and I would even like to see such goals put in place for job creation. I accept amendments to the national budgets, although I would prefer it if the sanctions were not stupid and did not exacerbate the problem, so I am quite open to this.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find completely unacceptable is Brussels deciding how the Member States are to meet their commitments, because this means expropriating the fundamental prerogatives of national parliaments. Ecofin will have more than prior approval; it is setting out the guidelines that are to govern every national budget. I heard Mr Reynders say: OK, but we will not go into detail about this. Thank you for your magnanimity, but the basic problem is that the main guidelines will apply to 27 governments. Of these 27 governments, Germany will always be telling Greece what it has to do, but not vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the members of national parliaments are not blanks that need to be filled in. Members of national parliaments cannot simply be divorced from freedom of choice in their budgets, which is a crucial political choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the process that you are pursuing with such enormous dedication, I would call on you urgently to make the matter clear to our citizens by outlining the reason for the failure despite all the good will shown, and by explaining why we have only made limited progress on the four cornerstones that are central to the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent that we need clarity on why the supervision of the financial markets in the US is stricter and more critical in key areas than what you are trying to establish now. We also need clear answers as to how you actually intend dealing with the problem of the conduit banks and what degree of success we can expect there. We also need clarifications in relation to capital. What is the Commission’s intention? There is plenty of detail here, but how do you intend making sure that a crash cannot happen again?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask a question as a representative of a small Member State: What can we do to limit the problem of banks that are too big to fail? In Austria, we have a situation with one bank, Hypo Group Alpe Adria, where, if the loans were to be called in, the burden of debt on the Austrian state would be so high that we would find ourselves in the same category as Greece.

<p class="contents">As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we face a broad challenge today. No one can or should stop the imposition of stricter budgetary discipline and stricter supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge is to design a new economic model which responds to the demand of European citizens for full employment and fair growth. We therefore need to strike a balance between budgetary discipline and safeguarding the necessary resources for sustainable growth and full employment through public and private investments.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to address macro-economic balances and the competitive divide between the Member States which will inevitably lead to economic and social inequalities. Above all, however, we need a model for the fairer distribution of the cost of recovery and fiscal justice and taxing financial transactions could play a catalytic role.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can and must play a leading role on this issue. It did so in combating climate change by making unilateral commitments. It can and must lead efforts to promote similar regulations at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are, however, a couple of issues. We support introducing a form of coordinated stability level and a fund, but when it comes to the financial transaction tax, we are talking about an entirely different and much more complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">That tax, as a minimum, would have to be global to avoid tax evasion. Furthermore, a tax on all transactions might not only be technically infeasible, but would also risk making the markets more volatile and less liquid.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some questions on taxes. If the purpose is to generate money for global causes, which money pots does the revenue go into, and who has the responsibility for distributing the money? For a tax for a specific purpose, when do we ever know when enough is enough? Finally, the key question is who will collect the tax – the Member States or the EU? If it is the EU, far away from its citizens, how do we prevent constant rising taxes? In the real world, enough never seems to be enough when it comes to politicians’ need for additional money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope everything is well with you. As regards the bank levy, I do not, in principle, have any problems with it at all. I just wonder how it is supposed to work in practice. It reminds me of a bus: everyone wants to get on it, but everyone wants to go in a different direction. As for the financial transaction tax, I think it is a good example of a bad idea. It is basically a sort of European Tobin tax. Although, we do not call it that any more, because nowadays even Mr Tobin himself is opposed to that tax. It scares capital away and Sweden has been a very good example of that. This also begs the question of what we are going to do with the revenue from such a tax? Are we going to use it to contribute to the EU’s own resources? This issue is bound to be very divisive, so my advice to you, Mr Reynders, is: there might be very good intentions behind your plan, but please drop it. Put the plan on ice or, better still, leave it outside to die of hypothermia. Surely, we cannot just go solo. Now, I would like to pick up on what Mr Schulz has said, although he does not appear to be listening to me right now. Yesterday, he said that he would like to force the European Commission to take the initiative on the financial transaction tax. He wants to bring people out onto the streets. My advice would be, do not go down that route. We will take a European citizens’ initiative against this tax because it is the ordinary man on the street who will have to pay it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I must say that I find it regrettable such an important Ecofin meeting as yesterday’s was held at the same time as the address by the President of the Commission on the state of the Union. I would expect better coordination. If we are all to pull in the same direction, we need to be aware of the topics and highlights that concern the European Union; we need to coordinate our efforts, listen to each other and talk to one another. Such parallel scheduling is entirely unnecessary and does a disservice to both events.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I would like to mention is supervision. I would like to thank the Presidency of the Council, the Commissioner and Parliament. If it were not for the decision by Parliament in July, progress would never have been made over the summer and we would not have supervision with teeth. If it were not for the decision by Parliament in July, the President of the European Central Bank would not be heading up the macro-supervision authority. These matters were tightened up through the active cooperation of Parliament and the Belgian Presidency with the support of the Commission. I would like to thank you warmly for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is in relation to the Europeanisation of the drafting of the budget. We must be aware that the second pillar of monetary union will only work if we pursue economic and social union and europeanise budgetary policy and taxation policy as a first step, rather than simply coordinating them.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that, while we need a bank levy, this should not be allowed to become a bottomless pit. The levy should have a European objective and be ring-fenced for European purposes and the European Monetary Fund should be established.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is in relation to the financial transaction tax. By now, those in favour and those against the tax must feel like they have been going around in circles to no avail. Mr Reynders, you have just commented that this has been the first serious debate on the issue. However, we have been talking about it for a year. We have been asking questions. We have been adopting resolutions. First you seem to shift responsibility to the G20, then to the Commission and finally to the Member States. We want these five questions to be answered. What is to be the basis for assessment? What is the percentage rate to be? Who will impose the levy? Who is going to get the money and what for? Present a project to us, then we can discuss the matter further and finally do something practical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Growth and employment need to be priorities, as well as fulfilment of the Stability and Growth Pact. The creation of the European Monetary Fund is crucial. Sovereign debt needs to be handled alongside all the other obligations for participation in a monetary area. It is vital that the development of this project does not go down the dangerous route of sanctions, and I am counting on Commissioner Barnier and his experience to guide the Commission in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would also like to congratulate him sincerely on the financial supervision work that he has carried out. I believe that Commissioner Barnier, in particular, along with Parliament and the Belgian Presidency have managed to reach a good agreement: one which respects us and defends the interests of the European public. My hope is that the missing agenda will follow the same methodology and that we will achieve the same success.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to say that I very much hope that when it comes to the banking crisis, particularly for systemic and cross-border banks, any progress will help to consolidate the European position.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, it is essential to revisit our agenda for the G20, especially if we do not want to give up the fight against fraud, tax evasion and tax havens, and if we want there to be an effective and more decisive contribution from banks and financial services ...</p>

<p class="contents">More Europe to create growth and employment, to regulate the markets and to reduce inequality. This is the contention of my group chair, Mr Daul, and one which I fully support. I believe that Member States have finally realised that we needed to be bolder in economic and budgetary matters. Bolder and, above all else, responsible: national protectionist responses are a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">We need greater financial supervision at European level; the agreement with the Council on the financial supervision package, which we will vote on at the next plenary session, is excellent news in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as well as supervising the system, we must establish real coordination of our budgetary and economic policies. We must create both budgetary federalism and economic federalism. Having a common monetary policy but independent budgetary policies paralyses us. I think that federalism has begun with this new European Semester, which requires Member States to submit their budgetary strategies before the summer each year to the Council for its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as is often the case at EU level, what happens in practice will determine the rules much more than texts. For my part, I want this coordination to be more than just a formal exercise and to result in a true common strategy for our economic, industrial and social policies. I regret that the national parliaments and the European Parliament are not yet fully involved in this coordination process.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister, as a representative of the Council, I am therefore addressing you in particular: parliaments, as budgetary authorities, must play an essential role in the emergence of a European economic policy, as that is the only way to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also need a coherent, robust and credible European prevention, management and crisis resolution system.

I hope our work on Solvency II and its implementing measures will be more productive and much faster. I trust that will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many positives which have been pointed out already today – and many negatives – but I would like to agree with the progress that has already been made and what we should aim for. Europe though – and not just the eurozone, it has to be said – needs performance-enhancing regulations as well as safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling that nations are being made to feel like outcasts, and this must be stopped. It is self-destructive for the EU as a whole. The international agenda is key. The European Union has got to play a significant and crucial role in creating global standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that if we believe that creating standards in Europe alone is enough, we will make a grave error. That is why I welcome Commissioner Barnier’s remarks about table for the European Union and the USA of comparative regulatory achievement. My office has already drawn up such a table. I would be very happy to share the contents of that with you, Commissioner. I hope it will be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I might ask: where are we in dealing with the Transatlantic Economic Council, the higher-level regulatory dialogue? Where do we expect to go in the future? We have problems before us we cannot solve on our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a federalist, I can only welcome such progress. However, coordinating budgetary policy is one thing; defining their content is another. That is why strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is a serious mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The austerity treatment dogmatically imposed on the whole of Europe is already making its initial effects felt. Spain and Ireland are experiencing ever more difficulties, and the Markit survey, published at the end of August, shows that this treatment is responsible for the stagnation in European growth and, before long, the stagnation in German growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The series of repressive measures outlined on the agenda of the next informal ECOFIN meeting is even more serious. Imposing automatic financial sanctions on States that are already facing budget problems is irresponsible. It will inevitably fuel the criticisms in all the Member States with regard to their national contributions to the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Two and a half million citizens expressed the first opposition to the austerity package on the streets of France yesterday. Instead of preserving social safety nets and establishing the social harmony in the EU that is necessary for the recovery, the Council and the Commission are destroying them. Do they measure the impact of such decisions only by the increasing level of Euroscepticism among citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of European integration and of the citizens for whom it is being undertaken, it must be acknowledged, ladies and gentlemen, that strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact is an economic aberration. It is also a serious political mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, I think, safer under the new arrangements. The experience of the European Central Bank allows us to look to the future with optimism, and the establishment of the European system of financial supervision bodies should be treated as a step in the right direction. We have begun in earnest the coordination of policy on spending, and are not interested only in collecting taxes in Europe. The reporting system will be very important.

<p class="contents">The economic and social model, a particular feature of the European Union, is proving to be untenable at the moment. Initially regarded as a driving force for economic growth, as well as for social protection, it has failed to realise these expectations. Ten per cent of Europeans are out of work, while some Member States are still deep in recession.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have shortcomings when it comes to controlling economic flows in the EU, which have been clearly highlighted by the economic crisis. This makes macro-economic supervision of Europe’s economies a necessity, especially as the latter are closely linked through the single market and single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the ECOFIN conclusions on establishing a basis for macro-financial supervision in the European Union, with the help of setting up the European Systemic Risk Board and the supervisory authorities for the banking, insurance and securities sectors, not to mention the monitoring of national budgets within a European Semester. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While speculators continue to help themselves to scandalous salaries and effective taxation of financial transactions remains elusive, with tax havens flourishing, they have seized the opportunity provided by the crisis to launch the biggest attack on democracy yet. They have tried to turn members of national parliaments into European puppets in order to force national budgets towards preliminary examination by Europe’s leaders, as though the clearly conditional nature of the Stability and Growth Pact and its irrational criteria were not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called ‘economic coordination’ set out in the treaties cannot justify this trampling, whether at European or national level, of the Member States’ sovereignty, at this painful time in their economic and social development. They have gone too far in defending the interests of economic and financial groups, and this will have serious consequences for those in poverty within the European Union. This is why we are protesting here, and we are certain that the struggle of the workers and people of the European Union is going to intensify. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to return to what Mrs Ferreira just said about our citizens being shaken, affected by all these financial, economic and social crises, without forgetting the food and environmental crises. I believe that we must make a point of demonstrating to our citizens that we are learning lessons from the crisis, because they are the people who elect you, and we are accountable to them. This is what we have just done with regard to supervision; we just need to communicate and explain it, which is what we have started to do. Here I am thinking about Mrs McCarthy’s report on CRD III and remuneration. I believe that, when it comes to all of the issues that have shocked, shaken and affected our citizens and elected representatives, we, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, must demonstrate that we are providing EU-level responses, and specific responses at that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the tax on transactions, Commissioner Šemeta has completed a very important and useful task in analysing the various options and the consequences of establishing this tax if it were applied on a regional basis only. I think that this is an important task. I would say to Mr Giegold that, at the G20 in Toronto, the President of the Commission clearly took a stand, on our behalf, in favour of an equitable and substantial levy on financial services. We will confirm his position in October. You therefore do not have very long to wait, Mr Karas. I should also like to say to Mrs Figueiredo that this debate is continuing. It is no good us being right on our own. We have to convince the people of Europe and, as Mr Reynders can explain better than I, there is still a long way to go at EU-27 level, an awfully long way to go. Then, the other regions of the world will also need to be convinced.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Swinburne and Mrs Ford, believe that, if this tax is to be truly effective, it must be established on as broad a base as possible. This is why we have to convince the other regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am talking about the world, I should like to say a word about global governance. I can confirm to Mr Skinner that we are going to prepare this comparative table. Furthermore, once this exercise has been completed for the US and the EU, I think it should be extended to the other regions of the world, which I have just mentioned: China, India, Brazil, and Africa as well, which has a contribution to make and is very much affected. I shall therefore make sure I use all the information referred to by Mr Skinner. With regard to governance, which Mrs Podimata and Mr Martin, too, mentioned, we do not yet have the same methods or the same legislation because our economies are very different. Mr Martin quoted Volcker’s famous ‘too big to fail’ strategy. Our analysis in Europe is different: for every bank, irrespective of its size and range of activities, there must be good external and internal supervision and good governance, and the diversity of its activities should not necessarily be curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament clearly plays an essential role with regard to supervision. Mrs Goulard mentioned the work done at your behest to improve the credibility of the agencies. Mr Nitras referred to the key role of the European Central Bank, whose President is going to become the first chair of the Systemic Risk Board, with the task of ensuring that that institution is credible. Mr Karas also mentioned that, thanks to you and to the original and exceptional decision you all took in July to postpone your first-reading vote until autumn, we have had the time to convince and make progress with the Council. I have not forgotten all that and I should like to thank you again.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by mentioning, as Mrs Auconie said, that we need ‘more Europe’. Please allow me to express my conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that we must regulate. We must supervise and learn lessons from the crisis. We must improve public finances, because today’s debts are the taxes of future generations. We must have governance. I am going to finish with a few words on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Governance is not enough. We must also support an economic project. This is what President Barroso wished to say to you very forcefully yesterday, and what we are going to pursue. It is also the context in which you will have to interpret the proposals we make in the autumn, through the Single Market Act, to improve the functioning of the internal market and to guarantee the 1% or 2% growth which Europe could achieve if the internal market operated better.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude with economic coordination, which many of you have mentioned. I should like to remind you that at the end of this month, Commissioner Rehn and President Barroso will be submitting some fairly strong proposals for action in the area of governance. With regard to the European Semester, mentioned by Mr Portas, Mr Giegold, Mr Karas, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mr Cutaş and Mrs Auconie, you clearly have the political will to support this new method of coordination, of radar screens, of real-time snapshots, of proactive action towards governments while respecting, Madam President, the prerogatives and the sovereignty of national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is very important. I was a member of the French Parliament and a senator for 20 years. I would have been very happy if, when I voted on my country’s budget, I had been given an independent and objective overview of what was happening in other countries, how they were achieving – sometimes alone and using different methods – the same jointly agreed objectives and disciplines.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like you to know that, as far as all these coordination and governance issues are concerned, the Commission does have the political will and that Commissioner Rehn’s door is always open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many people have said, this has been a joint effort by Parliament – particularly by its rapporteurs – the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said a moment ago, we are at the start of a process and, in order to demonstrate that this supervision really represents added value and perhaps the first lesson learned from the financial crisis, we must first make sure that the individuals who will be in charge of this supervision are chosen as objectively as possible – and I believe that the procedures adopted are along these lines – and then, if we want, as many people in this Chamber have requested, to move towards supervision that is increasingly European in scope, we must demonstrate the effectiveness of that supervision in the various areas. We will be able to progress even further simply by demonstrating the effectiveness of European-level supervision. I repeat, however: establishing this new architecture is probably the first and most important lesson learned from the financial crisis. It is now up to us to make it work as well as possible and to strengthen, I repeat, step by step, the truly European character of this new supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment I wish to make – Mr Gauzès alluded to it a moment ago – is that, this afternoon, we will once again be working in a trialogue; we will be discussing investment funds further. I believe that everyone needs to take action and agree to the same process which we have just successfully carried out in the area of financial supervision. It is true that there are still some hold-ups within the Council, and debates are taking place within your Chamber on certain aspects relating to the changes to investment funds, but this is an issue on which progress must be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, together with Commissioner Barnier, we really want to set a tight deadline for the entry into force of new texts. With regard to investment funds – we will try to make progress starting from this afternoon – we must adopt the same approach and try to establish a framework that is a European framework and which actually protects citizens and consumers with regard to certain products and activities that are developed in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say that, in order to assess how the work is progressing in the area of regulation and supervision, Commissioner Barnier has announced the intention, during the informal ECOFIN Council meeting, to compare, in a way, what is happening on both sides of the Atlantic. I should like to confirm to you that I intend to invite the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, during this informal ECOFIN meeting, to address this issue and to debate the progress of the work, which involves not only the Council and the Commission but also Parliament. At the end of this month, we will therefore have an opportunity to discuss this issue with Parliament also. It is important to acknowledge the changes that we too are making, on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element I wish to discuss is the taxation of financial transactions – since I do not want to examine the resolution funds again; Commissioner Barnier will, as he has announced, present some specific proposals over the next few weeks. With regard to the taxation of financial transactions, it was almost 10 years ago that I tried, during the previous Belgian Presidency of the Council, to simply raise the issue for debate. We were unable to debate it. There was virtual unanimity amongst the Belgians on this issue. It was the only issue on which unanimity was obtained. This time, the debate has really taken off. I am aware that a number of forceful requests have been made for concrete proposals to be presented on rates, the tax base and the use of receipts. We should perhaps first allow ideas to evolve in a few Member States so that we can really start a debate on practical arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are not going to do, as part of our preparations for the G20, is to refer this issue back to the G20. Rather, we are going to try and identify a number of partners – and they do exist – with which we can move in the same direction. However, I would stress that this debate is going to be actively pursued. It has already been developed at this ECOFIN. We will resume it at the end of the month at the informal ECOFIN meeting, and I should really like us to be able to make progress, including on the allocation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make no mistake: the aim is not to solve crises through the use of this tax. The aim is perhaps, as many have indicated, to combat speculation. It is also to release funds, and we are already using them three or four times over: firstly, to fight climate change, secondly, for development aid, and thirdly, to fill the holes in the budgets. This debate will not be easy, and I acknowledge that we are a long way from reaching an agreement on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish, Madam President, with budgetary consolidation. Let us make no mistake: the European Semester is just one stage. There will be others, and we will be discussing sanctions. The policy just adopted entails debating these mechanisms for the Member States of the euro area to begin with, perhaps, and then seeing how we can extend them, in accordance with the current provisions in the treaties, to Member States that are not in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the idea is to move towards macro-economic convergence and budget consolidation, but I should like to remind you that the pact which binds us in budgetary matters is a Stability and Growth Pact, and that the debate on growth, employment and the social and environmental policies to be conducted in Europe will not be overlooked either.</p>
<p class="contents">This entire budgetary debate is not simply a debate about restoring equilibrium in our various States. It is about seeing which aspect of our budgets will enable us to move not only towards equilibrium but also towards growth, job creation, the development of social policies and active participation – and I stress the word ‘active’ – in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to try and do all this. The Belgian Presidency is obviously ready to make progress on these various issues and, as I said just now, we will be doing that once again this afternoon with regard to investment funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first decision was on the macro-prudential supervision of the financial system, under the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), along with the micro-prudential supervision of banks, insurers and pension funds, and control of real estate values. The second decision was on the ‘European Semester’ as a coordination process for European economic policy. As well as <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> analysis of the comparative budgetary development of the Member States, the European Semester should be seen not as an invasion of national budgetary autonomy but as a way of discussing a broader view of the economy. It does this not only from a financial point of view, but especially by encompassing employment and social inclusion policy. We share this broader vision, and would like to see it developed in the next stages of economic governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial markets have been working across international borders for decades, which is why the financial authorities must finally start to operate on a cross-border basis themselves. However, the implementation of these resolutions requires that national authorities give up some of their competences and de facto transfer these to the Community institutions. However, this is one of the key conditions for creating a fully functioning internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Injections of artificial optimism are contradicted by the Commission’s own figures, which show the capitalist recovery to be feeble, unstable and uncertain. That is why the brutal anti-grassroots attack is being stepped up with additional means and mechanisms: so-called ‘enhanced economic governance’, the ‘European Semester’ for stricter compliance by the Member States with the Stability Pact, faster and more effective promotion of the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy, changes to the EU budget and close monitoring of the Member States’ budgets to ensure the uniform application of drastic cuts in social spending. Nonsense about creating European authorities to supposedly control credit and tax banks and stock exchange trades are fireworks to mislead the grassroots movement and increasing grassroots resistance. The plans prove once again that the anti-labour war which has been unleashed in Greece by the PASOK Government and the EU and other parties of capital is not specific to Greece; it is the strategic choice of capital for the whole of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
