<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors’ test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud. For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer’s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening. Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed. So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success. It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase – they are also committed by those involved in organised crime – it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need – and this is my first recommendation – a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union’s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought – and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 – to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union’s financial interests, and to OLAF’s relationship with the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called <span class="italic">corpus juris</span>, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men. The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority. We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area. This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4). If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused – however you like to put it – the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community’s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well. We are all aware – and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect – of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful. As the French say, "<span class="italic">ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain"</span> [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community’s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand – as Mrs Theato has said – the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report. It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report. One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States – and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget. A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That is where we really get into difficulty. Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?</p>
<p class="contents">We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people. But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions. At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal. People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment. The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question. We are aware that it is a delicate debate. We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties. Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor. But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group. I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage. Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case. We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union’s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law. But the Member States failed to cooperate. This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think. It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity. Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor. My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter. </p>
<p class="contents">I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible. I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic. One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another. This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact. We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Theato’s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions. I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout. Yet, every year we have the same problem. The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud. So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied. It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mrs Theato’s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here. It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF – an independent institution – we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework. We will need the European Public Prosecutor’s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front. I hope that the debate will convince a few more people. Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity. But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato’s report receives more support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system. Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce. Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector – that of the protection of financial interests – without first having created a European legal system. Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are. In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community <span class="italic">corpus iuris</span> in the Treaties. On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens’ rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States. Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Theato’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor. This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.</p>
<p class="contents">But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters. Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF. At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court. In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one. Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific. In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network. And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances. So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place. It is fine, in principle. It need only be fine-tuned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General. Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF. All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.</p>
<p class="contents">And indeed there is a twofold shift. Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor. All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact. Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us. Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future. This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law. The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity. There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level. When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage. Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU’s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe so. On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools. An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit. In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes. It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for. OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this. I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement. It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor’s Office instead. However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office. It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence. Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily. We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice. At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used. Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well? The answer to this is that we know very little about this. The Tampere Summit was about combating crime. Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress. There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted. So a great deal has to be done in this area. And what exactly should be done? </p>
<p class="contents">Two things, and Mrs Theato’s report clearly spells these out. Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union. So, unification in this small area. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor’s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Public Prosecutor’s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on. It is, in fact, something very positive. Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces. This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor’s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament supports this. The Committee of Wise Men supports this. I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue. <span class="italic">Corpus juris</span> is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK. The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about. Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget. But when <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian – to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited – the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a public debate on this. We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed. There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date. It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system. Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress. </p>
<p class="contents">The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato’s report. I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here – and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences – we have become embroiled in legalities. I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2. After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or “body” to quote Mrs Theato. We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis. </p>
<p class="contents">We also face difficulties with regard to offences. Nothing has changed there. As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation. As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome. What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though – and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations – is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights. The proposals in Mrs Theato’s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community. At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino’s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital. </p>
<p class="contents">We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union’s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community’s economic life. Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions. Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States? As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union’s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor? </p>
<p class="contents">Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged. To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required. We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently. At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union’s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States. We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am <span class="italic">not</span> convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime. In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty. We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate. The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered. </p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix. The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration. We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten’s report. The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision. Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision. The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law. This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control. Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this. Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to. On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment. Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995. The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation</p>
<p class="contents">A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud. Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status. This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.</p>
<p class="contents">The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions. It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF. I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point. In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority. No, there must be no undermining of OLAF’s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur’s intention. As such, I would ask you to give OLAF’s work your full support, also in its present form.</p>
