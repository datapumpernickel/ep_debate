<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pollack </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as we know, it is only the most important matters that are dealt with at the midnight hour. We do it particularly so as to keep it a deep, dark secret from the press so that they cannot let anyone know that we really do deal with important matters here that affect people's lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of people are dying every year across Europe as a result of breathing polluted air and one of the main causes of this is traffic. This directive for the first time lays down a set of tough, legally‐binding limits for emissions of the four major pollutants – sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulates and lead – to be met by 2005 and 2010 and based on 1997 guidelines from the World Health Organisation to protect public health. Of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading, 21 out of the 28 were largely accepted by the Council in the common position under the British presidency. These include more public information and an alert threshold for oxides of nitrogen, as well as the one proposed for sulphur dioxide.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council also weakened some of the original Commission proposals. This is a matter of some concern to us in Parliament and so we have tabled 11 amendments to the common position. Some of these amendments simply adjust inaccuracies or anomalies, such as Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 8. Amendment No 4 ensures that action plans for any areas for which a derogation is in operation must also be made available to the public. Amendment No 5 asks that, since the Council did not agree our proposal for an alert threshold for particulates, the Commission should reconsider this when more research is available after the review in 2003. Amendment No 7, sadly, I understand the Commission, amongst others, cannot support and, as a result, the problem of dealing with especially sensitive ecosystems is obviously one of those that will have to be dealt with by action at national level. But we feel in Parliament that it is important to highlight that the World Health Organisation recommended four different levels of limits where the directive only allows for one. We do not feel that is satisfactory so we have retabled that.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we have greater problems are, firstly, on sulphur dioxide. Amendment No 6 restores the original proposal for eight exceedances per year on the hourly limit, which the Council weakened to 24. The Commission acknowledges that this pollutant is directly toxic, especially for asthmatics and those with cardiovascular conditions, even in short peaks of excess pollution, and that is why such a tough limit was proposed in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, therefore, that the Commission will stick to its guns on this, and likewise on Amendment No 2. The insertion by the Council of the words ‘where practicable" is a big problem. I know, for instance, there is a particular difficulty with the French monitoring equipment for producing this ten‐minute averaging figure but, nevertheless, this information is essential for the mid‐term review. In any case Member States are able to choose their own selection of monitoring points so they ought to be able to find a way in which they can actually deal with this difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as oxides of nitrogen are concerned, this is obviously hard for Member States to achieve. It is, of course, one of the key parts of the directive. It is not acceptable for the Council to increase the number of exceedances for the hourly limit value from the original eight up to 18, and Amendment No 9 seeks to restore this. At the very least, it is essential that the Commission look very carefully at this again when it has more research at the 2003 review.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 10 and 11 cover exactly the same sort of problem but for particulates. We know more research is needed and that it is under way. However, the common position text allows ten more permitted exceedances per year on the 24‐hour limit and on the hourly limit and, in effect, pushes the review back so that not a great deal is going to result from that until at least 2010. Although we do not know enough about particulates, we do know that they are a killer and the World Health Organisation is not even able to suggest a safe limit. Given that for particulates we have one derogation for southern dust and another derogation for Nordic road gritting, it must be said that there has to be more political will to tackle this problem in the Member States. There is enough slippage there for people to cope with the very serious problems and they will have to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur I urge the Commission to look again at its strategy, particularly on the last two points and to try and accept some of these amendments. I commend the common position to the House.</p>

During the last debate, the subject of marriage came up, so we have decided to see ourselves as a sort of ‘wedding night climax'. Unfortunately, however, participants in the ‘climax' are rather thin on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, this directive is a good example of the work that is being done to improve European environmental legislation. It has a direct and practical effect on people by making the air cleaner, above all for those who live in our cities. It also provides a means of identifying ways of achieving successful cross‐border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Pollack for her work on this directive, which is a complex document because of its technical nature. She has dealt with the issues in a pragmatic way and has achieved results. We realise that the air we breathe has an effect on health – there is nothing new in that. It is therefore gratifying that we are now drawing up rules which are an improvement on those we have had in the Union up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, our aim is to bring about a further improvement in people's health, and this is what we are calling for. Like a number of others, I too wish this report had gone a little further and imposed stricter controls on the quality of the air we actually breathe. Nevertheless, we regard it as a baseline from which we can all go forward together, although I am aware that many Member States already have stricter standards for air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only does air quality have health implications – which are very important – it also has a bearing on acidification, particularly in the part of Europe I come from. We must therefore look at air quality in general, and not just at the situation in specific areas.</p>
<p class="contents">More emphasis needs to be placed on the effect of particulates on health, since we are not sufficiently well informed about it. I should like to underline the point made by Mrs Pollack that there are a number of important amendments which the Council and Commission need to take on board to ensure that the inhabitants of Europe and of the Union have decent conditions in which to live. It is not enough to say that it is simply not possible. What is required is a strong political will.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flemming </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I am gradually losing any faith in chance. I also believe that the Conference of Presidents, sadly, does not attach very great importance to environmental issues. But some day the people of Europe will call them to account. Parliament is to adopt stricter EU pollution limits in order to ensure better air quality. Just like the previous speakers, I regret that only 21 of the 28 parliamentary amendments adopted at the first reading have been accepted in letter or in spirit. The aim of this directive is therefore to establish emission limits on the basis of the World Health Organisation's air quality guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The report even provides for a very sharp reduction in the limits for particulates, and compliance with the envisaged limits will require a considerable effort in most of the Member States. It lays down uniform methods and criteria, applicable throughout Europe, to help prevent any further harmful effects of atmospheric pollution on human health and the environment. The European Union is thus introducing the strict limits that have long applied in Austria. In some cases, they have turned out to be even stricter. I am pleased about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am by no means entirely happy with all the details of the report. Annex I(I) lays down limits and alarm thresholds for sulphur dioxide, and the proposed limit of 350 grams per cubic metre with 24 overshoots is far too high in my opinion. The reduction envisaged in the maximum number of overshoots from 24 to 8, while not satisfying my wish for a lower concentration limit, is undoubtedly a step in the right direction and will therefore have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">In Annex II(I) on NO<span class="sub">2</span> and NO<span class="sub">x</span> limits and the alarm threshold for nitrogen dioxide, I should welcome the complete deletion of any right to exceed these limits. Here too, the amendment tabled by Mrs Pollack reducing the number of overshoots from 18 to 8 is a step in the right direction and will also have the support of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Mrs Pollack has taken a great deal of trouble with this report, and even though it has not turned out to be everything an environmentalist could wish for, I should like to offer her my sincere congratulations on her report. And finally, my wish for all of us here is that we shall perhaps be able one day to conduct a debate on environmental affairs in the morning.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, cleaner air is a necessity of life, especially for asthma and bronchitis sufferers. Good air quality is also important for the protection of the environment, buildings and vegetation.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures have been taken in Europe to control sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions since the 1970s, with some success. Despite the increased energy consumption, there has been a dramatic fall in emissions of acidifying substances. A reduction of more than 50 % since 1980 is fortunately fairly common for most European countries. It is even likely to be possible to meet the planned SO<span class="sub">2</span> and NO reductions for 2010, thanks to the new standards for vehicle emission gases.</p>
<p class="contents">Particulate matter is a threat to human health. The European Environment Agency has calculated that a reduction in the average PM10 value from 30 micrograms per cubic metre to 20 micrograms per cubic metre would prevent 10 000 premature deaths from particulate poisoning in the EU. The reduction in pollutant emissions by traffic should now be followed by such measures as cleaner fuels and better engines.</p>
<p class="contents">Drastic measures are also required for industry: 30 % of NO emissions come from incinerators, cement ovens, electrical power stations and other factories. New guidelines must therefore take serious account of the need to reduce emissions of particulate matter, NO and SO<span class="sub">2</span> . I congratulate Mrs Pollack on this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I agree of course with the comments which have been made that it would be good if we could also discuss environmental proposals at a time when more Members of Parliament could take part in the debate. But I also agree with the comments and remarks that have been made concerning the importance of this proposal, and I shall at this time be brief and, of course, thank the Committee on the Environment and especially its rapporteur, Mrs Pollack, for the speed and for the insight with which the committee has once again dealt with this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that a large number of the European Parliament's amendments from the first reading were incorporated into the common position by the Council, either word for word or in substance, and the Commission is of the opinion that several of the additional proposals now being put forward by the committee could also help to make the proposal even clearer and more concise. This applies, for example, to Amendment No 1, which concerns the definition of natural events. Seismic activities should continue to be included in the definition, but geothermal events should be added, and the rest of the amendment will clarify the text. We are also able to support Amendments Nos 3 and 4. They clarify the public information requirements, which as we all know are a very important aspect of the proposal. We are also able to support the demand that the question of alert thresholds for particulates should be reviewed in 2003, and so we accept Amendment No 5 and also Amendment No 8, which corrects a mistake concerning the margin of tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are some other amendments which Mrs Pollack has already mentioned. Amendment No 2 would require all Member States to report cases where the WHO's guideline ten‐minute concentration for sulphur dioxide has been exceeded. We in the Commission want to see as much information as possible about this guideline value, but it would be too difficult for a number of Member States to comply with this, and therefore we cannot support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are Amendments Nos 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11. In one sense, I might be pleased with the amendments, because they propose that we return to some of the limit values originally proposed, or that we tighten them further, and I can only be pleased that Parliament agrees with the Commission's original proposal. The fact that I nonetheless do not support them has to do with the debate which took place in the Council, because it appears that it would be too demanding for several Member States to comply with the limit values which are set out in the common position, especially those for particulates. It would require decisions which are too difficult. The Commission's aim is, of course, to ensure the highest possible standards of protection which can be achieved in the Union. The situation with regard to this proposal is that Member States which are in a position to go further may do so in connection with this proposal, because it is in keeping with the framework directive on air quality for them to go further if they can. But as I have said, in view of the conditions in the Union as a whole, I dare not – if I may put it that way – accept these amendments, for fear that we would not then be able to push through the proposal as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is the first concrete implementation of the EU's new programme for the improvement of air quality for its citizens and for the environment. The Commission believes that the proposal, as it now stands, will still provide a high level of protection, and that it is therefore a strong basis for the programme. We recently adopted another proposal on carbon monoxide and benzene. We shall also return to the pollutants dealt with in this proposal in 2003, to see whether even more can be done in the next phase. I therefore put my trust in the fact that, as time goes on, the impact of the programme will gradually increase. And I also hope that we can all look forward to the cleaner air, better health and improved environment which this proposal will bring about.</p>

<p class="contents">I should simply like to congratulate the Commissioner and thank her for coming tonight, given her recent accident and the lateness of the hour, and also to ask her to extend my thanks as rapporteur to the staff in DG XI who have been particularly helpful on this very technical directive.</p>
