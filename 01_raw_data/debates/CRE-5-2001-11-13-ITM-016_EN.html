<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, even at this unreasonably late hour, I am honoured to submit for your consideration the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on insurance mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it is a good proposal, on which the Commission should be congratulated. Above all, it is a proposal that manages to find a balance between the various interests concerned. In the area that it is intended to regulate, these interests include those of intermediaries, of insurance companies, and also, and this must not be forgotten, the interests of consumers, although these usually put less pressure on Members than the aforementioned interested parties. All of these interests should be taken into account, and when I say that this proposal is a balanced one, I am referring to the fact that there is a balance between all of the various interests concerned. Not to mention that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs must aim to uphold this balance that the Commission has scrupulously maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other interests which are, in my opinion, less worthy of consideration. I am talking about sectors whose main aim is to uphold the status they currently enjoy in their respective countries, which will be impossible to sustain when we attempt to produce a harmonisation standard. If the aim of each country, or of each sector in each country, is that the forthcoming directive should not in any way affect the status quo, the only possible solution will, therefore, be not to have a harmonisation standard, or if it is required in an area such as this, that there should be no internal market in the specific sector in question.</p>
<p class="contents">This aspiration can disguise an attempt for the harmonisation standard to respond exclusively to the current model in a specific country; or, put in more favourable terms, to suggest that Member States should not apply important parts of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, do you not think that these exceptions could render the harmonisation standard meaningless? Do you not realise that taking this route will cause problems for the internal market? The proposal for a directive included certain exceptions, and it is true that the report enlarges on some of these, but I think that these exceptions are within the bounds of what is reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that those who sell insurance on behalf of travel agencies or veterinary surgeons have to be registered intermediaries should be excluded, for this falls within what is reasonable. Even now, I firmly believe that the further extension of exceptions could end up in nullifying the effect of the directive or, to put it differently, could end up by limiting, to a certain extent, the creation of an internal market in insurance mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">I still insist, and please forgive me for doing so in this way, that the resultant report includes several special features that certain countries have to ease the adoption of the directive. For example, amendments relating to the tied agent that were designed to find a solution to ease the adaptation of legislation in those countries in which there is currently no regulation in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, evidently, other formulas, and one of these was the one set out in the Commission proposal, and another that consists of my personal viewpoint stated in my original report. However, neither the original formula nor my original proposal would be completely satisfactory to a good number of my fellow Members, who hold different positions, which is why compromise amendments had to be tabled that, I think, should resolve the problem reasonably clearly. I would like you to be aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the result that is being submitted for your consideration is the outcome of a compromise between different points of view that, when seen as a whole, are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only for this reason and out of respect for this compromise that the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided not to table any more amendments, with the exception of three that are simply of a technical nature, that aim to correct inconsistencies in the text. Clear proof of this fact is the refusal to table any amendments such as those tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that were subsequently defeated at committee stage and with which I personally agreed, because these are not only in line with the main points of my original proposal, but they also seek to provide better consumer protection, something with which I will always agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how sensitive insurance mediation is, and our directive concerns precisely the mediation aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we found the Commission’s proposal both balanced and interesting, although possibly a little overcomplicated, which is why we have endeavoured to streamline it with a series of amendments – I am, of course speaking on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has drafted its opinion – to make the sector which does not focus primarily on insurance rather more mobile and marketable. There are, in fact, many entities, such as travel and tour agencies, whose main activity is not insurance but which do sell risk and life insurance as part of their business. Such transactions clearly lie<span class="bold"> </span>outside and are not bound by the usual conventions of professionalism and honour, by the extremely stringent and far-reaching requirements, that is, which guarantee precisely that good faith and reliability and credibility that should be high priority in insurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that the insurance business is based on trust. Trust has a dual basis: trust in the product on the one hand, and on the other, trust in the other party's sales personnel and in their way of doing business. It needs, then, to be said today that the absolute majority of all sales personnel and brokers do their work in a proper way; otherwise the insurance business would not be flourishing and justifying the trust placed in it by its customers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, many States' laws on insurance and banking already impose strict duties of consultation and information, which are binding also on brokers. Insurers and credit institutions are subject to supervision and obligatory registration and to clear regulations on policy. Quite independently of that, I share the directive's desire to guarantee the creation of a high professional standard for insurance brokers, to establish a single register for cross-frontier operations and to secure a high level of protection for insurance enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above what has already been said, Mr Radwan and I have tabled three amendments – Nos 57, 58, and 59 – in which we intend, firstly, to have it left to the Member States to decide whether to exempt insurance brokers dealing in commercial risks from the requirements of the directive; secondly, to have the intermediary activity end with the conclusion of the contract, as is customary; and thirdly, to make a clearer distinction between those who work as insurance brokers as their main occupation and those for whom this activity is incidental to another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This involves minimal harmonisation, the setting of professional standards and consumer safeguards as well as mutual recognition between Member States, to enable brokers to enjoy freedom of establishment throughout the Union with rules to ensure prudential care for the good conduct of their business.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on his largely cooperative cross-party approach in committee, appropriate to a technical report which provides quality assurance to the consumer. It is worth noting that approximately 95% of European consumers use the services of insurance brokers and will be affected by this directive, along with 100 000 insurance practitioners in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The vast majority of areas of political difference were resolved in a series of compromise amendments, as well as those requirements due to the peculiar structure of the German industry. I was delighted at the adoption of a large number of my own amendments, ranging from exemptions for the travel industry, to recognition of the role of the computer and the Internet and the future role of e-commerce for insurance, as well as safeguards for a three-yearly review of eligibility for registration, and protection for businesses located offshore outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope this report will not increase the burden to intermediaries, in terms of cost or difficulty, or of conducting normal business practices, but will open up a competitive and transparent market throughout the 15 Union Member States, which ultimately, by providing volume and economy of scale, will provide real savings which will be handed down to the citizens of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer, and also Mr Ferri, for the quality of their work which has resulted in the recommendation submitted to this plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive on insurance mediation, scheduled in the action plan for financial services, is a key text to achieve a true internal market in insurance, in particular as regards retail markets. Insurance intermediaries play a fundamental role in the sale of insurance in the Community and their importance would increase with the emergence of more complex and sophisticated insurance products.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the internal market in insurance has been completed as regards insurance undertakings, especially concerning the prudential rules, insurance intermediaries continue to be confronted with several obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty. The proper functioning of the internal market is therefore hindered.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that Parliament agrees with the essential objectives of the Commission's proposals. It seeks to ensure that insurance intermediaries possess a high level of professional competence and that an intermediary, duly registered in his home Member State, may conduct his activities throughout the internal market. The proposal also aims to guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the amendments submitted to the plenary session. The Commission can accept the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 28, 30, 37 and the second part of No 58. It can also accept either partially or in their spirit the following amendments: 3, 7, 11, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 32, 44 and 51. Amendment Nos 15 and 16 may also be accepted in part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the other amendments tabled for the following reasons. Amendment Nos 2, 10, 13, 14, 46, 47, 49, 52 and 57 aim to exclude from the scope of the proposal some activities such as those of travel agencies, veterinarians and persons acting on an occasional basis, and therefore these amendments cannot be accepted. These exclusions would affect the sale of insurance products involving important risks and are therefore rejected. The same reasons explain the non-acceptance of Amendment Nos 12 and 50.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the term "insurance intermediary" is defined in an appropriate manner. The scope of the directive is well balanced. Amendment Nos 15 and 16 are therefore not necessary since the definition covers all intermediation activities, including those carried out by electronic means. The same applies to Amendment Nos 19 and 25 which relate to sub-agents and also to Amendment Nos 20 and 58.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of "bancassurance", all forms of "bancassurance" activities should fall within the scope of the proposal. It is an increasingly important way of distributing insurance. Amendment Nos 18 and 22 propose a definition of "bancassurance" activities which only takes account of one of the possible forms that "bancassurance" may take. They are therefore rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">There are amendments relating to registration and professional requirements of insurance intermediaries. Amendment Nos 31 and 56 would imply less strict rules to cover professional negligence of insurance intermediaries. They would jeopardise the objective of ensuring an appropriate level of professional liability cover for insurance intermediaries in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 33, 34 and 54 would affect the overall coherence of the proposal which is based on the principle of home country control. Amendment No 35 and 36 concern complaint schemes and out-of-court redress mechanisms of the proposal. Amendment No 35 is already implicit in the text of the proposal and is not necessary. Amendment No 36 does not seem appropriate in the context of a directive since it contains a specific reference to a Commission recommendation which is not legally binding on the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly there are amendments referring to information requirements. A key element of the Commission proposal is to ensure a high level of protection of consumers through the provision of appropriate information and advice. Amendment Nos 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 55, 60 and 61 would compromise considerably this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment Nos 6, 45 and 48 which provide that non-registered persons excluded from the scope of the directive should comply with information requirements, would be extremely difficult for the Member States to implement in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to have talked so long about these amendments, but Parliament has a right to know what the Commission thinks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
