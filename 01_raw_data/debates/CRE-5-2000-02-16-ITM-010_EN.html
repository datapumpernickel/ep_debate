At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field. It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards. There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports. These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection. This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation. If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira – because they move in that direction – and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the story of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> seems comical. A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think. The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.</p>

<p class="contents">However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework. That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously. In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation. In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field. The Commission’s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive. The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible. We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community. As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification. Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999. I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation. The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health. This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community’s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO’s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment. So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that. I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period “before” and “after” NATO’s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within. We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community. The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation. The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo’s administration. This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole. And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner’s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration. I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved. The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources – and this is connected with the Member States’ contributions – to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I am aware that there may be different views about NATO’s action and the legitimacy of that action. Everyone is free to hold such views. In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter. That was how it was.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Council’s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime. This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April. I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land. I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada. This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted. In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO’s actions in the Kosovo conflict. All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO’s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor. Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action. Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure. As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago. We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety. This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo. Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments. Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like. We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner’s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover. This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt. Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine. We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic’s forces in Kosovo. So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks. This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible. And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community. Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight – and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself – I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that underlying this question is the key issue of Nagorno-Karabakh and also Armenia’s conflict with Azerbaijan, which have repercussions here of course, given the special relationship that Azerbaijan has with Turkey. Nevertheless, as regards the relationship that interests us – the relationship between the European Union and Armenia – the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in July 1999 and the first meeting that we held in October last year show how seriously the European Union takes its relations with Armenia. One of our aims is to extend commercial relations in the area of trade and investment in particular. Another aim is to maintain a bilateral political dialogue with Armenia, in view of its major role in that subregion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As I said, Nagorno-Karabakh is an issue which it is still vital to resolve and one which of course threatens the stability of the southern Caucasus. In our view, all efforts to achieve a solution to this conflict must be intensified. This must be our top priority. The European Union has been endeavouring to facilitate this process and we are of course also aware that Turkey must adopt a constructive attitude towards this matter and play a major role in it. In December 1999, as we all know, Turkey was accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union. Political dialogue with Turkey will be stepped up in view of this new situation. The presidency of the European Union, which I myself represented, visited Ankara immediately after that decision and we stressed to the Turkish authorities the importance of strengthening political dialogue between us. In particular, we stressed the need for us to take advantage of Turkey’s own importance in the region, particularly in relation to central Asia and the Caucasus. We will try to reach common positions on international issues in the context of this relationship with Turkey, one which we would like to see become ever closer politically speaking. As I have said, this applies in particular in view of the region of which Turkey forms a part, and given the importance of its strategic geographical position. We hope that Turkey will adopt a constructive and positive attitude. Above all, we hope that, in the political dialogue preceding the whole run-up to negotiations, Turkey will be able to accept the European Union’s statements on common foreign and security policy. In this case, I feel that Turkey will not be able to avoid our interpretation of the need to find reasonable solutions to the Nagorno-Karabakh situation, respecting the legitimate aspects of both Armenia and Azerbaijan’s positions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union’s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey’s will as regards the European Union’s priorities in its foreign relations. Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations. We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union’s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Worsening situation in Kosovo</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Kosovo, the genocide of Serbs and other non-Albanian ethnic groups is continuing and worsening to the extent that Mr Bernard Kouchner himself recently announced that the political situation and the level of security in the area were far from satisfactory. Accusations are also being made of failure to implement UN Directive 1244 since, on the one hand, its provisions concerning guarantees for all the inhabitants of Kosovo are being disregarded and on the other, encouragement is being given to extremist breakaway groups, culminating in the appointment of the former KLA leader H. Thaci as 'interim prime minister' of Kosovo and the designation of the KLA as the 'Kosovo protection force'.</p>

<p class="contents">Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.</p>

That Council emphasised its support for the efforts of UNMIK and of Bernard Kouchner, the special representative of the Secretary-General, and in particular their efforts to create an interim administrative structure, in Kosovo, under which the guarantee that it will include all sides, particularly those which have until now refused to take part in this interim structure, will not be an empty one.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Javier Solana, the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy of the European Union, gave this General Affairs Council an assessment of the situation. He is expected to put forward proposals on this matter, particularly internal adjustment measures, which will allow, not only a certain degree of flexibility in inter-ethnic relations, but will also – as I have already stated in response to another question – permit the establishment of new police structures and the creation of systems which will enable the Kosovo situation to be prevented from becoming considerably worse, in terms of corruption, drug-trafficking and crime. The forces on the ground have so far been unable to solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore obvious, Mr Korakas, that the Council of Ministers is still seriously concerned about the current situation in Kosovo, particularly about the exodus of the Serbian population and of other ethnic and religious minorities from Kosovo. These minorities are often not mentioned enough when discrimination taking place in Kosovo is discussed. The Council wishes to express its consternation and concern at the degree of inter-ethnic violence still being seen.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said in response to another question, the latest outbreak of hostilities in Mitrovica is just another example of the difficulty of overcoming the distrust which has built up over decades. Obviously we are at just one stage of a process which has already passed through various earlier stages, and I think that we should always see this stage in the light of history.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers of the European Union has on several occasions stated its commitment to establishing a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo in accordance with the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. It has in particular declared its commitment to all refugees being able to return safely and without obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear, Mr Korakas, regardless of the many doubts that we may have concerning Resolution 1244, that it is still the main determinant of our actions in that region. As regards criticisms levelled at the Council, I wish to state that the Council condemns all acts of violence, persecution and intolerance, whoever commits them.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in response to the current situation, the Council has resolutely supported the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, has contributed to its budget and has taken responsibility for the so-called “fourth UNMIK pillar”, which is concerned with economic reconstruction and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In assessing the progress that UNMIK has made so far, we must bear in mind the extremely difficult circumstances in which this organisation is operating. By this I mean the large number of refugees and displaced persons who have had to be rehoused, the fact that most of the infrastructure has been destroyed, the strength of feeling that still exists in every section of Kosovo’s population, the fact that the economy has collapsed and the total lack of internal tax income. There is also the fact that administrative structures at local and district level have imploded, as have the judicial and police systems. This is all due to the war and to a decade of neglect after Belgrade removed Kosovo’s autonomy. This factor is important and it should remain clear in everyone’s mind that it was the change in Kosovo’s status within the Republic of Yugoslavia that caused the increasing ethnic tensions that gave rise to the current situation. This factor must not be forgotten, lest the past actions of those who are historically responsible should also be forgotten. </p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, I think that UNMIK, together with the other international bodies and organisations involved, must have made some progress in relation to some of the objectives stated in Resolution 1244, although we are still a long way from a situation which is at all satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Council also supports the decision of the special representative, Bernard Kouchner, to establish a provisional joint administrative council which should include all of Kosovo’s ethnic groups, as I have already mentioned. The European Union has appealed to the Serbs in Kosovo to reconsider their boycott of this structure so that they can contribute to a multi-ethnic region and assure themselves a place in the new administrative structures.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the European Union is also supporting UNMIK’s efforts to construct the Kosovar civil police force, with the aim of helping to combat multi-ethnic violence and of creating the secure atmosphere necessary to prevent Kosovars of non-Albanian ethnic origin from leaving the province. Although we have already made a substantial contribution, we must recognise that, until now, as I have already said, the EU Member States have not been able to detach officers to this police force, which has proven to be a very damaging factor for the operation of a public security structure.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, in accordance with the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 24 January, the Member States are doing their utmost to find additional police personnel, and the most recent General Affairs Council reiterated this position. Strengthening police forces is also an important task in the context of the growing threat represented by organised crime, and the Commission is seeking to include the fight against organised crime in its programme of assistance for Kosovo for 2000 and is asking the Member States to identify what assistance they can provide in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that a large part of the solution to the Kosovo problem – and there cannot be very much doubt about this – also relates to the problem of stabilising the countries involved. Unless this is done, there is no point in thinking that we can solve Kosovo’s problems. We therefore need to stabilise the situation in Albania, and there are currently proposals for the Commission to evaluate Albania’s chances of moving towards a stabilisation and association agreement. We need to stabilise the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and we need to come up with integrated models in the other areas of the former Yugoslavia. Unless we can do all this, we will not be able to find separate solutions for Kosovo. It is the overall context in the region and the overall context for implementing the Stability Pact that provide a solution for this situation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that, as they say in my country, in the home of a hanged man one does not mention ropes. Yugoslavia used to be a peaceful country, a paragon of stability and peace. It was NATO’s interventions and initially those of Germany which led to all that has happened. So it is not the Belgrade Government that is responsible, but NATO itself, the imperialists and their interventions. What do we have today? We have a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution 1244 and this proves that it was a trap. We have 350 000 Serbians, Gypsies and other nationalities, besides Albanian Kosovars, who have been expelled. Nine-hundred were murdered, 800 abducted, and 8 months later we have a continuing and flagrant violation of the Security Council’s resolution. For example, not only has the KLA failed to disarm, as provided for in the resolution, but on the contrary, by virtue of Mr Kouchner’s assertions in the European Parliament, it has acquired modern equipment and has now been designated the “Kosovo Protection Force”. In conclusion, since the Minister mentioned Mr Kouchner, I would like to say that, with his 25 decrees, Kouchner is violating both the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and the Security Council’s resolution. He has created a separate currency, a judicial body...</p>

The first of these which I wish to draw to the House’s attention is the idea that Belgrade is not responsible for the situation in Kosovo. I wish to make this clear because it is an important statement and it implies that imperialist action by NATO is responsible for the situation in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an odd interpretation – although it is perhaps not quite so odd, as it is shared by the Serbian authorities – but I think that you must understand, Mr Korakas, that there are other interpretations too. You must also understand that the international community and the EU Council of Ministers have a view of events which is very different to your own.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Resolution 1244, if it is a trap, then I do not understand either why it is that you think that every violation of this trap is considered to be damaging. Resolution 1244 may not be perfect, but it was the only resolution that could be agreed upon to bring an end to a particular situation. This resolution has probably been difficult to apply for the simple reason that it presupposes a climate of stability, to which neither Mr Milosevic nor his regime have contributed.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise, as we all do, that the behaviour of certain Kosovar Albanian forces in Kosovo has been neither desirable nor successful. Mr Kouchner has been highly critical of this situation and this behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not imagine, Mr Korakas, that all the blame can be placed on one side. Nor should we imagine that we can forget the past when we are analysing the present. The present, particularly in the case of the Balkans, and you know this better than I do, has its roots in history and in successive historical developments. There are not only “good guys” in this story. As I see it, these situations are quite clear and we should all learn lessons from and accept responsibility for our previous inaction in the face of Mr Milosevic’s behaviour, at a time when he could do whatever he wanted in Kosovo with impunity, particularly once he had taken away its autonomy.</p>

Neither you nor I will ever know what might be happening now in Kosovo or what might have happened in Kosovo if NATO had not dropped its bombs. We will never know if the aggressive and ever worsening actions Mr Milosevic and his government were perpetrating more and more frequently would in fact have had far more dire consequences than those that we are witnessing in Kosovo today.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to lifting sanctions, we think that the European Union’s attitude towards Yugoslavia has amounted to a careful assessment of the various situations. We have implemented an Energy for Democracy programme to support democratically governed municipalities in Yugoslavia. We reacted positively, at last Monday’s General Affairs Council, to the request made to us by democratic forces in Serbia that we should lift the air embargo, both for international aircraft and for aircraft belonging to Yugoslavia’s national airline. These are signs of the European Union’s goodwill towards the situation in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise that we will not achieve results by making gestures that are not reciprocated. Nor will we achieve results by providing certain kinds of facilities for the Serbian authorities, whose actions, particularly in the sphere of human rights within Serbia, and particularly as regards Serbia’s internal political system, are still deeply regrettable. I hope that you will agree with me, Mr Marset Campos, about the current state of democracy in that country. We shall make appropriate gestures towards Serbia, in terms of providing services, of lifting sanctions, when Serbia’s behaviour, both on the international stage and in its relations with its neighbouring countries, and its behaviour within its own borders, is in tune with what we consider to be the fundamental principles governing the international community and the behaviour of “decent” countries on the world stage.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself. Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part. Yugoslavia’s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union. So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN’s Resolution 1244.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development. Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people’s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative. The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way. We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not defend attacks on civilians. What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action. What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area. As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions. We are making an overall value judgement about NATO’s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO’s action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition’s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights. In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation. This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia’s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the charter stems from a decision of the Cologne European Council. It is a factor that we feel is crucial to the construction of what could be called an ethical pillar for the European Union and of what could be called the European Union’s need, in aiming to achieve a Union of values, to be able to increase its scope, not just internally, but also in order to give legitimacy to its own image externally, based on a common set of values. This is of course extremely important for the Community of Fifteen. Four or five months ago, we probably did not think this was so important for the Community of Fifteen. Today, we are perhaps already thinking along different lines, or at least some of us are. The enlarged Union is also very important, specifically with regard to future cultural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of the charter is, as you know, currently under discussion. There have only been two meetings of the preparatory group for the Charter of Fundamental Rights; this group is now called the Convention for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are various problems that must be addressed in this area. First of all, we must decide if it is a declaratory text or a binding text. Secondly, there is the content of the charter. This applies whether the document is binding or not. In other words, we must decide whether it is a collection of all the principles which the Member States advocate and have enshrined in their national constitutions, or whether it is a new corpus which could to a certain extent act as a common pattern for the European Union. Then there is a fundamental problem which your question in fact touched upon and which I think is of the utmost importance, yet it has still not been resolved. That issue is whether this charter only applies to citizens of the Union or whether it also applies to third-country nationals who are resident in the Union. This issue is also under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is also an extremely important issue, that of the subordination of legal systems, and compatibility between the legal system of the Strasbourg Court and the legal system of the Luxembourg Court. This problem must be resolved when the Charter of Fundamental Rights is drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">You also touched upon the issue of social rights, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. We will have to find some common ground on this matter. I would like to say, as a member of the Portuguese delegation, that we regard economic and social rights as a vital part of the European Union’s heritage, and understand that they must be part of any European Union charter and of any corpus of European Union values. I do not know whether everyone shares this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning your last question, there is the issue of equality between men and women in the European Union. I am sure that this aspect will certainly be treated with the utmost care in this charter, all the more so because, during discussions on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we ourselves had strong views on this and the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam represented a qualitative leap as compared with Maastricht. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of incorporating the charter into the Treaty on European Union, I am currently chairing the steering group of the preparatory group for the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency is keen to ensure that, as soon as there is consensus on the charter among the people drafting it, it should be incorporated into the Treaty on European Union and that this issue should immediately be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, the charter does not fall within the competence of the Council, but comes under a convention with an elected chairman and representatives of the European Parliament, of national parliaments and of the governments of the Member States, and of the European Commission. It should be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference as soon as it is ready, but we are not in control of this procedure. We are merely monitoring the progress of the charter by means of a vice-chairman of the convention, who is at the same time the representative of the European Union presidency in this group.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue. I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not. I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union’s aims.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey. The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage. What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?</p>

Firstly, concerning the system of export credits in general, and, secondly, concerning the project you have mentioned in particular.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the general point, it should be pointed out that the G8 did not call on the OECD to establish common standards for the granting of export credits, as your question suggests. These standards already exist today. The agreement on guidelines for export credit which enjoy official support have been in force within the OECD since 1978. The objective of these guidelines is precisely to see that officially backed export credits are used properly, that is in a transparent and disciplined way. As you know, most OECD countries are already party to this agreement and the European Community as such, and not the Member States individually, is also party to this agreement, in accordance with Article 133, formerly Article 113 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement has been gradually corrected and improved and the European Union wishes to maintain its pivotal role in this process because it considers this to be of central importance in its international economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the G8, and in accordance with paragraph 32 of the Cologne Summit statement of June 1999, it is stated that we will work with the OECD towards common environmental guidelines for institutions that promote export. We aim to conclude this work by the time the G8 Summit is held in 2001. The G8 therefore recognise the importance of credits both for exports and for the environment, and the importance of the work currently being done within the OECD on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the OECD Ministerial Council meeting, in which I took part, welcomed the progress made in drawing up an OECD agreement on the exchange of environmental information on large projects involving officially backed export credits. The Council urged that work should continue, with the aim of strengthening common platforms, pending a report on progress to be made to the next session of the Ministerial Council to be held this year. As you know, the Member States of the European Union are playing a central role in this process and in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific point of the Ilisu dam itself, discussions are taking place between the Turkish authorities and authorities whose export credit agencies are potential suppliers of export credit insurance for those undertaking the project, who took a deliberate decision to make adequate safeguards for the environmental, social and cultural implications of this project. Furthermore, it was in this context that a representative of the United Kingdom stated in 1999 that he envisaged guaranteeing that export credit insurance would take second place to safeguarding the type of issue that you mentioned in your question, Mrs Lucas.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The question of an export credit licence does not apply to this project. It is worth pointing out that, as funding for the project has not been requested from the World Bank, there is no question of the Bank refusing to finance it. It could only refuse of course if such a request had been made. It goes without saying that the involvement of the Member States’ governments and official export credit agencies in the Ilisu dam project has been in compliance with European Union, OECD and G8 political and legal requirements and commitments, in the case of the G8 by those countries belonging to that group.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project. Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.

In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management. This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248. </p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role. With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court’s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union’s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits. In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament. The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter. It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council. I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions. These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way. This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations. As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter. What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians. My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one’s family lives and in which one benefits from public services. I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do. Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians? That is my first question. </p>
<p class="contents">My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue’s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
