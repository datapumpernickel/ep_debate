<p>(DE)This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and by which neither the Council nor the Member States are bound, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the January 2006 plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will be aware, the EU, on 25 April 2005, signed the accession treaty with Bulgaria on the basis of that country’s ongoing compliance with the Copenhagen accession criteria, especially with the political criteria requiring observance of human rights and of the principle of the rule of law. Bulgaria is, nevertheless, enjoined not only to maintain the standard it has reached to date, but also to make further improvements, and, as the Commission observed in its comprehensive monitoring report in 2005, there is still room for them in certain areas. The point therefore needs to be made that the EU will continue to give close attention to the progress Bulgaria makes in the full transposition of the acquis communautaire right up to the date of accession.</p>
<p>While the Council is familiar with the specific case to which the honourable Member has referred, it must, at present, await a precise and comprehensive investigation of the circumstances. It should be noted at the outset that the EU, generally speaking, expects Bulgaria to continue to transpose and apply the acquis and also to discharge its international obligations, notably those required by the Council of Europe and by the European Convention on Human Rights. All cases in which the police are suspected of abusing their powers or of mistreating persons in custody must be investigated thoroughly and without delay, and, where proven, the competent authorities must punish them severely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1143"></a>

<p>Over the last few days, a wave of food scandals has come to light in certain EU Member States.

<p>(DE)This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and by which neither the Council nor the Member States are bound, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the January 2006 plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>I would like to start by thanking Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her extremely relevant question. The end of the last decade saw the EU’s systems for ensuring the safety of food put under unprecedented pressure on account of crises in feedingstuffs and food. The weaknesses that came to light during these crises necessitated immediate action on the part of the competent bodies – notably the Commission, the Member States and Parliament – in order to reinforce, improve and further develop the existing systems. One important step was the establishment by Parliament and the Council in 2002 of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which, by acting as an independent source of advice on food safety issues, helps bring about a high standard of consumer protection in this area. For the sake of its own greater effectiveness, the EFSA works closely with the national scientific agencies and institutions dealing with food safety. The Council and the Member States also actively support it by ensuring that it is adequately funded and staffed and by taking full account of its findings.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the 2002 regulation of Parliament and Council that established the Authority also set up what is termed an Advisory Forum to support it. The Forum is composed of representatives of competent institutions in the Member States performing similar functions to those of the Authority.</p>
<p>This Advisory Forum meets between three and four times a year and facilitates both the exchange of information on potential risks associated with food and the amassing of the most up-to-date knowledge relating to it.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, the Commission will continue to keep Parliament and the Council informed of the results of the ongoing independent assessment of the authority’s performance since its establishment and will make any necessary recommendations for the improvement of its working methods.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Presidency can confirm to the Honourable Member that progress was made under the UK Presidency with regard to the aim of bringing the Council closer to the citizen. In this connection, at its session of 21 December 2005, the Council adopted a number of conclusions on improving openness and transparency<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These conclusions make provision for current practice to be changed in a total of five areas:</p>
<p>All legislative proposals under the codecision procedure presented orally by the Commission in a Council session, and the ensuing debate on them, will be open to the public (point 1 of the Council conclusions).</p>
<p>Previously, the debates on the most important legislative proposals tabled by the Commission were only to a limited extent open to the public.</p>
<p>Final Council deliberations on legislative proposals under the codecision procedure, i.e. all debates that take place once the other institutions or bodies have submitted their opinions, will be open to the public (point 2 of the Council conclusions).</p>
<p>In practice, this means that the number of public deliberations on such legislative proposals will increase by around 20 %.</p>
<p>When drawing up the agenda for each Council session, Coreper may consider making other deliberations on codecision items at the Council open to the public (point 3 of the Council conclusions).</p>
<p>This means that public deliberations on codecision items can be held not only at the initial and closing stages but also at the ‘interim’ stage.</p>
<p>The Council will in the future hold more debates in public on important new legislative proposals on items other than those covered by the codecision procedure (point 5 of the Council conclusions).</p>
<p>Under the Council’s current Rules of Procedure, the Council holds at least one public debate on legislative proposals other than those covered by the codecision procedure; in the future, this will be the case more often.</p>
<p>The Council may decide that its deliberations on non-legislative items be held in public if they involve important issues affecting the interests of the Union and its citizens (point 6 of the Council conclusions).</p>
<p>Article 8(3) of the Council’s Rules of Procedure already provides for ‘other public debates […] to be held on important issues affecting the interests of the Union’. In the light of the conclusions, more frequent used should be made of this possibility in future</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)As the Commission informed the Honourable Member in its last reply on this subject in October 2005, the Commission services addressed a letter to the Belgian authorities on August 10, 2005. The answer of the Belgian authorities containing various documents on the system of training grants in Wallonia was received by the Commission's services on November 18, 2005.</p>
<p>Having analysed this reply, the Commission's services consider that the arguments brought forward by the Belgian authorities are not convincing. In particular, the Commission services do not share the justifications for the obligation to be established in Wallonia in order to be accepted as a company allowed to provide training to employees benefiting from the special grants accorded by Wallonia. Such a restrictive measure, discriminating in particular against undertakings from other Member States, without being justified, could be contrary to article 49 of the Treaty on the free movement of services.</p>

<p>(EN)The reasons for the "no" votes in the French and Dutch referenda on the European Constitution are complex and varied. However, an undeniable common factor was poor EU economic performance and concerns about high unemployment. It is therefore clear that in order to restore citizens' faith in the EU there is a need to achieve better economic performance: higher employment and growth. The Internal Market, including the services sector, which constitutes almost 70% of Gross National Product (GNP) and jobs in the EU, is essential for economic growth and employment creation in Europe.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of the draft Directive on Services in the Internal Market<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in January 2004, the Commission has been active in explaining the benefits that EU economy and employment draws from a properly functioning Internal Market and is contributing to a high level of growth and employment. It has also been active in disseminating factual information explaining the provisions of the draft Directive. This has taken the form of numerous contacts, presentations and discussions with all stakeholders, at political and technical level, all around Europe, as well as publication of a wide variety of documents all of which are publicly available on the Commission's website. Every effort will continue to be made to address questions and issues raised and to explain the advantages, for citizens and businesses, of a properly functioning Internal Market for services.</p>
<p>The Commission is also convinced that the working being carried out by the co-legislator in the Parliament and Council will help dissipate misunderstandings about the purpose of the Directive. The Commission has constantly held that it would make every effort to work with the Parliament and Council in order to reach a broad consensus on this Directive.</p>
<p>On a broader level, the Commission constantly seeks to improve the way in which it communicates with EU citizens. In October 2005, the Commission launched its “Plan D” - Democracy, Dialogue and Debate – which aims to inject more democracy into the Union, to stimulate a wide public debate and build a new consensus on the future direction of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The "speeches" the Honourable Member is referring to were made in the very specific context of the Swedish "Vaxholm" or "Laval" case. Both the Commission’s President and the Commissioner in charge of Internal Market and Services have made it very clear, including before this Assembly in October 2005, that the Commission does not intend to, and has never intended to, call into question the social model of any Member State or the way in which it organises labour relations. Member States do, however, have the obligation to fulfil their duties under the Treaty, particularly to ensure that our businesses and citizens benefit from the four freedoms and that their basic rights are being respected. The case has been referred by the Swedish Labour Court to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. This is now a matter for the European Court of Justice. The Commission does not believe that the respect of the four freedoms under the European Treaties is incompatible with the social models chosen by the Member States. The role of the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaty, is to ensure that both the social acquis and the Internal Market rules are respected and fully implemented in all Member States, without discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1111"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission shares concerns that climate change might contribute to exacerbate the risk of severe storms and other extreme weather events. The 2005 hurricane season set an unprecedented record for having the most named tropical cyclones in a single year in known history, many of which displayed unusual paths and location. Hurricane Vince for instance developed in the eastern Atlantic, tracked north-eastwards, it passed northwest of the Madeira Islands, and as it weakened, became the first known instance of a tropical cyclone making landfall in Spain as a tropical depression. The current evidence suggests that hurricanes might become more destructive as ocean surface temperatures rise. As such, the level of hurricane activity observed this year in the Atlantic is consistent with these scientific models. However, it should be emphasised that the uncertainty of the current hurricane destruction trends and of their potential relation to global warming is high due to the relatively short observation record and coarse climate models.</p>
<p>The Commission launched, in October 2005, the Second European Climate Change Programme (ECCP II), which addresses the need for adaptation strategies through the establishment of a specific Working Group. The general objective of the Working Group is to define the EU’s role in adaptation policies so as to integrate adaptation fully into relevant European policy areas and to identify good, cost-effective practice in the development of adaptation policy.</p>
<p>The Commission has also made proposals to strengthen the rapid response and preparedness capacity of the European Civil Protection Mechanism to provide assistance in case a disaster can not be avoided. These proposals are currently with the Council for consideration.</p>
<p>Within EU regional and agricultural policy and funding areas, there are opportunities for Member States to support actions designed to counter or mitigate the effects of extreme weather events. In cases of major disasters the EU Solidarity Fund may also grant financial assistance. The Community has been funding climate research in particular through the 5<span class="sup">th</span> and 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programmes (FP) and will continue to do so in the 7<span class="sup">th</span> FP. Within these research activities in particular the regional downscaling of climate models will be important in order to support designing and to devising adequate policy responses to climate impacts at the regional and local level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1114"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission’s Legislative and Work Programme 2006 contains a number of proposals that will have an impact on the protection and promotion of the freedom of citizens under each of the four strategic objectives adopted by the Commission at the start of its mandate (prosperity, solidarity, security, and the external dimension of the Union).</p>
<p>Proposals under the ‘security’ objective aim at enhanced cooperation to protect European citizens against different serious threats, including terrorism. At the same time, these initiatives are being proposed to uphold fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, the right to liberty and security, the freedom to circulate, or the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence. Other items proposed to support security focus on e.g. strengthening consumer protection or targeting sexual violence against children.</p>
<p>Under the other objectives, the Commission proposes measures to expand the freedom of movement of citizens, e.g. by getting their competences recognised throughout the EU, and measures to implement the rights of the child throughout the Union and beyond. Also, questions related to the right to vote in elections to the Parliament and the publication of election results will be assessed.</p>
<p>The Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2006 strikes an appropriate balance between promoting the freedom of citizens and protecting them from serious threats. In parallel to the proposal of new policy initiatives, the Commission puts high emphasis on evaluating the implementation and the results of policies.

<p>(EN)The prevention of and the fight against trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual and labour exploitation is continuously addressed by the Commission. Most recently, on 18<span class="sup">th</span> October 2005 the Commission has issued a Communication on “Fighting trafficking in human beings - an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan”<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In this context the Commission stressed that in order to effectively address trafficking in human beings an integrated approach is needed, having as its fundament the respect of human rights and taking into account its global nature. This approach calls for a coordinated policy response notably in the area of freedom, security and justice, external relations, development cooperation, employment, gender equality and non discrimination. It also aims to reinforce the broad public-private dialogue in this area.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Communication was an important contribution to the Action Plan on trafficking in human beings, which was adopted on 1<span class="sup">st</span> December 2005 by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. According to the Action Plan, EU institutions and Member States should promote, for example, gender specific prevention strategies as a key element to combat trafficking in women and girls. This includes implementing gender equality principles and eliminating the demand for all forms of exploitation, including sexual exploitation and domestic labour exploitation. Inter alia, campaign material aimed at reducing trafficking shall be developed in 2006. The Commission is committed to the quick implementation of the Action Plan, which shall be reviewed and updated, if necessary. Furthermore, the Commission is evaluating the implementation of existing EU legislation against human trafficking, notably the Council Framework Decision of 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. A report will be issued very soon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission does not promote a particular technology but supports in general the investigation and evaluation of new technologies as well as its practical and economical exploitation. This includes the examination of its advantages and disadvantages and its potential to increase European competitiveness, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>In the field of Justice, Liberty and Security, there was a consensus, in the immediate aftermath of 11 September 2001, that the use of biometric identifiers in databases and travel documents should be developed in order to enhance the level of security and fight terrorism more effectively. It should be underlined that the use of biometrics is becoming necessary in that field because querying such large scale databases using alphanumerical data only (such as name, date of birth, etc) is now showing its limits. Biometrics can help here in increasing the level of accuracy in identifying or verifying the identity of a person and thus increasing the efficiency of the corresponding data processing. Since then, important technical work on biometrics has been carried out, in particular in the framework of the security of travel documents, such as passports, and in the context of visa policy. As regards passports, the objective is to render the passport more secure by integrating two biometric identifiers: a digitized image of the face and the image of two fingerprints; the security of passports is important for reasons relating to border controls: on the one hand, bona fide citizens will pass through border controls more smoothly; on the other hand, those who use forged or fraudulent passports will have fewer chances of entering our territory. This is about two basic elements of our area of freedom and security.</p>
<p>In the context of visa policy it is a well-known fact that the Commission is currently developing a visa system, the VIS, designed to share visa data between Member States with a view to improving the Common Visa Policy.</p>
<p>Commission services have launched a call for tender for a Biometric Matching System (BMS) so that the VIS will be ready for biometric processing by the end of 2006, thereby allowing Member States to start integrating their national visa systems with a VIS that includes biometrics. The BMS will be the largest biometric system in the world, with around 70 million records.</p>
<p>It also has to be noted that the study of the advantages and disadvantages of the technology has been continuously explored within the Research Framework Programmes. In the current 6th Framework Programme (FP6), this activity was part of the Information Society Technology Programme (IST) under the heading of “Towards a global dependability and security framework” (see http://www.cordis.lu/ist/trust-security/projects.htm). The overall volume of funding for biometrics related projects was within FP6 about € 30 million. In addition, a biometrics webportal (http://www.europeanbiometrics.info/) has been developed which has been already operational for three months. It is also expected that research support for biometrics technologies will be continued in Framework Programme 7 for which the Specific Work programmes will be developed early summer 2006.</p>
<p>Research in the field of multimodal biometrics is also covered by the Preparatory Action for Security Research, more particularly in the 2006 call for proposals that will be launched early February 2006.</p>
<p>It should also be stressed, that the Commission is devoting particular attention to the protection of personal data. The Commission recalls that Directive 95/46/EC on data protection<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> applies to the processing of personal data –including biometric data.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The following programmes are relevant:</p>
<p>The Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP5)</p>
<p>This programme was active during the 4-year period 1998/2002; many of the projects are still ongoing and producing results now. The programme has as a main objective the promotion of clean and efficient energy technologies in the fields of renewable energy sources (RES), Energy efficiency and fossil fuels. As regards the RES it includes photovoltaics, solar thermal (both solar power and solar heat), wind, small hydro, marine/ocean, biomass and wastes and geothermal, and technologies supporting large scale introduction of RES, including projects on electricity grids, socio-economic research, etc.</p>
<p>The amount spent for RES was around € 425 Million.</p>
<p>The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6)</p>
<p>This programme is run over the 4-year period 2003/2006. The programme has as a main objective the promotion of clean and efficient energy technologies in the fields of RES and Energy Efficiency as explained for FP5.</p>
<p>The 4th call for proposals was launched recently.</p>
<p>Since the results of the last calls are still pending, the total final budget for RES is not yet known; but, considering what has been already allocated in the previous calls, the foreseen amount for RES will be around € 450 Million.</p>
<p>The ALTENER programme</p>
<p>This programme was active during the 4-year period 1998/2002; some of the projects are still ongoing. The programme had as only objective the promotion of RES mainly through the removal of non-technological barriers in the market. The ALTENER programme was included in a larger programme, the Energy Framework Programme (EFP). The EFP included also other programmes with the same objective as SAVE for Energy Efficiency, CARNOT for Clean Coal, SYNERGY for International cooperation and ETAP for Socioeconomic studies and analyses.</p>
<p>The ALTENER programme had a budget of € 78 Million (around 45% of the total budget for the EFP).</p>
<p>The Intelligent Energy Europe Programme (IEE)</p>
<p>This programme started in 2003 and will come to an end in 2006. The programme promotes Sustainable Energy mainly through the support to the implementation of legislation and the removal of non-technological barriers in the market. The programme has 4 fields of activity:</p>
<p>ALTENER (II) for the promotion of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), including photovoltaics, solar thermal (high and low temperature), wind, small hydro, marine, biomass and wastes and geothermal;</p>
<p>SAVE for the promotion of Energy Efficiency in buildings and in the tertiary and industry;</p>
<p>STEER for the promotion of the energy aspects of clean and efficient transport;</p>
<p>COOPENER for the promotion of international cooperation with developing countries.</p>
<p>The total budget for the IEE programme is € 250 Million. The foreseen amount for RES will be around € 110 Million. The IEE programme will continue after 2006 in the Competitiveness and Innovation programme (CIP)</p>
<p>The total approximate contribution for the development of RES of all above mentioned programmes will be in total M€ 1063. It has to be noted that the budget of FP6 has been calculated on the basis of RES projects. The budget in FP5 has been calculated on the basis of RES only funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1122"></a>

<p>(FR)On 20 October 2005 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Parliament and Council directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This proposal is an initial important stage in ensuring that supplementary pension schemes in an enlarged European Union contribute to the objectives laid down at EU level with a view to a smooth-functioning labour market and a high level of social protection for workers. It is also in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p>The proposal is designed to simultaneously reduce the obstacles to freedom of movement across Member States and to mobility within any Member State stemming from provisions contained in these supplementary pension schemes. These obstacles relate to: the conditions of acquisition of pension rights, the conditions of preservation of dormant pension rights and the transferability of acquired rights. The proposal also seeks to improve the information given to workers on how mobility may affect supplementary pension rights.</p>
<p>The proposal was forwarded to Parliament and the Council, as well as to the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Discussions in the Council's Working Party on Social Questions began at the end of October under the UK Presidency.</p>
<p>The adoption of the proposal will require unanimity within the Council and codecision with Parliament</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member mentioned in this respect also Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services<a href="#defann_18_4" name="refann_18_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and in particular the articles 1(3) and 3(1) hereof. However, this directive does not deal with social security issues.</p>
<p>As far as coordination of social security schemes is concerned, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that Community law – notably Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72<a href="#defann_18_5" name="refann_18_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> - protects the social security rights of migrant workers by coordinating the different national social security schemes of Member States. One of the main principles of this coordination is to determine the social security legislation which is applicable to a migrant worker. As a rule, such a worker is subject to the social security legislation of the Member State where he or she is employed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission would like to begin by pointing out that the creation of a fourth Brussels European School became inevitable as a result of the expected increase in pupils which will soon lead to a general overcrowding of the three existing schools. This academic year, so many children of staff of the European institutions were registered in the Brussels II (Woluwé) and Brussels III (Ixelles) schools that not all requests could be met for the schools initially chosen by the parents.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 25 and 26 October 2005, the Board of Governors of the European Schools adopted a list of criteria, on the one hand, for the choice of language sections to be placed in Brussels IV and, on the other, for the manner in which the establishment of the sections intended to make up the Laeken school will be carried out.</p>
<p>This decision of the Board of Governors<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> thereby establishes a framework for joint reflection by all of the interested parties with a view to a distribution of sections that should allow the fourth school to become operational in September 2009, when the sites planned in Laeken will be made available by the Belgian authorities. This reflection is taking place within a working group of the Secretariat-General of the European Schools known as ‘groupe de suivi Bruxelles IV’ in which parents associations, the Brussels European Schools, teachers and the Commission are represented.</p>
<p>It now falls to that group to prepare the dossier that will be submitted to the Board of Governors presenting it with various options conforming to the criteria set and proposing the manner of transition for each option.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the Secretary-General of the European Schools has presented to the Groupe de Suivi for discussion various possible alternatives involving different numbers of language sections being created in the future European School in Laeken.</p>
<p>The work of the Group is not yet complete. Its priority is to ensure that the proposals put forward conform fully to the criteria adopted by the Board of Governors.</p>
<p>The group also has the task of defining the manner of transition for each possible scenario that would reduce as far as possible any inconvenience resulting from any transfer of language sections for children currently being taught in one of the three existing European schools in Brussels and for their families.</p>
<p>Not until the work of this Group is complete will this dossier be included on the agenda of the Board of Governors. Nevertheless, the Commission feels that it is important not just that the options presented be accompanied by the best possible manner of transition, but also that the necessary decisions can be taken by the Board of Governors sufficiently quickly to allow the families to be informed as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)Commission job application forms include fields to be filled in by any person applying to take part in a competition/selection procedure, in particular their surname and forename name, address, place of residence, date and place of birth, nationality and gender. The sole purpose of these fields is to identify the person in question. They are not intended to create discrimination based on age, nationality or gender, nor do they have this effect.</p>
<p>A person's date of birth is an element of their identity and, as such, helps to identify them (should there be anybody else with the same name). In practice, database searches are made easier and the risk of error minimised by the use of such data.</p>
<p>The identity document of which applicants are required to provide a copy is considered as proof of their identity and nationality (EU-25 citizenship being a condition for admissibility to any competition/selection procedure).</p>
<p>There is no possibility of age discrimination occurring, given that any reference in the recruitment of staff to an age limit beyond which applications will not be accepted is prohibited. It is also prohibited, in staff recruitment procedures, not only to set an age limit beyond which applications will not be accepted but also, more generally, to use age in any way as a recruitment criterion.</p>
<p>However, the practice of checking an applicant's age is justified in so far as its purpose is objective and reasonable (in the light of the Staff Regulations and the duty to check that the person recruited is an adult and is under 65 years of age).</p>

<p>In this regard, the Commission notes that the SNCB aid was granted within the framework of an industrial and strategic restructuring plan intended to tackle the sources of the group’s viability problems; it has also noted that the group’s results have already noticeably improved between 2002 and 2004, with a return to operational profits.

<p>(EN)In November 2004 the Council adopted conclusions noting with great concern that the 17 October 2004 parliamentary elections and referendum in Belarus were not conducted in a free and fair manner and strongly condemned the attacks on peaceful demonstrators, individual opposition leaders and journalists that took place after 17 October.</p>
<p>The Council also decided to introduce a visa-ban against the officials directly responsible for the fraudulent elections and referendum and against those responsible for severe human rights violations in the repression of peaceful demonstrators.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate for the EU to negotiate with Belarus a general agreement on the facilitation of visa issuing procedures including a visa fee exemption.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that under the current Common Consular Instructions, in individual cases Member States’ diplomatic missions and consular posts can waive or reduce the fee in accordance with national law when this measure serves to protect cultural interests, in the field of foreign policy, development policy or other areas of vital public interest.</p>
<p>Regarding exchanges between Belarusian and Member States’ universities, the EC has been supporting Tempus joint European projects with Belarus since 1994. These projects also provide for support to students’ mobility. Up to € 1.9 million have been earmarked for Tempus programme with Belarus in 2005-2006 and the Commission intends to maintain a focus on exchanges between universities for professors and students in the next programming period.

It does not however fall to the Commission to issue an opinion or intervene in decision making within companies unless Community law is being violated.

<p>In 2005, the priority for National Europass Centres consisted in establishing the implementation structures and launching the initiative in their countries. Most National Europass Centres launched Europass through specific national conferences, often accompanied by regional seminars or workshops. Participation in such events showed a high level of interest from stakeholders. National Internet sites have already been opened by the majority of centres to complement the European portal.

<p>If any breach of international trade rules under WTO is brought to the attention of the Commission, it will act promptly. This concerns for example evidence of dumping.</p>
<p>However, at present, no tangible evidence of possible dumping has been made available to the Commission.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of measures to restrict the import or marketing of apples from Third countries, the Commission would like to draw your attention to the rules of International Trade and, in particular, the WTO provisions which need to be fully complied with by the EU. In this respect, to restrict imports to a limited period (i.e. after 1<span class="sup">st</span> June each year) would not be consistent with our international and WTO obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1166"></a>

Article 56a of the Directive requires that the name of the medical product be also expressed in Braille on the packaging. The marketing authorization holder has to ensure that the package information leaflet is made available upon request from patients' organizations in formats appropriate for the blind and partially-sighted.

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the problem referred to by the Honourable Member. It has received a number of complaints relating to the practices of the European City Guide, directly from businesses as well as through MEPs.</p>
<p>In general, practices such as those described in the Honourable Member's question amount to misleading advertising, which is addressed by Council Directive 84/450/EEC on misleading and comparative advertising. The Directive provides for the use of cessation orders or other legal proceedings to prohibit the continued use of misleading advertising.</p>
<p>It is for the competent law courts and/or public enforcement authorities of the Member States to decide in each individual case whether a commercial communication is to be considered misleading and to take appropriate enforcement actions against individuals or companies.</p>
<p>In the case of the European City Guide the Commission was informed that the Catalan authorities decided in 2003 to close down the company and to impose a fine on it. The European City Guide has appealed this decision and appears to have moved its activities from Barcelona to Valencia.</p>
<p>Although it cannot intervene in individual cases, the Commission will continue to monitor the activities of the national enforcement authorities. The Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection has personally written to his Spanish counterpart to draw her attention to this matter and inquire about any further actions the Spanish authorities have taken.</p>
<p>As regards the Honourable Member’s question on whether the Commission intends to propose new legislation or amend existing legislation, while the Commission is not ruling out this possibility in the future, it would first have to be established that there are loopholes or a lack of clarity in the Community legislation or that additional Community legislation is the most appropriate response. Currently, we have no evidence that the problems can be attributed to shortcomings of the legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1179"></a>

This data also shows that there has been a significant increase in the transfer of the virus by means of heterosexual contact, close to 25% compared with 2002, while the percentage of women infected is also on the rise. At the same time, according to the UN's Annual Report on AIDS for 2005, cases of the disease are also on the increase at world level, a trend attributable in large measure to a laxer attitude towards contraceptive measures and a consequent lowering of the level of vigilance.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for her question on the important issue of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Europe, and in particular on raising the awareness of Europeans’ on HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Tackling the HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> epidemic is our common task. Working together provides a real opportunity to pool expertise and knowledge to identify the best tools for prevention, support, treatment and care.</p>
<p>The immediate response of the Commission to the re-emergence of HIV in Europe was to mobilise the stakeholders and the Member States and to distil what needed to be done in the working paper ‘coordinated and integrated approach to combat HIV/AIDS within the EU and in its Neighbourhood’ in September 2004. You will find there a strong commitment for immediate actions.</p>
<p>These actions are now being implemented with partners in the Member States. Progress and next steps are contained in the Commission’s Communication ‘on combating HIV/AIDS within the EU and in the neighbouring countries’ that was adopted on 15 December 2005. The Communication builds on the priorities identified in the working paper and sets out the main lines for action until the end of 2009, focusing on the areas where strengthening the efforts is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member quite rightly points out the fact that it is crucial to strengthen all prevention activities; through education and awareness raising as well as through promoting the use of condoms and the implementation of harm reduction services for injecting drug users, such as the exchange of clean needles and syringes.</p>
<p>In this regard the Commission has started, together with Member States and partners like the World AIDS Campaign, European Broadcasting Union (EBU), MTV, and other supportive businesses, a long term initiative targeted at the general public with the main messages on stigma and discrimination.</p>
<p>The Commission has established structures to coordinate HIV/AIDS activities within its services in charge of relevant policy sectors and also with the Member States, neighbouring countries, international organisations, and civil society. The structure that coordinates all the external partners is the HIV/AIDS Think Tank.</p>
<p>The Think Tank has developed into a platform to exchange experience and information on various matters, including updated and/or new national HIV/AIDS plans. The Commission is now considering how to develop this further in order to facilitate the development of national plans in the Member States and in the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has made an attempt to help the Member States to increase the money available for health activities, like implementing the national HIV/AIDS action plan, by introducing health as one of the key funding areas of the European Regional Development Fund from 2007 on. However, now it is up to the Council and Parliament to seize this opportunity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
