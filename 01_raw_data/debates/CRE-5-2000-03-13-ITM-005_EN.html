We have been discussing the Erika disaster here for the past couple of weeks. A whole ream of new measures on double hulls, inspection, the inspection of inspectorates, etc are being conceived in the short term. Disasters of this kind account for no more than 3% of oil pollution at sea. Normal shipping operations account for double this amount. Not only that. If we consider our beaches, for example in the Netherlands – but also in other countries – 49% of the rubbish washed up on the shore comes directly from the sea. Only 15% is due to tourism and a large proportion is even unaccountable for, although that, of course, must originate from somewhere. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, this directive is essential because the economic damage is significant and because the quality of the habitats for birds, fish, etc., which is so vital, is deteriorating. In other words, this affects our own habitat. I do not need to say any more concerning the motives underlying this directive. I will only have positive things to say to the Commission about the quality of the directive. There was nonetheless a whole raft of amendments at first reading which has been completely endorsed by Parliament. I believe there were eighteen in total, a large proportion of which have been adopted, with a number of less important ones having been rejected. These will re-emerge in some shape or form. I would mainly like to home in on one very important point. </p>
<p class="contents">We all share the view throughout the Union that something needs to be done when the seas are polluted. I would once again refer to the Erika, but there are also other examples. We are also agreed that the polluter-pays principle must apply. </p>
<p class="contents">The present report contains an amendment which states that the full range of cost recovery systems should not be admitted within the European Union because some cost recovery systems for port reception facilities do not do justice to what is needed to keep our environment clean. There is no financial incentive. Let me illustrate this quite clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the southern Member States, to all intents and purposes, a direct costing principle applies, which means that the polluters who deliver their waste to port do pay whereas the polluters who do not deliver their waste to port, still pollute but do not pay. </p>
<p class="contents">Northern countries apply a system in which this financial element is handled in a different way. Everyone pays, whether they dump their waste in the sea or dispose of it elsewhere. In addition, there is some kind of financial incentive that contributes in some way or other to ensuring that this waste is disposed of. Experience and scientific research has shown that this seems to work. </p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the reasons why Parliament is tenacious on this point. The Commission, too, on whose behalf I am talking, persists in applying a percentage of indirect costs which must be included in the port dues. </p>
<p class="contents">This is, in fact, what we are opting for. If the percentage is 90%, so be it. It could also be 75%, but there should at least be a minimum level, which should be quite inflexible. Otherwise we will fall back into a variety of systems and it will be years – in a manner of speaking – before we learn from the lesson we have actually already been taught. I would therefore like to assure everyone that this is why it is sensible to opt for a system in which indirect costs are somehow absorbed in port dues. If you read the Commission’s proposal, a country could fall to 0.01% of indirect costs if it so wishes. I fear that this will be opted for in practice. This will also be the key point of discussion for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a whole raft of other factors involved and we have reached agreement on a great many of them. I do believe that somehow we will make it. But this is the crux of the matter and I wanted to draw everyone’s attention to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, very much for taking on this dossier and for elucidating it so well. We are after all at one with the Council on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, proper port reception facilities for ship-generated waste have to be constructed at every European port unless it already has them. They must therefore be provided. Secondly, all ships, regardless of the flag they fly, have to dispose of their waste. Thirdly, the costs must be borne by the ship. We agree on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, together we want to put a system in place so as to avoid there being financial incentives to dump waste into the sea. Firstly, we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly, there are a large number of coastlines along which, on the one hand, tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created. That means that we want to have an effective system.</p>
<p class="contents">So where do we differ from the Council, apart from on minor details such as the fact that we wish to exempt museum ships from the bureaucratic rules and that we are a little stricter where large fishing vessels and recreational craft are concerned? The really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship. Mr Bouwman has, of course, already explained this. There are two precedents. The first is in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not the experience of an individual state but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and it says that if a large proportion of the disposal costs is covered by the general port dues then there is obviously no incentive to dispose of the ship-generated waste at sea. Surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port.</p>
<p class="contents">The other system is the pure polluter-pays principle: anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for doing so. This second system has proved to be ineffective, otherwise why would the Mediterranean Sea be so dirty? Why would the North Sea be so dirty? Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work! That is why a broad majority of the committee – not a large majority; the representatives of the minority view will be speaking shortly – said, as Parliament as a whole did in the first reading, without any dispute, that the ‘no-special-fee’ system was the best system because it, as it were, offers ships a financial incentive not to dump their muck into the water when they are at sea but to dispose of it in proper port reception facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the decisive issue. We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council. But so far the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us. That is why I call on the House to support our amendment whereby a significant proportion – up to 90% – of the costs have to be covered by the general port dues. This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, whether it be on 75% or whatever. That is also why I would make the following request of the Commission: Madam Vice-President, think carefully about which side you stand on! I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system. For these reasons support our ‘no-special-fee’ system. Perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piecyk (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I am pleased that you are the one chairing this debate because I know that as a Bavarian you always offer a sympathetic ear where ports and maritime matters are concerned, and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for the work which he has done and also for cooperating with us in the run-up to tomorrow's vote. There are a few points at stake tomorrow. Firstly, we know that the ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport for carrying passengers and goods. At the same time we know that ships make a hefty contribution to polluting the sea with rubbish, cargo residues and oily slime. The fuel used by ships happens to be heavy oil and we know that this heavy oil leaves a residue of between 1% and 3% as oily slime, which is typically discharged into the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port. It follows – and in fact there is no other logical conclusion – that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas. This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here.</p>
<p class="contents">In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster. On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is, of course, also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner. Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port.</p>
<p class="contents">This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either. The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them. The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution, of at least 90%. And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which – as has already been explained here today – was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the ‘no-special-fee’ system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and – the decisive point – alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with ‘Erika’. Oil comes onto the beaches and then politicians and ministers appear and try to clear it up themselves with a tiny little bucket, but when a fortnight later a robust directive is up for debate they have forgotten yesterday's fine words. We will not be able to rule out accidents altogether, but we can take optimal precautions. This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that our liberal colleagues will perhaps reconsider before tomorrow whether they might not – including for reasons of parliamentary identity – join us once again as they did in the first and also in the second reading, because we will then be going into the conciliation procedure anyway and there we will have to see how much ground the Council can give. I believe – for environmental and competition reasons as well as on the basis of the decisions made two months ago, in January – that we should adopt these amendments tomorrow, in the form in which we debated them in the committee, with a broad majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken. This is very important. This is good for the environment. Investments are already being made, in anticipation of the directive. For example, in Antwerp, very near to where I live, a huge installation is being built which was not there before. As such, this directive is already coming into effect in a sense. </p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, as already highlighted by Mr Jarzembowski, where we do not see eye to eye. How do we charge the fees? We are all agreed on the polluter pays principle. But should he pay an automatic full amount or a huge amount in port dues, or do we opt for a flexible arrangement, as is being proposed by the Council. Where is the best financial incentive, to use your words? I have sounded out a number of people on this subject. The opinions are divided. Habits, apparently, are also divided. In fact, ports in one and the same region apply different standards and percentages. There are also ports which change percentages at the last minute, if I may say so. I believe that as such, it is probably better if we in Parliament do not pin ourselves down on a fixed percentage. A flexible system under these conditions, as you said so yourself, should make up a substantial part of the costs. 0.01 is clearly not a substantial part. </p>
<p class="contents">It should also have an encouraging effect, as a flexible part is left open for people who operate on an environmentally-friendly basis, provided that the Commission keeps a close eye on this whole process and checks whether the system works. If the objectives of the directive cannot be achieved, we would expect the Commission to intervene, act, suggest changes and ensure that the system does work. </p>
<p class="contents">Fellow MEPs, we must rescue this directive and keep it come what may. I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive on account of a too principled stance on one point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These days, we know that waste has a habit of reappearing, often in a more harmful form. Large-scale pollution of the sea and the destruction of the animal life caused by shipwrecked tankers always attracts a great deal of attention. </p>
<p class="contents">Far less attention is given to the fact that seas are polluted on a daily basis by regular merchant navy ships and recreational yachts. It is high time that we laid down a comprehensive regulation which is easy to monitor and which ensures that shipping waste is collected and processed at ports in an environmentally-friendly manner. We can benefit from practical experience gained in ports such as my home town, Rotterdam. </p>
<p class="contents">The question is, of course, raised as to whether rules can have an adverse effect on smaller vessels. Historic museum ships and ships which, proportionately, call at many ports over a short distance have to pay more often as a result. I am under the impression that the rapporteur has sought the best possible solution and has listened carefully to the comments. Other solutions would probably have a less favourable effect on environmental protection, and my group can assent to this report on that basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No absolute consensus was found but that’s politics for you. </p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of how matters stand or what the final version of the report will be, and whatever the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament, it is bound to be an improvement on the previous situation. Waste management facilities are to be built in ports and I believe this directive will definitely help considerably in limiting marine pollution. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now evident, particularly from this debate, that there is a bone of contention here. There are clearly two systems: one in the North Sea, the ‘no special fee’ system, and the system in operation in all other ports, whereby ships are charged according to their use of port facilities. </p>
<p class="contents">I can understand my fellow Members’ concern that many unscrupulous masters will discharge waste at sea in order to avoid paying fees, but I would like to say that there is another side to the coin. The other side to the coin is that ports in Member States in the Mediterranean area, such as my own country, Greece, will face particularly stiff competition from ports in neighbouring non-EU countries as, of course, nothing will prevent masters of ships sailing through the Mediterranean from docking at Turkish or North-African ports so as to avoid paying the objectively high fees which are to apply in Community ports, irrespective of use of facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we have made some progress here. Let us hold on to the progress which we have made with this directive, namely the provision for a charging system based on certain objective criteria. I do not think that forcing the systems to converge, aside from problems with the principle of subsidiarity, will achieve the results we are hoping for, because there will always be ways of getting around the system, ways which are harmful to the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships. This rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches, severely damaging the environment and marine life. As a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year. The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced. That is why this directive is so important and why tonight I am pleased to welcome the progress that has been made in Council to reach a common position which will force ships to dispose of their waste at port reception facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also commend the work of the rapporteur, whose commitment reflects the strength of feeling within our committee to tackling this particular problem and a strong desire amongst parliamentarians of all parties to call a halt to this environmentally disastrous practice. I particularly welcome his strong support for the proposal that, in the interests of improving pollution prevention and avoiding distortions of competition, the environmental requirements should apply to all ships irrespective of the flag they fly and adequate waste reception facilities be made available in all ports throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">An area where British Labour Members take issue with the rapporteur is the way in which the polluter-pays principle is to be applied. The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances. For example, in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities, without the port getting involved, works well. It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players, including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we share the rapporteur's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution. That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extraordinarily important report. </p>
<p class="contents">It should be emphasised, in this context, that it is not mainly legislation that is missing. All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention, and the Baltic countries have also signed the Helsinki Convention. The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea. It is a question, rather, of increasing access to port reception facilities and of creating the motivation also to use these. </p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic is affected every year by a great many oil spills of greatly varying sizes. In Swedish waters alone, there are hundreds of these each year. The Baltic is also more vulnerable from an environmental point of view than many other seas. It is in this perspective that, with today’s decision, we are seeing the beginnings of a solution to which, in the very end, all the countries around the Baltic will contribute, including the applicant States of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This is, as I see it, a sphere in which we have everything to gain by cooperating across national borders. We can never in a million years solve Europe’s environmental problems alone. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word in the ear of those who, for financial reasons, are still hesitant: think what the alternative cost of cleaning up our seas would be. There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind. We shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that there is a series of principles which are universal, and with which we are therefore in complete agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">First, every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste. Secondly, polluters must pay, naturally.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships. However, what cannot happen is a battle leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports, where we find ourselves with a series of theoretically environmental measures on the protection of the coast or the sea, leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore on this issue that effective measures must be adopted because, if we are unable to adopt a suitable solution, then this directive will end in outright failure. And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged, all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The logical solution, for example, would be to establish the principle of a single tariff for all European ports, a tariff that is exactly the same, that would not give rise to any type of distortion in competition, or similar measures. Any decision that, for example, enables the Member States to grant subsidies to the different ports, would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward. In this respect, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their painstaking work throughout the discussion and throughout the negotiation of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution. I hope that I will shortly be able to provide you with a preliminary package of measures with the aim of monitoring the safety of oil tankers more effectively, measures that I hope we will be able to go on with, specifically making the most of the dramatic sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, a dramatic event which could mean that on this occasion we are able to overcome certain very specific interests that will undoubtedly be affected by the measures I shall be proposing in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while it is certain that accidents lead to tremendous problems and disasters, the reality is that most spillages result, not from accidents, but simply from the regular cleaning out of the holds of certain ships, which is obviously a totally reprehensible act.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that the legislation intended by this directive covers various aspects relating to the delivery of waste to ports. It obliges all Community ports to be equipped with appropriate reception facilities for waste, and to guarantee the planning of their management, which will be supervised by the authorities of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it obliges ships to deliver all ship-generated waste to the port, except where the ship has a sufficient storage capacity to enable it to arrive at the next stage, the next port.</p>
<p class="contents">It also obliges ships to notify the port that they are going to deliver waste prior to their arrival in the port, and to pay the cost of the reception facilities. And this is where the problem lies. As various speakers have already pointed out, this is where the positions of Parliament and the Commission differ fundamentally.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to ask that in this matter, also taking into account the fact that the Commission is going to support Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx – I will refer to the rest of the amendments later – you accept the initial draft. It is true that we are not specifying what percentage will have to be paid by the ships arriving at the port. It is true that we are leaving a margin of flexibility for the Member States, but it is also certain that, theoretically, 0.01, although it is a contribution, is not necessarily a significant contribution. Perhaps we could incorporate the word "significant" into the text instead of setting a fixed percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would suggest a solution of this type, incorporating Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx, which means that there is a revision process which enables us, if necessary, to introduce a fixed percentage if we see that the Member States are not making any progress with regard to this distribution and that this excess of flexibility makes this directive ineffective. But I would try, first of all, to take this step forward, making the position more flexible with the possibility of revising it.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, I would like to state that we consider the suggestions being made to be very positive and that, therefore, we could incorporate into the text of the directive, with some rewording that would enable coherence with current Community and international texts to be guaranteed, as well as coherence with the rest of the directive, amendments such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. That is, we are talking about practically all of the amendments and, in fact, the one we cannot accept – and I regret it, but I have already explained the reasons – is Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on, but the two reasons have already been stated. We are all working towards the same goal. The only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal. I would ask for support for a more positive position, supplemented – I insist – with Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx, which would provide us with the necessary guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would suggest that, instead of "by a percentage", the word "significant" could be incorporated if necessary, to make it obvious that we are not talking about 1% or 5% or 10%, but about a substantial figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks, Mr President. I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the Committee.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
