Yet, this agreement is aimed at creating a ‘Fiscal Stability Union’ both to reduce debt and to strengthen financial stability in the euro area.

Secondly, the Member States express their desire to increase fiscal discipline in this text, but the crisis will not be overcome with just measures in this area.

While agreements are necessary to greatly increase the competitive ethos of weak Member States, talking of an economic and budgetary union is taking things a step further. In addition, the European Parliament has called for a roadmap for Eurobonds. I can support that even less. This reduces the incentive for budgetary discipline, because it allows countries in difficulty to continue financing themselves at too low an interest rate. In Greece, interest rates that are too low have contributed to an influx of money which has proved impossible to repay, because of a lack of competitive ethos. That is why I am not in favour of the Eurobond. Moreover, it would be very expensive for countries that are currently able to lend at a low rate because of their strong budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I welcome the new agreement which is intended to help strengthen budgetary discipline. This is a step in the right direction, for two reasons: in their national laws, participating countries will commit themselves to balancing their budgets or producing a surplus and, eventually, the discipline will be tightened, thanks to a standard of 0.5% of gross domestic product for the budget deficit in the medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the provisions on containing public deficits are not strong enough to resolve the current crisis which is evident through an increased lack of confidence in the bonds issued by EU Member States. I think that this stalemate can only by overcome by measures for stimulating economic growth, targeted primarily at SMEs (for instance, by partially subsidising the interest levied on bank loans). An excessive public deficit must obviously be avoided. However, any new deviation is unrealistic, which makes me think what good these constraints are now.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I believe that Member States must retain total control over their tax rate and that competition between them in this area cannot be damaging, just as competition between companies benefits consumers. On the subject of a financial transaction tax, the example of Hungary speaks for itself regarding the impact: a fall in capital exposure to this country and a reduction in lending activity, which is also expected to be the impact across the whole EU, albeit perhaps at a slower rate than in Hungary’s case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is actually needed is sound governance of the euro area and a greater degree of budgetary discipline at Member State level. However, I am not aware whether, in its current form, the intergovernmental agreement addresses this essential requirement. I have some reservations regarding this new treaty which risks duplicating regulations and creating a split between the euro area and the remaining Member States without actually being needed at all. The structural deficit criterion of 0.5% of GDP can be included very well in the Stability and Growth Pact which is directly applicable in Member States. On the other hand, to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the decisions implementing the agreement’s provisions, the ideal solution would be for them to be adopted using the Community method, thereby remaining consistent with existing European law. Last but not least, I think that the provisions concerning fiscal union are vague at the moment and that too much emphasis is placed on austerity without offsetting this with some measures aimed at stimulating economic recovery and returning to economic growth, which is needed so much in order to defuse social tensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘Treaty’ basically institutionalises austerity policies, reduces the quality of life for the majority of European citizens, increases inequalities between the Member States and creates a multi-speed Europe. Its main concern is fiscal prudence at any cost (for example wage, pension and benefit cuts), without in any way limiting the catastrophic profiteering of financial markets and credit rating agencies. Furthermore, the provisions of the ‘Treaty’ undermine the democratic rights of Europeans by minimising their facility to exercise an alternative economic and fiscal policy via their elected governments.

This stance is a good demonstration of the relevance of the resolution’s content, as well as of the extreme importance of the issues tackled. This is, firstly, because of the importance given to absolute respect for democratic accountability by ‘strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance’, as can be read in the resolution and, obviously, in the European Treaties. It is also, however, because of the focus given to ‘a Union of both stability and sustainable growth’; that is, it emphasises the need to promote, starting with the fiscal discipline that must be the indisputable foundation of the future agreement, measures whose purpose is growth that is sustainable over the long term. This will enable greater convergence between the Member States, make our economy more competitive and, obviously, create jobs. Finally, it is also because it introduces concrete measures, of which I would stress the issuing of project bonds, a financial transaction tax and a roadmap to stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under pressure from Germany, European leaders have agreed on a new treaty to tighten fiscal discipline in the euro area and deepen economic integration. These steps should help to solve the debt crisis. The form of the new treaty, agreed at the European summit, was vetoed by the United Kingdom, however, which sought concessions in exchange for supporting the changes to existing EU treaties. Bypassing the British veto, leading EU representatives, led by France and Germany, are promoting a new treaty outside the legal framework of the EU. The crisis in the monetary union is a result of macroeconomic imbalances. It was not caused by irresponsible management, and if we are insufficiently aware of this fact, then the recipes based on this logic will not work either, of course. France and Germany basically announced their own decision without consulting the standard methods or the other Member States. If the EU is to work on this principle, and if the Franco-German proposal is to be promoted from the institutional perspective, in my opinion in an absolutely undemocratic manner and contrary to the fundamental values of the Union, then the democratic legitimacy of the process is really questionable in this case. I firmly believe that if we sacrifice democracy in favour of the power games of the strongest European nations, it will literally be civilisation that loses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We delude ourselves if we think that the European Parliament is the only institution with a democratic mandate. The community method that so many in the European Parliament adore is a time-consuming process and not one that is well suited to resolving the current crisis. The Parliament is not only wrong about the process of this agreement, but also the content. The introduction of a financial transaction tax will do nothing to solve the current crisis. Indeed, the Commission’s own impact assessment demonstrates that its introduction will make all our constituents poorer.

According to the resolution, we need not only austerity measures, but also the promotion of economic growth, the levying of taxes on financial transactions, and bonds to alleviate the present shortage of funds. Personally I am missing from this draft, which has been recast several times now and still does not represent a final version, guarantees that would ensure that in the implementation of its measures the European Union will follow the EU method of decision-making which ensures democratic transparency and accountability.

Better involving national parliaments and the European Parliament in these decisions could also help to improve the democratic accountability of these decisions and improve their credibility for citizens.

While fiscal discipline is a necessary part of a stable and sustainable economy, it cannot alone bring about a return to growth.

The negotiation group granted to the European Parliament is a far cry from allowing fair representation of European citizens in this discussion. The resolution voted through may have voiced some criticisms and reservations as regards the draft treaty, but it is too timid on these points and that is why I abstained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is, above all, a question of policy. This resolution was adopted by 521 votes to 124. I find this deeply regrettable.

The legal status of the agreement within the framework of the existing system of EU law must be clearly defined. It is important to ensure that this agreement does not conflict with the EU Treaties, and it must be incorporated within the EU Treaties as quickly as possible, thus maintaining EU unity. Parallel institutions should not be created that might give rise to competition between the EU-27 and the Member States that will be parties to this intergovernmental agreement. In view of the fact that many EU Member States, when joining the EU, undertook to introduce the euro and have not yet done so, an opportunity should be provided for these states to choose when the agreement shall be binding upon them, either after they have fully joined the euro area or earlier. In implementing the European Commission’s proposals for eliminating excessive budget deficits the principle of a voluntary commitment to comply with them should be retained, and support for them should not be mandatory. Similarly, an accurate explanation is needed of the qualified majority of votes required to reject the Commission’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EU needs to find a solution to the euro zone problems and to implement measures ensuring full fiscal discipline in the future. This can effectively only be done through Community Method and acknowledging the primacy of EU law. Only this will guarantee the credibility of the actions and tangible results. I reiterate the EP call to the Council that the agreement must be in conformity with EU law, in particular as regards the figures in the Stability and Growth Pact, following EU legal procedures and excluding any double standards. Democratic accountability must be guaranteed by strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance. The most important concern is not to split the EU 27. The non-euro zone members need to participate in the meetings of 17. The other need is to avoid as much as possible creation of new institutions and mechanisms. The third challenge is to promote parallel to financial discipline closer convergence and stronger competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight.

The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits.

The representatives who were directly elected by European citizens are being excluded from the current negotiations which are limited to the inner sanctum of governments and exclude national parliaments and the European Parliament. By taking on the appearance of a negotiation between States, the most democratic bodies are only being granted the role of approving what is already a done deal. This denial of democracy is even more intolerable as it puts the very future of the European project at stake, swapping European solidarity for calls for austerity from the European Central Bank and the Commission. The surveillance and sanctioning mechanisms provided for are a way of bringing States’ economic policy to heel, preventing them from restarting their economies through consumption and investment. The Union must, on the contrary, completely overhaul its economic foundations and move towards a new pact of social progress which puts human beings as its priority. A European Central Bank, at the service of the people, must be the instrument for this ambition by rewarding creators of wealth and public goods with investments in education, training, research, infrastructure and public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quick decisions taken over people’s heads without establishing a basis for them or debating them in Parliament or with the people will not relieve the crisis. Instead they will increase the gap between the people and their politicians. However, despite the fact that we agree with some of the criticism of the international agreement put forward in the resolution, we cannot support the resolution as a whole, as we cannot support the solutions that are proposed, such as closer economic convergence, stability bonds and a fiscal union. The crisis is bigger than the euro. It is a crisis affecting the whole of the economic system on which the EU is based, and these proposals will not solve the fundamental problems with this system. At best they can simply defer the problems to sometime in the future. Growth-promoting measures based on borrowed money will result in a constant spiral of increased borrowing, increased interest payments and thus an even greater requirement for growth in order to pay the interest and create jobs. This will inevitably lead to recurring crises and collapses, with the collapses having serious social consequences and the periods of economic growth causing increased consumption of resources.

<p class="contents">Leaving aside the debate as to whether the Community method is preferable to the intergovernmental method, as indicated in this resolution, it would be more important to underline how the ‘EU method’ itself is failing miserably. In its best manifestation, the European Union and the euro should have been able to guarantee more prosperity and security for all, in a climate of reciprocal advantages. None of this has happened, and the benefits, which have been marginal, have been limited to a few Member States, first and foremost to Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I appreciated and share the position of Mr Cameron, who at least defended the interests of his people, and did not accept once again having to submit to the decisions of the others, which always only benefit the same few. At such a delicate time Member States have a duty to defend their prerogatives and their specific natures, and therefore I do not believe the line emerging from this resolution is sustainable, as it seems to wish to persist along the path of strengthening the EU in the name of utopian ideals that, in actual fact, have turned out to be totally unachievable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Signing and ratifying the agreement in the form proposed will lead to the emergence of an alternative legal order, whose relation with European law in many areas remains undefined. Unresolved issues include those concerning the primacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the competences of the other European institutions. Another unresolved but important issue is the question of insufficient democratic legitimacy, because democratic legitimacy can be achieved only by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. From the point of view of economic governance, it should however be noted that most of the provisions of the proposed intergovernmental agreement can be put into effect more quickly and effectively by using the Community method and the Stability and Growth Pact, which was amended in December. The approach followed by the Community method also makes it possible for countries which are not part of the euro area to be included in the decision-making process, and this in turn allows the need for additional EU institutions to be avoided. In relation to this, notice should be taken of the European Parliament’s proposal that all parties to the agreement, including both present and future members of the euro area, should have the right to participate in Euro Group summits, because it should be remembered that the euro area does not operate on an opt-in basis, and the countries which do not belong to the euro area are the subject of what is only a temporary derogation. Inclusiveness in the process for making decisions on economic governance is therefore in the interest of all, because the majority of the Member States have committed themselves to join the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the resolution that has been tabled undermines all the work and all the effort that our governments have put in. As Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, the initiators of the agreement, have said many times: this agreement represents ‘the highest common denominator’. This is no game. This is not the time to be entering a plea of non-admissibility in the interminable battle between the ‘bad intergovernmental method’ and ‘good federalism’. Any level of willingness is a positive thing. The agreement is so far-reaching that we will be losing a significant player in the process: the United Kingdom. Of course I am in favour of a strong European Parliament. We bear the weighty responsibility of representing half a billion people. However, let us not go beyond our remit. The issue on the table was to resolve the debt crisis affecting sovereign states. It is therefore up to the States alone to find a solution. They have done so, as we Members of the European Parliament have been asking them to do for a long time. All we needed to do was to emphasise this point.

As such, it is crucial to find solutions that are able to restore market confidence and, at the same time, that safeguard the values, principles and institutional framework on which the European project is founded. From this perspective, it is important to recognise that the new treaty for stability, coordination and governance in the economic and monetary union – which should be agreed on 30 January and involve the leaders of all the Member States, with the exception of the United Kingdom – is far from the ideal solution, since it represents a strengthening of intergovernmentalism at the expense of the Community method. Whatever the case, it is important to maintain a constructive position here: the European Parliament should do everything to seek to deepen the Union framework of this treaty and to expand its scope so that, as well as budgetary discipline, it also covers an agenda for growth and for solidarity between the Member States.

The agreement, however, is becoming totally meaningless as regards the current crisis. Its name has already been changed several times along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to correct my fellow Member: Finland has not as yet adopted an official position on the economic agreement. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Tuomioja, and not Prime Minister Katainen, made his position known earlier in the week, and suggested that Finland should boycott the agreement. The biggest problem in Finland was seen to be that the agreement might clash with the constitution. Talks on the agreement, however, are still continuing. In the end, I do not believe that the United Kingdom will be the only Member State to remain outside the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly not the content of the agreement that presents the greatest problem. The content is a very welcome addition to the rules on finance and budgetary discipline that were agreed back in the 1990s, rules which not even the biggest countries in the EU have been able to, bothered to or wanted to keep to. The problem is the bypassing of the parliamentary system. Europe’s only directly elected institution, the European Parliament, has been completely ignored in the attempts to find a solution to the economic crisis. In my opinion, the European Parliament should not be disregarded. Perhaps, after this, we will be able to concentrate on the issue itself, that is, remedying the current economic situation and restoring the confidence of the public and the markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement is useless and is not needed for the EU to be equipped with tools to deal with the financial and sovereign debt crises, as the drafting process for this agreement and the markets’ response have underlined. The draft agreement, with its one-dimensional focus on fiscal contraction, fails to deliver a convincing economic response to the immediate crisis. We will only draw a line under this crisis through a comprehensive response. This means accompanying measures on fiscal restraint with measures to guarantee the long-term economic viability of the euro area and its members. More specifically, it implies providing an effective firewall in the short-run and introducing eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and a meaningful sustainable growth and employment strategy as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, we should welcome the fact that a political will is emerging within the countries of the euro area to go further and faster to integrate their economies and to put the Stability and Growth Pact into practice. We should nonetheless take care not to create a two-track legal system, and to make sure we bring on board the States that have not yet adopted the euro.

Quick decisions taken over people’s heads without establishing a basis for them or debating them in Parliament or with the people will not relieve the crisis. Instead they will increase the gap between the people and their politicians. However, despite the fact that we agree with some of the criticism of the international agreement put forward in the resolution, we cannot support the resolution as a whole, as we cannot support the solutions that are proposed, such as closer economic convergence, stability bonds and a fiscal union. The crisis is bigger than the euro. It is a crisis affecting the whole of the economic system on which the EU is based, and these proposals will not solve the fundamental problems with this system. At best they can simply defer the problems to sometime in the future. Growth-promoting measures based on borrowed money will result in a constant spiral of increased borrowing, increased interest payments and thus an even greater requirement for growth in order to pay the interest and create jobs.

Despite the fact that the fiscal compact contains many positive measures which impose financial discipline on participating countries, many doubts have also emerged over its operation. Firstly, we have to answer the question about how the compact will affect the transparency of decision-making processes in the Union, because under the terms of the compact a parallel system of cooperation is created, and the precise date of its incorporation into the Treaties is difficult to specify. Will this not weaken European Union integration? Secondly, critics point out that the fiscal compact duplicates many of the measures contained, for example, in the ‘six-pack’ and the Stability and Growth Pact. Will this fact not create confusion in the interpretation of certain acts of EU law? Thirdly, there is a risk that the compact will create divisions within the Union, the consequences of which are difficult to foresee. Very worrying aspects include plans not to allow participation in Eurosummit meetings by countries which have announced a desire to be part of the compact and which want to adopt the common currency. Fourthly, recent changes in the draft of the document lead to marginalisation of the role of the EU institutions. The European Commission is deprived of the possibility of lodging complaints about Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was always its area of responsibility, and the European Parliament’s participation in Eurosummit meetings is being greatly marginalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If EU legislation currently in force had been properly implemented and had been properly upheld, we would not need additional legislation or more stringent agreements. Our prospects nevertheless remain bleak. According to data from Business Monitor International, this year Lithuania’s public debt is expected to reach 43% of GDP (as compared to 15.6% in 2008). I really hope that non-euro area Member States will be able to participate in negotiations on equal terms. The majority of Lithuanians are sceptical about the introduction of the euro against the backdrop of the debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the euro area. A survey carried out last month showed that 49% of Lithuanians are against the introduction of the euro and just 43% are in favour of it. This long-term Treaty is not enough for Lithuanians.

Taxation requires the unanimous approval of all 27 Member States and the UK has made it unambiguously clear that it will block such a tax as it would disproportionately affect my home constituency of London. The Commission’s own statistics reveal that the FTT would cost long-term growth in the EU EUR 220 billion with a 90 % decline in derivatives trading.

If Europe is to overcome the crisis successfully, the Member States must regain the trust of the financial markets. The only proper way to regain trust is to take responsibility. Seeking other means, such as borrowing money for ineffective national and European projects, is precisely the type of thinking that led us into the crisis. It is a road to new public debts, a road to hell. I cannot therefore support a resolution that promotes the establishment of project bonds, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and stabilisation bonds. It is true that, if we are to overcome the crisis, it is not enough to reassess the level of well-being guaranteed by the State. It is necessary to create conditions that motivate the initiative of citizens, simplify their business and increase labour productivity.

Firstly, the call in paragraph 5 of the resolution to introduce such measures as a Europe-wide financial transaction tax and so-called stability bonds conflicts with the political positions of the majority of EU Member States. Agreement at intergovernmental level on these items has not yet been reached. Secondly, the scepticism expressed in paragraph 1 of the resolution regarding an intergovernmental agreement as a form for achieving the EU’s fiscal goals is not justified. The Council decided upon an intergovernmental agreement (a fiscal compact) precisely in order to avoid the long and complicated procedure of amending the EU Treaties, which would run counter to the current main task of convincing the financial markets that the euro area and the EU as a whole is determined to resolve this enormous crisis with speed and certainty. Thirdly, I cannot support the call to use the Community method to transform monetary union into ‘true economic and fiscal union’, which the majority of Member States wishing to retain their sovereignty may find unacceptable.
