Living organisms in these rivers have been destroyed over many hundreds of kilometres and the drinking water for thousands of people is under threat. The environmental disaster itself is bad enough but, to make matters worse, companies, politicians and the media in Romania have sought to deny and prevent news about this incident getting out. When I read that assertions are being made to the effect that this is a conspiracy on the part of their Hungarian neighbours, I realise that now is the time for the European Parliament to make it clear to Romania in no uncertain terms that this is not the way we want to behave towards each other in Europe, or how we want to solve problems. That is not how it works! One has to consider the problems, establish the causes and do everything possible to prevent them from recurring.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, two things have happened here: firstly an international company has been negligent. If this large vat of cyanide had only a flimsy protective covering then in no way does that accord with the environmental standards we have in Europe and other parts of the world. Secondly, there are major loopholes in the environmental protection legislation in a country that is in the process of applying to join the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Three things need to be done: the European Union must deliver technical and financial aid with all haste, so as to combat this contamination. This episode has shown that not only do we need rapid reaction forces in the military sense, we also need them for civil disasters. Secondly, we also need to assist the Romanians in drafting new environmental legislation and standards. Thirdly, we need a liability system for environmental damage. This case demonstrates that environmental protection is part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and is one of the conditions of entry to our European Union.</p>

This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union. We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström’s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness. After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time. </p>
<p class="contents">The polluter ought to pay. I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called ‘Wild East’, making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.

Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe. The delta of the Danube is in danger. As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations. This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in candidate countries. The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles. First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards. But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility. The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent. It must form the basis for our partners’ political will. Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts already being made need to be stepped up. The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>

The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised. I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe. We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again. If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today. Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals? The answer, of course, is an emphatic no. There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide. I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance. It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now. That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs. </p>
<p class="contents">I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened. My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required. </p>
<p class="contents">This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type. It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States. We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people’s health and the ecosystems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">as the most recent incident in the series of environmental disasters caused by human beings.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Only a few days later we are able to add another terrible environmental disaster to the list. These episodes always spring from the same sources, namely inadequate technology and also maximisation of profit, which is evidently prized more highly than the well-being of the environment, and of course the health and well-being of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Someone has already mentioned, in this connection, how vital it is for the European Union to provide both technical and financial aid. However we must also make it clear to Romania that it cannot wriggle out of this, but must work hard at fulfilling the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. In addition, I believe it is imperative that we draft and implement a directive on comprehensive environmental liability within the European Union with all speed.</p>

For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions. Who is going to pay? Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is. I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.</p>

<p class="contents">An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage. But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy. It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days. No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared. Several Members have set out what seems to have happened. We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens. Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl. It has affected the peoples of three countries – Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. It is the Tisza, Hungary’s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt. As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious. Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river. There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.</p>
<p class="contents">We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe. That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today. The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand ready to do so. We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently. The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts. We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial. It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it. It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities. This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested. The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy. It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due. The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin. In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place. The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today. But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis. As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today. She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
