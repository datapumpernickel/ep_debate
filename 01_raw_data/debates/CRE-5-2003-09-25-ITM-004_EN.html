<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry, Roy (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, in 1997, an English lady, who is so fearful that she still has to remain known as Madam X, submitted a petition to this Parliament. She simply questioned whether the British Government was properly regulating Lloyd’s of London in accordance with Insurance Directive 73/239/EEC. The same question or allegation has subsequently been made in other petitions, some signed by hundreds of Names and several on behalf of thousands.</p>
<p class="contents">Since being appointed rapporteur I have come to know Madam X and she has told me her story. She recognised that by investing with Lloyd’s and becoming a 'Name' – I should explain, for non-Anglophone listeners, that means a passive external investor whose affairs were managed by Lloyd's as approved agents – she recognised that she was exposing herself to <span class="italic">unlimited liability</span>. But she told me that she only took on that risk because she believed Lloyd’s was regulated in accordance with British and European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the United Kingdom's Permanent Representative to the EU, sent a strongly-worded letter to Mr Gemelli, Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, effectively seeking to block this Parliament’s right to get to the facts. I am pleased that our own legal services – who say Parliament must be very wary of attempts from representatives of other institutions to limit our powers – have confirmed that there is nothing in the rules to stop us having a parliamentary inquiry, so long as the terms of reference differ from any question before the courts in a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkestein will speak for himself, but what he has said to the Petitions Committee, and his actions, clearly indicate that he has concerns about the regulation of Lloyd's. He sent long questionnaires and received responses. Unfortunately, those letters and responses have never been made public or made available to the Petitions Committee or to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question that the petitioners pose is this: does Lloyd’s have the reserves to cover their liabilities, as Directive 73/239/EEC requires? Answering that requires an audited statement of the reserves and an authoritative estimate of the liabilities. Perhaps the Commissioner can give us the figures – in particular with reference to the old liabilities at Lloyd's that they sought to separate in the scheme known as Equitas.</p>
<p class="contents">The petitioners are not questioning this Parliament about the present regime, which the Commissioner now thinks may be satisfactory. They have asked us about the period from 1978, when the directive should have taken effect, to 2000, when they submitted their petitions – or, in Madam X's case, 1997. Was the directive being applied then? The Commission so far is seeking to remain silent about that period, a period when the assets of the petitioners were being seized and some were being made bankrupt, when policy-holders were at risk if the reserves were not there and when other insurance undertakings across Europe were having to comply with the directive, a period when the English courts in various rulings said that Lloyd’s did not have a system in place for making proper reserves. In 2000 Mr Justice Cresswell pointed out that the catalogue of failings and incompetence in the 1980s by underwriters, managing agents, members' agents, and others was staggering and brought disgrace on one of the City’s great markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not ask the Commissioner to take action against the British Government for any failings in that period. He has to bring a Member State into compliance. I simply ask for an authoritative answer – <span class="italic">yes</span> or <span class="italic">no.</span> Between 1978 and 2000 was the British Government correctly applying EU Insurance Directive 73/239/EEC? I respect the Commissioner, I know him to be an honest man. I hope that we will be able to get a straight answer.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been great pressure applied by the British Government, but this must not be a case where a big country is let off the hook. If the Commission can assure us and explain how the regulation respected the directive, that is an answer we can give to the petitioners. However, if the Commission believes that, prior to the adoption of the Financial Services Act, the British Government was not in compliance, it must say so. We need to get to the truth of what happened and why thousands were ruined.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will give formal answers. There should be no need to have a committee of inquiry. That is why I have tabled an amendment giving the Commission six weeks to give a full, authoritative and written answer to this House. However, failing that, Parliament must reserve its right to have the fullest inquiry into this lamentable case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many Members of Parliament will know, this is in fact the fourth time that I personally have had the opportunity to discuss the case with Members of Parliament, and in particular with Members of the Petitions Committee. In addition to my own appearances before Parliament, we have also kept Parliament fully informed of developments by regular, written updates supplemented by oral presentations made by my staff at meetings of the Petitions Committee. Furthermore, I have also responded to an extensive postbag from Members on the subject. In this way the Commission has sought to keep Parliament fully informed to the greatest extent procedurally possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these extensive antecedents, I do not propose to go over the general background to this case. Rather, I would propose to focus on developments since I last spoke to this Parliament, which was at the Petitions Committee hearing on 22 January 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">By letter dated 24 March 2003, the Commission received a comprehensive reply from the UK authorities to the supplementary letter of formal notice sent by the Commission on 23 January 2003 which expressed some residual concerns about the new regulatory regime for Lloyd's established under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. After analysis of this reply, and further written and oral clarifications provided by the UK authorities, the Commission services consider that the new arrangements are compatible with the requirements of Directive 73/239/EEC – that is to say the First Non-life Assurance Directive, as amended. These requirements related primarily to the verification of solvency, the auditing arrangements, the adequacy of the administrative and accounting procedures and the internal control mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to respect the procedural rights of complainants, in the second half of July 2003 my services wrote to all complainants, as well as to petitioners who had not lodged a formal complaint, explaining the results of this preliminary analysis and indicating the intention of the services to propose that the Commission should close the case. My services are now completing their analysis of the responses received from complainants before preparing a proposal for a final decision on the case by the College of Commissioners. In accordance with Parliament's wish, we shall be seeking to take this decision as quickly as possible, before the end of October 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the comments received related to the past situation, before the introduction of the FSMA 2000. As I have already explained to this Parliament and to complainants, the objective of infringement proceedings under Community law is to ensure or restore the compatibility of national law with Community law, not to rule on the past compatibility or incompatibility of the prior regime. That is a task – I say this in particular to Mr Perry – for national courts to address. From the beginning of our investigations into this complex and sensitive file, we have repeatedly made it clear to complainants that any action for damages must be undertaken before national courts. Indeed, I understand that, currently, such an action has been instigated by a group of complainants before UK courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in accordance with the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice, the task of the Commission is to examine the compatibility of the new regime with the requirements of the insurance directives.</p>
<p class="contents">During our investigations, access to the file has been a hotly-debated subject. From my opening comments I trust Members will recognise that, throughout the conduct of its enquiries, the Commission has always sought to keep Parliament fully informed to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report by the Petitions Committee recognises, the Commission is bound by point 1.5 of Annex III to the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission. This provides that information on infringement procedures remains confidential until a final Commission decision is made.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, after a final decision, the Commission will make documents available, subject to any remaining confidentiality constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming a decision is taken by the College of Commissioners to close the case, the Commission will, in response to a formal request from Parliament, provide file access in accordance with the Framework Agreement subject to the respect of any confidentiality requirements imposed by the UK on documents which it has prepared. Furthermore, general public access to the file will be granted in accordance with the terms of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like briefly to touch upon an issue which, in the light of the extensive contacts we have enjoyed with Parliament, I had hoped would not be necessary. There are those who imply that, in the conduct of its enquiries, the Commission has exposed itself to accusations of maladministration and unnecessary delay. Let me be clear. Despite the complexity and sensitivity of the case and the considerable volume of correspondence received, the Commission has always sought to carry out its investigations as rapidly as possible, consistent with due process and thorough investigation, while subject to real constraints on resources. Petition 318/2000 runs to seven lever-arch A4 files. The Commission has carefully examined complaints and entered into substantial and sustained communication with complainants. Two press releases were issued and sent to all complainants and petitioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as I have just said, in accordance with the procedural safeguards for complainants, the Commission services have written to all complainants informing them of the results of the Commission's preliminary analysis and seeking their comments. Finally, an allegation of Commission maladministration has recently been examined by Mr Diamandouros, the European Ombudsman, and rejected by him. In particular, may I respectfully remind Parliament that Mr. Diamandouros specifically considered allegations of Commission maladministration regarding access to files and examination of the current regulatory regime, as opposed to the past, pre-FSMA 2000 regime. In both cases Mr Diamandouros found no maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken somewhat longer than I would have preferred but, given the importance of the case and the tragic stories that surround it, I wanted to be crystal clear in my statement to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, let me again assure you, President, of the willingness of the Commission to cooperate fully with Parliament. This cooperation is, however, always subject to the legal constraints imposed on the Commission. As on previous occasions, I would be very happy to try and answer any further questions you might have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would merely like to retrace our steps in this debate for a moment to, when talking about petitions and the gargantuan ventures brought about by globalisation, I made an analogy: the citizen and the giant. There is an enormous discrepancy between the citizen and the giant. Parliament should now ask itself what it can to do protect citizen’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a situation – as Mr Perry has made very clear by mentioning a case in point – which affects many citizens who have gone bankrupt. There are a large number of trials under way in the United States and some in Europe too with many in the United Kingdom. How can we not wonder what the solution to this situation is and how it will develop? How can we not ask Parliament, how can we not even ask ourselves what we should do to resolve this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Lloyd’s of London is a large institution, which still enjoys worldwide credibility, but clearly, at some point, something happened, there was some error, because, otherwise, there would not have been this proliferation of cases reported by the citizens. There are now those who are calling for a committee of inquiry to be set up and those who oppose this, but it is not a problem that must be resolved in court, not least because we do not want to start legal proceedings, because we are not qualified to start proceedings and because we do not want there to be adverse parties. All we want to do is respond to the requests of the citizens, because this is our mandate: a mandate of representation that we must fulfil completely by representing both the citizens and institutions such as Lloyd’s of London. I therefore do not intend to criminalise anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, I want to understand why this situation exists. If the Commission’s reply, when it arrives, is not comprehensive, then only an inquiry which we can carry out without any pressure will reveal the crux of the matter, the gap, the loophole through which this great mistake, which has caused so much harm, managed to slip. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I cannot support this report. I believe it to be highly selective and deeply flawed. It fails to give a balanced assessment. The quotes used in the report are highly selective and outside the context, and therefore fail to give a fair summary of the legal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are errors of fact, for example relating to the Lloyd's accounting system. Closed accounts do not, as is suggested, come back to life. Rather, as with all insurance, claims are made against a policy after it has ended. The report states that directives have not been implemented. This is an opinion. It has not been proven. Also, the report does not detail the substantial efforts made by Lloyd's to alleviate the Names' losses. But there were also problems within the Committee on Petitions. I repeatedly pointed out that the way Mr Perry was trying to set up a committee of inquiry was not the correct way, was against the Rules of Procedure and, indeed, the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Sir Nigel Sheinwald did not seek to block an inquiry, but pointed out quite rightly, that any inquiry should be within the Rules of Procedure and indeed our Treaties. Let me quote the relevant section of his letter. He believes that 'they do not permit a committee of inquiry to be established where the alleged facts are being examined before a court and while the case is still subject to legal proceedings'. As we have heard from the Commissioner, there is now a case before the Appeal Court of the United Kingdom, and it is right that we should be very careful and considered before we set up a committee of inquiry. Again, Mr Perry has used comments and quotes from the Jaffrey case in the Court of Appeal selectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on and on, but let me reassure Mr Perry. The PSE Group will vote in favour of his amendments. I believe his amendments actually tie up some of the problems that we have been dealing with. Indeed I am pleased that at my suggestion Parliament's services have called for other changes and, in particular, the deletion of Mr Perry's insistence in paragraph 5 that his explanatory statement should be incorporated into the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just some concrete examples of changes that had to be made to a deeply flawed report. I will finish on this. If, in this Parliament, we raise expectations for citizens and petitioners that we cannot meet, we do so at our peril. Mr Perry's process throughout has been genuine and sincere, but I believe he is raising expectations that cannot be met. He is demanding documents that he knows cannot be supplied. I am the author of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. Mr Perry is making demands of the Commission for an inquiry which he knows the Commission cannot make.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the PSE Group will support this but, in all honesty I have to say to the House, with my hand on my heart, I cannot support this report and therefore I will not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, there is a wider issue at play here, which affects the good functioning of Community law. I was a rapporteur for the last two years on the reports on the implementation and monitoring of Community law. As a Parliament we then called on the Commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants, calling in particular for correspondence passing between the Commission and the Member States to be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the area that any committee of inquiry should, and can, examine: the Commission's carrying out of its supervisory duty in implementing Community law. This need have nothing whatever to do with the current English High Court proceedings. It is about getting an answer for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Any committee of inquiry must get to grips with this central question about the efficiency of infringement proceedings. It must be said that this history goes back a long way to 1997. With the greatest respect to the Commissioner – and I have the utmost respect for his work – to say that everything is in order now is not entirely satisfactory. If the Commission cannot carry out its role as Guardian of the Treaties, this is really <span class="italic">very</span> serious and the whole legal framework of the Union can accordingly be brought into disrepute and called into question.

The EU Treaties acknowledge that it may be necessary to subject European matters to parliamentary scrutiny. In so doing, it is not the intention to call into question the work of the Commission in monitoring the proper application of EU law by the Member States.

<p class="contents">What worries me, however, is that I sometimes have the same feeling about our own Parliament, for example in connection with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.

<p class="contents">Reading the report about the Lloyd’s Petitions left me, in the first place, with the impression that matters remain which require further clarification. In the second place, it seems to me that neither the government of the United Kingdom nor the European Commission wants to go into this in more detail, although you have made an overture. We are curious. In the third place, some fellow Members seem more keen on protecting their own governments than adopting a responsible attitude towards citizens and demonstrating that the law is the same for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issues, arising from multi-billion-euro losses in the '80s and the '90s, many related to asbestos, can only be dealt with satisfactorily through the establishment of a committee of inquiry. This matter is not going to go away. A resolution is clearly overdue and the question of compensation cannot be side-stepped. At the heart of the issue is the failure to implement properly the 1973 First Non-life Assurance Directive and subsequent relevant directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Many investors were bankrupted, some committed suicide and we need to know why, who was at fault and why there was a delay in the implementation of European Union law. The petitioners and complainants invested in what they thought was a properly regulated market according to UK and EU law. Would they have invested if they had been aware of the undisclosed liabilities? We have to take seriously the claims that a proper audit into the firms was not carried out. If it had been carried out, then the extent of the potential losses might have been discovered. The huge losses and the needless human suffering might have been avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lloyd's petitioners are not only from the UK: they come from my country, Ireland, as well, and indeed also from Denmark and Germany, not to mention the investors who brought cases before the courts in the United States. Still there is no resolution of the problem at European Union level, still the Commission sits on the fence and speaks about the complexity of the issue. Complex or not, the petitioners have a right to know why European Union rules for the regulation of Lloyd's were not properly implemented. An in-depth inquiry is needed to answer all these questions; after all we are dealing with investors who, if catastrophe strikes, have to pay and pay to the point where they can lose their businesses and their homes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I am now reasonably content with the outcome of Mr Perry's report, I must, in the interests of balance, make some comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry's explanatory statement does not give a fair and balanced account of the circumstances surrounding the underwriting losses of Lloyd's members in the 1980s. I would cite in particular its highly selective use of material and its failure to reflect the full findings of the UK Court of Appeal in the Jaffrey case, including its view that it was only with the benefit of hindsight that reserves established by syndicates for asbestos liabilities in the 1980s proved to be inadequate, given the unanticipated way in which those liabilities developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I have tremendous sympathy for the Names who suffered these underwriting losses, among whom are a number of my friends, including the godparents of one of my own children. Yet, since I became involved in this case, I have been subjected to a torrent of abuse and vituperation, including anonymous abusive telephone calls to my home accusing me of being a paid agent of Lloyd's. Since 97% of the Lloyd's Names have accepted the renewal plan of 1996 and they have been able to reduce their liabilities by significant amounts, this issue has by and large been covered fully.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in all the advertisements: you cannot guarantee that past profit is an indication of future gain.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of Mr Perry's report and the real allegation of the petitioners is, as I understand it, that the UK Government failed to implement the terms of EU insurance law correctly in its supervision of Lloyd's. The UK Government denies this allegation. The real place to adjudicate, therefore, is in a court of law. That is exactly what is happening, as there is now such a case before the English High Court.</p>
<p class="contents">These are complex legal issues. Parliament should let the legal process run its course and allow the Court to reach a proper decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I encourage the Commission to respond to those issues raised in this report and to reply as fully as possible. While we need answers as soon as is reasonable, I would caution against a rush to judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I urge this House to support Mr Perry's amended report and, until the due process has been exhausted, go no further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Mr Perry has drafted a report and has presented certain elements of the Lloyd’s case to us. The Commissioner has given us a series of enlightening explanations today which are indeed valuable. And Mr Cashman contests Mr Perry's information. What emerges from this? That our concern at this moment in time is not the substance of the matter, nor are we a court. Our concern at this moment in time is this, and only this: after five years of reports, we want to maintain the credibility of our committee and, consequently, our problem is whether we shall receive a definitive answer as to the extent to which the directive was or was not applied. That is our only concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I am seizing this opportunity to generalise this concern, because today we had the reports from the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. The Lloyd’s issue came to the Committee on Petitions with petitions from citizens. The Ombudsman was also involved, as the Commissioner said, in the issue of the extent to which the Commission did its job properly. And, of course, it is a question of the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">What emerges from this? That the two twin rights, of accusation and petition, are interlinked. They should not therefore be debated separately. Secondly, with these two reports, the whole issue of the proper application of Community law is involved; in other words, the extent to which this report should also be jointly debated today. I therefore propose to Parliament, the Commission and my honourable friends that we look at the possibility of examining these reports jointly because, materially, they are the only reports which directly concern the European citizen. As, therefore, we are all interested in reinforcing the participation of the European citizen, I think we should give some emphasis to this debate and I even think that we should declare the day of the debate in Parliament to be the day of the European citizen. Thus, we shall be reliable and we shall say that we really are interested in their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what we are calling for, after five years, is a clear picture at least of what is going on. So what we want is to obtain this clear picture in a short space of time because Mr Cashman may in fact be right. However, we do not know at this moment who is right. And the Commission has indeed been neglectful. Thus, I shall raise the more general concern. The Committee on Petitions often delays its final conclusions because we have a time-consuming procedure on the part of the Commission on the question of petitions. Could it not shorten this period of time so that we too are more credible in the eyes of the European citizens who come and say to us, it has been eighteen months and we have not had a reply? These are the more general concerns that are being aired in today's debate and I think it is a golden opportunity for us to use them in the interest, naturally, of the European Union, but more importantly, for us to give European citizens to understand that we stand by them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the problem remains, as my honourable friend Mr Koukiadis has highlighted in such a proper and constructive manner, that we do not have clear answers to the following: the British government was obviously very late in transposing into national legislation the directive which should also have applied in Great Britain to the issue of the private insurance which would also cover the Lloyd's case. Similarly, there is doubt as to whether it transposed it correctly. In addition, questions arise as to if it is applying it correctly and consistently ensuring it is complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of names, who are, as it were, the shareholders – it is a very particular regime – were obliged, because they were not informed or information was withheld from them and as a result of the omissions by the British government which I referred to earlier, to use all their assets to pay compensation for insurance risks of which they maintain they were ignorant. Thus, many of them were ruined, we are talking about huge assets, while despair led some of them to suicide. The victims include some of my fellow countrymen, Greeks, the dramatic protests of whom have been accumulating for 2-3 years now in my office and in the Committee on Petitions of which I also have the honour of being a member.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts by the Committee on Petitions to be fully enlightened by the Commission about this tragic affair and by the British government – we have held a meeting <span class="italic">in camera </span>– are not bearing fruit, at least not when it comes to informing us. Adequate answers are not being given to the questions which we have repeatedly formulated and this silence on the part of the British government, which refuses to notify its answers to the Committee on Petitions, has also been supported by the Commission. Thus, we cannot form a clear and full picture of exactly how this complex affair stands and to what extent there is responsibility by reason of negligence and/or abuse on the part of the British government as the result of delay, imperfect transposition and erroneous application of the directives on private insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The above comments, which may wrong the British government and the European Commission, do not appear to have affected either one or the other to date. The European citizens believe that their voice should be heard and it is an opportunity to restore the credibility and validity of the European Union and of our institution vis-à-vis the citizens. If we move without transparency and without account being taken of the citizens' side, then we fail as a European institution at a crucial turning point in the overall development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The role of the Committee on Petitions is to ascertain whether national and local authorities are implementing and applying EU directives properly. We are therefore obliged constantly to enter into disputes with national governments or ministries, and sometimes the European Commission also launches infringement proceedings. Obviously this is not to the advantage of the government concerned, but we are here – and that is how I understand my work in the committee – to protect the public. These Lloyd's petitions are unpleasant, not only for the former and current British governments, but also for the European Commission, which hesitated as early as 1978 to take steps against the United Kingdom. The circumstances surrounding the exchange between the Commission and the British Government on Lloyd's were very curious.</p>
<p class="contents">But just what is the so-called Lloyd's scandal? Lloyd's had recruited Names without making these people aware that it was facing huge insurance losses, mainly due to rulings in the USA on asbestos cases. The Lloyd's management then passed these losses on to the Names. As a result many lost their assets and some the only provision that they had made for their retirement. It was not only Britons that were affected but also Belgians and Germans. A few even took their own lives. Now we could say very coldly, 'Well, hard luck!' But no, these people were confident that the insurance market was regulated and that British and EU law would be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I am standing between two highly esteemed British colleagues, namely Roy Perry and Michael Cashman. I am very pleased that a compromise has been reached, but I also deeply regret the fact that this report has caused such a political upheaval. I welcome the compromise and hope that it will enable us to bring justice to the petitioners and help to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Wallis asked whether the Commission is really the Guardian of the Treaties in this case. I would like to reply to her and other Members that yes, we are, and that is the reason the Commission has sent two letters of formal notice. The Commission did not send those letters of formal notice for nothing, there were reasons for doing so. The UK Government has reacted and now, as I said earlier, the legislation is brought into line with European law. It is the duty of the Commission to ensure that this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the centre of this debate is the question as to the role of the Commission. The role of the Commission, as I have said time and again, is to see that present legislation is in line with present European law. Let me give another example that also concerns the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has instructed its customs authorities to impound quantities of alcohol and cigarettes in excess of what it thinks is reasonable for personal consumption. The Commission has judged that these actions are disproportionate to the purpose sought. Therefore the Commission has sent two letters of formal notice, the process of negotiation and discussion with the UK authorities has started and the UK authorities have brought their instructions into line with what the Commission thinks ought to be done. However, the people who have had their cars impounded have still not received any redress for the loss that they have suffered.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry and Mrs Wallis might well say that the Commission should do something about it, see to it that those who have had their cars impounded get compensation for their loss. My reply to them would be the same as my reply in this case – that is not the job of the Commission. Therefore the matter of compensation for previous losses must be left to the national judicial authorities and, as has been remarked this morning, there is now a lawsuit which has been brought before the High Court in London.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with all the sympathy I have for people who have undergone these tragic occurrences, some of whom have taken their own lives, I cannot go further than the law allows me to. Therefore, it is not true, as Mr Collins said, that the Commission is sitting on the fence. The Commission is not sitting on the fence, but it cannot go beyond the bounds of what it is allowed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I would like to say. It is not a question of David versus Goliath, as Mr Gemelli said, it is a matter of what the legal bounds of the Commission are. The Ombudsman has dealt with the matter of transparency and I have nothing more to add, except to say that the matter of the committee of inquiry is something I must leave up to Parliament. It is not for me to judge whether the circumstances are present for such a committee, nor whether the process hitherto has been correct. That I must leave in the hands of Parliament: I will respect its outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
