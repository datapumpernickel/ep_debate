<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Asselborn,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the unprecedented disaster that occurred on 26 December affected 12 countries and has claimed over 160 000 victims to date, without taking into account the thousands of missing persons, the large number of casualties and the many displaced or homeless persons, of whom there are estimated to be five million. Children who have been orphaned or separated from family members are particularly vulnerable in these circumstances. Sanitary conditions are a cause of great concern, and the extent of the material damage defies any attempt at calculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the scale of the disaster, and in close cooperation with the Dutch Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency reacted immediately after 26 December by visiting the area concerned on 1 January, along with the Commission. On the same day, the Luxembourg Minister for Health also contacted and met with officials from the WHO and the International Red Cross.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these first contacts with the United Nations and the countries affected, and following the extended emergency summit held in Jakarta, the presidency called a General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 January, which brought together a great many ministers for foreign affairs, cooperation and health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council meeting of 7 January reiterated the European Union’s solidarity with the countries affected and with their citizens, whom it thanked – and this is a very important point – for the support they gave to European citizens present in those countries at the time of the disaster. The Council also paid tribute to the general spirit of solidarity that had been demonstrated by civil society and by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council meeting provided us with an opportunity to review both the many initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States and the much-needed coordination of EU aid. We turned our joint attention to the best way of responding to the emergency in terms of financial, material and health aid, and the financial and operational resources which would be necessary and adequate for the subsequent stages of rehabilitation and reconstruction. Officials from UN agencies, namely the OCHA, the WHO and UNICEF, were invited to take part in this meeting. They provided the Council with additional information regarding the situation on the ground and the measures which had been taken, as well as an assessment of future needs. In this connection, it was stressed that the UN would play a central role in the coordination of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The main and most immediate outcomes of this Council meeting were as follows; with regard to financial issues, the Council announced that combined state aid from the European Union and the Member States for the victims of the tsunami currently stood at around EUR 1.5 billion, including both emergency aid and reconstruction aid. The Council noted, however, that this figure should not lead us to forget the general issue of development, humanitarian aid and the Millennium Development Goals, especially in Africa, nor to reduce the resources set aside for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to health issues, the Member States were invited to combine their efforts under the auspices of the WHO, in order to prevent the risk of epidemics and to put in place health infrastructures by supplying appropriate materials and medical teams. The European Union and its Member States will act in support of the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to more long-term measures, the Council expressed its hope that the European Union’s capacity to deal with major disasters would be enhanced, and stated its intention to put in place the following instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these instruments is a prevention strategy and an early-warning and rapid reaction system for disasters, particularly with a view to the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, which will be held in Kobe, in Japan, from 18 to 22 January.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, improvements will be made to the civil protection mechanism and humanitarian aid, and analytical capacity enhanced. The Council hopes to build up rapid response capabilities for the European Union by putting in place appropriate structures for planning, coordination and resource mobilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third such instrument is the stepping up of consular cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there are other measures which the Council will need to examine, such as the development of an EU rapid response capability, or in other words an early-warning system. The setting up of a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps will also need to be assessed, and coordination within the European Union in the fields of rescue, evacuation and the transport of supplies and medical aid stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">Further measures include trade support and bilateral partnerships, such as the twinning of towns and hospitals, and, finally, the rescheduling of debt servicing for affected countries wishing to embark on such rescheduling. This should be an item on the agenda of the Ecofin Council to be held next week.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council of 31 January will return to all the measures and strategies envisaged by the EU and the Member States for the medium and long term, with a view to drawing up an operational action plan for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">On the evening of 7 January, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commissioner competent for such matters, myself and the ministers responsible for health and cooperation reported back to a large delegation from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the presidency and the Commission will continue to hold an intensive dialogue with the relevant European Parliament bodies in order to implement the EU’s financial commitments, and I hope that during the General Affairs Council of 31 January we will be able to give concrete expression to some of the strategies sketched out during the General Affairs Council of 7 January.</p>

It also makes us consider the nature of national- and European-level political action aimed at dealing with the impact of natural disasters such as this one. I feel that this is an appropriate time for us to think about our instruments and our policies and about the ways in which we coordinate our efforts and in which we share responsibilities among national authorities and European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My trip to Jakarta last week gave me some sense of the actual scale of the tragedy caused by this earthquake and the tsunami that followed. The trip also confirmed to me that the international community, including the EU and the Commission, was capable of responding swiftly by raising substantial amounts of money and providing other forms of support.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel was shocked by what he saw when he was in the area. The giant wave completely swept away any human presence along 500 kilometres of coastline, destroying everything in its path and reaching places more than five kilometres inland. The biggest tragedy is that most of the population lived on the very coastal strip that was completely devastated. Similarly alarming stories have reached us from Sri Lanka, Thailand, India and the Maldives and the havoc caused in other, less accessible, countries, is only now coming to light. The tragedy also reached as far as the coast of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">This enormous natural disaster has left 150 000 dead in its wake, and more than 5 million people homeless and traumatised, who now have to face the challenge of picking up what remains of their devastated families, rebuilding their homes, restoring economic activities and, in short, trying to start their lives again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The scale of the disaster and the shocking images plastered on our televisions and newspapers sparked massive sympathy among our European citizens, who widely demanded a very quick and large-scale response. We should be proud of the European response. Europeans have provided a massive demonstration of solidarity, at the level of institutions and at the level of individual citizens. Overall European support for the victims and countries affected is by far the most important worldwide: Europe was the first donor to announce direct assistance; European representatives were among the first on the ground. I want to praise all of those directly and indirectly involved in this enormous effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the management of the crisis, I want to highlight the excellent cooperation between the Commission and the Council presidency, in particular the cooperation of Prime Minister Juncker, and the European Parliament. We have shown how crucial it is to ensure sound and effective interinstitutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In other emergency situations the Commission has had more time to discuss and prepare its response beforehand with Parliament and the Council, our budgetary authorities. In this case, we did not have that time. Within nine days of the waves striking the coastlines of Asia and Africa, the heads of government from the affected countries and the major donors were gathering in Jakarta to agree on how we would repair the damage and what funds we would make available.</p>
<p class="contents">To prepare the ground within the limited time that we had, I discussed with President Borrell Fontelles and Prime Minister Juncker, before leaving for Jakarta, the Commission's proposal to pledge up to EUR 450 million. They were both very positive and supportive of the approach I proposed. Indeed, at the conference in Jakarta I mentioned a special message that President Borrell Fontelles sent me and asked me to transmit to the heads of state and government gathered there.</p>
<p class="contents">Without having had an opportunity for detailed discussion in Parliament's plenary and the Council, I indicated to the pledging conference in Jakarta that the Commission's EUR 450 million pledge was conditional on its approval by the budgetary authorities and that includes you, the European Parliament. The Commission's priority today is to listen to your views, answer your questions and agree on how we can best tackle the two main tasks we now face, namely how to turn our conditional pledge rapidly into concrete money on the budget, and then to turn those funds into effective reconstruction programmes on the ground that will help people rebuild their shattered lives.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is still early days, I should like to explain in more detail what I have in mind as to how best to use the Commission's pledge, if you and the Council agree to the funding that we have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the humanitarian side, the Commission has responded rapidly and very efficiently. Through our humanitarian assistance office, ECHO, we were one of the first organisations to respond to the disaster by making – EUR 23 million available – EUR 3 million of which were available on the day of the disaster itself – in humanitarian aid to the Red Cross and other partners for meeting essential needs. We reinforced ECHO staff on the ground, and our experts have been working closely with the United Nations and other donors to assess needs and ensure the coordination of the humanitarian aid effort on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel travelled to the most affected areas from 1 to 7 January to gather a first-hand impression and gauge needs for relief and rehabilitation. We have also been quick in mobilising civil protection. The European Civil Protection Mechanism, under the responsibility of Commissioner Dimas, has been active since the very first reports of the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the disaster, the European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre has operated around the clock to mobilise and coordinate civil protection assistance from European Union Member States and neighbouring countries. The mechanism has proved to be a simple and efficient system that allows the targeting of assistance to the specific needs of each affected country. Within 24 hours of the disaster, the Centre sent assessment and coordination experts to Thailand and Sri Lanka. As Mr Kofi Annan has underlined, USD 1 billion will be needed immediately. In answer to this, I proposed, as part of the pledge, that another EUR 100 million be allocated from the emergency reserve to provide humanitarian assistance. I understand your committees have been discussing this proposal favourably and Commissioner Michel indicated our commitment at the United Nation's pledging conference held in Geneva yesterday. This also shows our full support for Parliament's approach of underlining the coordination role of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the reconstruction side, I proposed that EUR 350 million be made available. I envisage that part of this will come from fresh funds and part from a reprogramming of funds already planned for the affected countries. Although the reconstruction task will take several years, the financing of this reconstruction effort should be provided this year and next year. I understand that the word 'reprogramming' has caused some concern in Parliament. So why is the Commission proposing this? The main reason is speed. The funds for projects planned for 2005 are already on the table and can be used for the urgent and immediate reconstruction work. Waiting for fresh funds to come on stream will take up to six months. We need to move with reconstruction funds now. All donors are responding in the same way, including the World Bank, to mobilise funds for the tsunami relief project as fast as possible. Moreover, I do not believe this approach will have any negative side effects.</p>
<p class="contents">We may ask whether this will lead to a cancellation of projects already planned. The answer is no. If, like us, the governments decide that the tsunami-related project takes immediate priority, the originally-planned projects can be taken up in 2006 or 2007 under the new financial perspective; in some cases, the problem is that we cannot go on with the previous project for those regions because the tsunami has affected those regions, so we have to give priority to the tsunami-related projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Will this lead to Asia robbing other regions of their funds? The answer is no. Any projects that may be reprioritised and delayed in this way will be within the Asia envelope which, if necessary, will have to be readapted. I count on your support in this regard. Having seen the European Parliament's draft resolution, I can assure you that the 'poor across the world will not pay the price of this disaster'.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding cooperation development aid, the priority of the European Union clearly is, and will continue to be, Africa, on account of its structural needs, of which you are all aware. But this does not mean that we cannot proceed now by giving direct priority to the relief for this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you some specific examples of how this reprogramming approach can be of immediate value. In Indonesia, the Commission has a EUR 35 million programme which aims to improve access and quality of healthcare at community level. If the government of Indonesia agrees, this can be extended quickly to help rebuild and strengthen healthcare facilities damaged by the tsunami. In Sri Lanka we are planning to cooperate with the World Bank on a housing programme to assist the resettlement of internally-displaced persons. Similarly, this programme could be broadened quickly to assist with the rehousing of families displaced by the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the level of new funding, I stress that the Commission needs to look at how planned projects can be reprogrammed in this way to ensure that we can respond to reconstruction within the critical first months. But the Commission's pledge was provisional and could be revisited once final costings have been made. We already know that needs are huge and there could be room for an even higher contribution of fresh funds if both Parliament and the Council agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the line agreed in Jakarta that the countries must conduct assessments of need and create their own national tsunami reconstruction plans. That would identify the priority projects and the means to implement them. It is a matter of basic principle: allowing the countries to assume their own responsibility and ensuring that they coordinate all the generous commitments made. We should not flood the countries with hundreds of different facilities and instruments drawn up beforehand with donors or international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at another principle that all donors and countries agreed in Jakarta: to deliver our support rapidly. I emphasised in Jakarta that the Commission would seek to explore all means at its disposal to turn its plans into effective programmes as quickly as possible. The General Affairs Council further lent its support to this commitment. This means accelerating our procedures as much as possible within the confines of the Financial Regulation so that unnecessarily heavy bureaucracy does not slow us down.</p>
<p class="contents">I saw how rapidly and efficiently the countries have already moved in helping their citizens. It is impressive! As such, we should provide the bulk of our aid as budget support, giving the countries the tools to rebuild their destroyed infrastructure and to restore the livelihoods of their shattered communities. This approach is the only way in which the affected countries can coordinate the aid efficiently. It would be an impossible task for them if the hundreds of donors gave their aid separately and all demanded that their own procedures be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, budget support must be properly supervised if we are to have the comfort of sound financial management of our funds. To this end, I support the initiative of the World Bank and the other international financial institutions to develop trust funds with the countries concerned, effectively creating a common pot into which donors can put funds along with a common set of rules for implementing, monitoring and auditing, which will guide the management of the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also need to address punctual and particular projects that will be better delivered by direct implementation rather than by passing through the national budgets. For example, some specific work may be started in the humanitarian phase that could usefully be continued under the initial reconstruction phase. Alternatively, there may be specific conditions that prevent easy access for the national budget to certain geographical regions or, indeed, to the poorest communities who must benefit from this reconstruction. Such cases would also warrant the continued channelling of part of our funds through NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has been active from day one on all fronts, from humanitarian aid to civil protection and, increasingly so, to rehabilitation and reconstruction. We will pursue our efforts relentlessly. However, we will also reflect on improvements, new ideas and solutions. We will reply to the Council's requests for proposals and put forward innovative tools. In doing so, our main concern will be to find solutions that provide effectiveness and good use of available capacities in the Member States and European institutions, optimising means and technologies at European level. Creating new structures for the sake of it is not an option; making better use of the vast existing European capacity in a coordinated and articulated manner is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be particularly attentive to the European dimension of our initiatives and will be keen to make it more visible to the general public and to the beneficiaries. Solidarity is a trademark of the European Union. Let it be experienced also in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise the importance Parliament places on additional measures beyond aid that the European Union can provide further to help the countries affected by the tsunami. You can rest assured that all Commission departments are mobilised in their particular areas to investigate what can be done in this regard. This includes support for the G8 debt moratorium initiatives, the investigation of possible trade initiatives to ease trade access to the Union for the countries concerned and working with the governments to seek to facilitate the implementation of the European Investment Bank's Indian Ocean Tsunami Facility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and Commission agreed in the General Affairs Council to offer direct support to the countries in their efforts to develop early-warning systems so they will be better able to respond to future disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted with interest the ideas being floated on the possibility of supplying fishing vessels from the Commission, that is to say, European Union fleets to the fishing communities in the affected countries. The idea is very appealing. We have all seen pictures of boats wrecked by the tsunami, and our own fishing industry is about to destroy boats from its own fleet in line with fishery limits.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My services are currently exploring whether vessels are available, what state of repair they are in, if they meet the need of the fishing communities in the tsunami-affected areas, and how they could be made available to these fishermen. I hope that this initiative will work and we will report back to you with the results of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also considering proposals for a new European Union approach to reinforce capacity for disaster prevention and, as discussed in the extraordinary Council meeting last Friday, we intend to look at early-warning mechanisms and preparation for disaster management, the ways to further improve the Commission's humanitarian aid provision, and civil protection, with a view to developing our rapid response to crises in third countries in full respect of the specificity and principles of humanitarian aid. In this context, the Commission is preparing a proposal for the development of a rapid response capacity of the European Union, which will permit it to enhance its assistance in future humanitarian disasters and other crises. We expect to present that proposal at the Council meeting on 31 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In every successful emergency programme organised by the Commission, Parliament has played a pivotal role. In this regard, I think of Afghanistan or the Balkans. This role is not simply to agree on funding, but to follow the programme and to lend political weight where needed to ensure that the programme's political goals remain on track. Your attention could also focus on the administrative resources – in headquarters and in delegations – necessary for effective delivery. I am confident that you will play an important role in facilitating the Commission's programme of reconstruction after the tsunami. To this end, I will undertake that the Commission will report to you regularly on progress, both in plenary and in committees.</p>
<p class="contents">The College had an extensive discussion yesterday on the Asian crisis and on how we should organise our follow-up to the work done so far. By the end of this month, I expect to present Commission proposals for an improved European crisis response capability. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will go to the region in the coming weeks to further assess needs and to put more flesh on this proposal. I will propose that she report to Parliament on her return.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set high targets for the European Union's response to the South Asian crisis, both in Jakarta and in United Nations meetings in Geneva. The outpouring of support from our private citizens for this crisis further shows their support for the full commitment of all European Union institutions to deliver on the promises we have made. We must provide answers and I count on your support in helping the Commission to deliver. I give you my promise to work closely with you in the massive task ahead of us.</p>

As a Sri Lankan-born Member of this Parliament, I wish to express my gratitude to all those who have responded so generously to appeals, and especially for the help given by the peoples of Europe; my own country, Britain, in particular; and my constituents in the south-east of England.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States have together pledged almost EUR 1.5 billion so far. The amount continues to rise. The Commission and Parliament have sanctioned EUR 23 million and promised funds of EUR 350 million, although EUR 150 million of that is not new money, but will be taken from existing long-term developments. This must be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the proposal for a lending facility of EUR 1 billion from the European Investment Bank. We must deliver the aid which we have promised. In the past the international community has not done so. A rapid reaction civilian corps for aid delivery, as proposed by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, is most welcome. Our aid must be visible.</p>
<p class="contents">I was embarrassed in Sri Lanka because EU aid was immediately delivered, but was done so invisibly, despite Commissioner Michel being extremely visible and hands-on. The United Nations and NGOs only act as coordinators and do not pretend to be the donors. Our taxpayers demand visibility. Ownership matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that aid is not stolen – yes, stolen! Where the appropriate systems do not exist in the recipient countries, aid will be stolen unless we ensure that delivery mechanisms are totally transparent and accountable. There is currently an urgent need for small, suitable boats to be donated. I am glad that President Barroso mentioned that.</p>
<p class="contents">Early warning procedures are also needed before the next disaster happens. An authenticated telephone call to CNN and the other broadcast networks could have saved thousands of lives in Sri Lanka, Somalia and Thailand. After all, the Americans evacuated Diego Garcia. However, that telephone call did not come. This does not only apply to Asia. How would people in Europe be warned if, let us say, volcanic activity in the Canary Islands caused a tsunami? Will the Commission prepare an urgent report?</p>
<p class="contents">In Sri Lanka I hope that reconstruction will also mean reconciliation and that aid will be consistent with the December 2002 Oslo talks and the Tokyo Donor Conference expectations. We should expect no less for Indonesia, with its Aceh separatists.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that it is trade and investment, not aid, which will sustain the people in the long term. The devastation is limited to the coastal areas and the countries of south Asia are still open for business.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us all work together, not only to repair the destruction, but also to give the victims a hand up and not merely a hand-out.</p>

Both the Commission and the Council have described the essential steps that have to be taken. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament can say that we endorse all these initiatives, and that this House must grant all the financial and organisational support that is needed. I think everyone – including Mr Deva, who has just spoken – has made it clear that, as far as Parliament is concerned, both the economic resources and the organisational measures are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore limit myself to making a few basic observations on this disaster, which has made it apparent that we live in a global village and that the solidarity that is self-evidently necessary in the world in which we live must be supranational in character. That is why it is important that we revisit, and establish in our own minds, the decisive importance of the role played by the EU itself alongside the Member States, for it is in the European Union that Europeans’ willingness to join in supranational action manifests itself, and that this international action organised under the European Union’s aegis results in action being taken across continents is a necessary consequence of the fact that a disaster of this kind knows no geographical limit to its impact, afflicting not only the people who live where it strikes, but also people from every country, including from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">New forms of organisation are thus called for, and they are coming into being. One of them has been proposed by the Commission: the combination of a rapid-response unit, rapid-response forces, and technical expertise, organised under the leadership of the European Union. That is an intelligent proposal and one that is deserving of support. It has been proposed that financial instruments be organised alongside those of the nation states, and that is something we cannot do without, but it is equally clear that people like Europeans, from a highly mobile society, cannot do without consular help in such a situation. So it is that the development of a joint consular system, potentially paving the way for a shared diplomatic service, is something good to come out of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of a concluding comment, let me say that, in amidst the flood of information I have received over the past few days, there is one outstanding piece of news. A few months ago, in this House, we commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in Beslan. I learned this morning that the people of Beslan have collected a million roubles – amounting to EUR 30 000 – as an expression of solidarity with the tsunami’s victims. In a situation like theirs, there can be no greater example of humane conduct, of solidarity, indeed of human greatness. I think we should take this opportunity to express our utmost respect for the people of Beslan, who have themselves been victims.</p>

It provides an opportunity to reassert the role and the benefit of multilateral action through the United Nations, but also a challenge to the United Nations to prove itself up to the task. Thus far, its response has been promising. The response of the European Union, too, has put us on to a good start, and I salute the prompt action of Commissioner Michel and the support that his colleagues gave.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union aid, both public and private, has been impressive in its generosity. ECHO funds were released rapidly in the aftermath of the disaster. Total pledges now amount to EUR 540 million, plus a EUR 1 billion lending facility. Though, to be honest, one-third of that grant aid is reprogrammed from existing development aid for the region. Let us make sure that these pledges are honoured – only two per cent of the USD 1 billion pledged to the reconstruction of the Iranian city of Bam after the earthquake there has been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not be complacent, for the present ECHO can act as a financier. In the longer term we must have the potential to send troops, ships, floating hospitals and helicopters to assist in disaster relief. More than 150 000 people have lost their lives, whole communities have been wiped out. Five million more people are injured or have lost their homes, livelihoods or families. Many are children at risk of falling prey to child traffickers and others. Goodwill abroad notwithstanding, children from those devastated communities should not be removed from the societies and traditions that they know. Unicef and others must act swiftly to provide the shelter, protection and registration that those children need if they are to rebuild their lives and perhaps, eventually, be traced by relatives.</p>
<p class="contents">This tragedy has called forth a major response in donations from individuals a world away, to families of victims they have never met, yet wish to help, reminding us how small our global community is. Let us build on this opportunity to set aside our differences. The stricken countries will pay more this year in trade tariffs than we will grant them in aid. That should give us cause for reflection on our trading policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We need close monitoring of the aid to make sure it is not used to fuel regional conflicts and is not diverted by corrupt local officials. Let us have a scoreboard for EU reconstruction efforts, just as the United Nations must have a tracking system for aid channelled through its agencies. And let the Commission extend its lead in coordinating the Union's response. If each Member State contributed an expert in humanitarian aid to ECHO, a central resource would exist with expertise in the response capacity of different national facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one clear lesson from this is our frailty in the face of the forces of nature. We cannot tame them, but we can collectively mitigate their devastation. We have the technology to detect earthquakes in the world's danger spots. Providing it to regions at risk can be achieved at modest expense and perhaps save hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to say that my group supports the proposal presented by the Commission and the Council to enhance the European Union’s civilian intervention capacities. This disaster has shown us that, although much-needed, national interventions alone were unable to respond to a disaster of such magnitude. It also showed that civilian intervention capacities should cover not only humanitarian civilian intervention but also political civilian intervention, or in other words intervention in support of conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot intervene in Indonesia without intervening in the conflict which is taking place there, and we cannot help Sri Lanka without intervening in the military conflict which is going on there. Intervention in support of conflict prevention and humanitarian intervention are intimately linked, and we support the Commission’s views on this matter. I should like to suggest to other Members that the money they receive for this sitting should be donated to help the victims of the disaster.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Barroso has tried to carry out a sleight of hand, but he is not a good conjurer. The word ‘reprogramming’ means using funds that had already been allocated to aid, and so I call for all the EUR 350 million for the first stage of reconstruction to be a new appropriation and for the total of EUR 1.5 billion that is to be paid out by the European Union and the 25 Member States to be donated without any kind of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard calls in this Chamber to take account of the foreign debt of the countries affected by the tsunami. I believe we should state clearly that the only practicable possibility is to cancel their foreign debt. We are talking about countries like Indonesia, which has more than USD 130 billion in debts and repaid USD 13 billion in 2002. Given figures like those, our donations cannot provide any practical aid unless we cancel the debt.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not yet heard anybody mention an attempt to change the immigration rules, at least temporarily: I refer to the possibility for immigrants from the affected nations who are already living in Europe to be able to return home, see the situation for themselves, look for their loved ones and then be able to come back to the Union, without running the risk of losing their residence permit or job. I also refer to the possibility of offering residence permits, at least temporary ones, to all those who have been hurt during this tragedy.</p>

<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must examine in depth what is happening in our area. Here, the Commission is cutting money from earthquake research and giving it to space research. However, if a similar earthquake occurred here, in the Mediterranean, the tsunami would reach the Alps and would flatten Greece, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, France, Spain and other countries. We therefore need to look at what we can do in this direction. Let the misfortune of south-east Asia be a lesson. As Hippocrates said 2 500 years ago, prevention is better than cure, and that makes sense. However, I do not know if there is any sense in the people at the Commission who are cutting money for earthquake research and giving it to space research. Let us do something in our own area, before it all ends in tears here too.</p>

<p class="contents">The events of recent days should make us give the matter serious consideration: Europe with its 25 Member States, its almost half a billion people and its single currency just looked on, stunned, dismayed and impotent, while the peoples that had been affected called out for immediate, practical and effective aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Where was the European civil protection mentioned in the action plan drawn up in 1999? What did the European Monitoring Centre achieve? Where was the civil protection task force set up by the Council of the European Union in October 2001 precisely to guarantee rapid intervention even outside Europe? Why did the Commission decide to leave the 300 experts in the European task force at home during the tsunami disaster after training and preparing them for years?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps now is not the time for polemics, but it should at least be put on record – as we have been demanding for the last three years – that what Europe needs is not coordination and pooling of resources, but a civil protection agency, an autonomous body that is versatile and thus able to anticipate needs and take action when and where it is required. That is what Parliament should be proposing, starting with tomorrow’s resolution, if we do not want to carry on pretending that nothing has happened or thinking that solidarity is just an empty promise.</p>
