<p class="contents">The first of these was that they should revisit their own decisions and ensure that these decisions are implemented. The second was that they should abide by the institutional rules. It is a sad state of affairs when the members of a community must be reminded of such self-evident rules of conduct, and when appeals must be made to those in positions of responsibility to abide by them. Unfortunately, the appeals fell on deaf ears in the case of too many Heads of State or Government. For many years now, the euro zone finance ministers have also ignored these principles, even though they are necessary for formulating efficient, confidence-building and professional policies. Those who infringed the Stability and Growth Pact have even set themselves up in judgment and prevented the Commission from enforcing the rights conferred upon it. The same happened to Parliament when it considered the two draft Commission regulations on the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission called on the finance ministers to incorporate Parliament’s proposals; the President-in-Office of the Council called on his colleagues to take heed of them. During the last part-session, a majority of Members of this House voted in favour of both my reports on the two Commission regulations. Yet, even though the majority of finance ministers, the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council agreed on the substance of our new amendments, not one of them was accepted by the Council. Most of the national delegations would have been prepared to incorporate certain amendments, in particular those relating to total debt evolution and monitoring, but a small number of influential countries stood in the way of this happening. Attempts are now being made to pass the buck to Parliament, by telling us that although no one is going to ask us what we want, we have no power to stop anything from happening. This is not a matter of institutional competence; it is a matter of substance. In its statement on the ECOFIN decision, the Commission said that in its opinion, the draft regulation would have been further strengthened had some of Parliament’s amendments been incorporated, in particular those relating to debt monitoring. This is a sign that Parliament is heading in the right direction, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore decided to resubmit the amendments adopted at first reading. Our reasons for this are as follows; we are convinced that the substance of these amendments is appropriate, and we do not want the other EU institutions to disregard institutional rights and opinions on matters of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we want? We want a comparison between the data supplied by the Member States to the ECB and that supplied to Eurostat. The Council has stated that comparisons of this kind are already being carried out, but this begs the question of why no one noticed the discrepancies in the figures reported by Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want the medium-term budgetary objectives to be reviewed, and not ‘at least every four years’, as the Council has now proposed, but on a regular basis, as per our original proposals. We want public debt monitoring, of which there is no mention in the regulation, even though the Council agreed to it in March. We want stability programmes to be submitted annually for a two-year period; yet again, this proposal was rejected. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is not in fact a dispute over points of substance; the simple truth of the matter is that the Council did not wish to accept any of Parliament’s amendments. An attitude of this kind hardly inspires confidence, and it is not only unwarranted from a factual point of view, but also unfair in institutional terms. I would therefore ask the House to vote tomorrow at second reading in the same way it did at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission indicated the need and the main avenues for improving the functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact in its communication of 3 September 2004. After several rounds of discussion, the Ecofin Council met again on 20 March, reached agreement and adopted its report on improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. On 22 March 2005, the European Council endorsed the report stating that it updates and complements the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the report is to enhance governance and the national ownership of the EU fiscal framework by strengthening its economic underpinning, while safeguarding the sustainability of public finances and promoting growth. We hold the view that, overall, the agreement is balanced and provides an appropriate basis for restoring national ownership of the fiscal framework. If fully implemented it has the prospect of reinforcing fiscal discipline and growth support of fiscal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 April 2005, the earliest possible date following the agreement, the Commission adopted the two proposals amending the two Council Regulations – (EC) No 1466/97 and (EC) No 1467/97 – which underpin the pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council have immediately begun discussing the Commission proposals in a constructive spirit. All parties strove to bring the process to a successful conclusion swiftly. I would like to express the Commission’s gratitude, in particular to the Parliament for its cooperative attitude, thereby making it possible to finalise the amendment procedure during the Luxembourg presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this month, the Parliament adopted at first reading a number of amendments to the Commission proposals. The Council, taking account of Parliament’s opinion, agreed on its common position shortly thereafter. In its position however, Council could not agree on taking on board any of the amendments proposed by the Parliament. Nevertheless, the changes adopted by the Council with respect to the Commission proposal go in the direction of further clarifying the implementation of the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact in line with the overall thrust of the amendments tabled by Parliament. Other changes envisaged by Parliament, namely those in the statistical field, have been considered by the Council in the finalisation of the legal acts directly linked to the statistics of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Commission, the inclusion of some of the amendments tabled by Parliament could have strengthened the proposed regulation further. However, after careful consideration, the Commission decided to accept the Council common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the revisions made to the Stability and Growth Pact are balanced; they will give the pact a new vigour and provide a better framework for an economically sensible implementation of the rules. The Commission is committed to a balanced and rigorous implementation of the reformed pact. It continues to closely monitor the budgeting situation in all Member States. It will use its right of initiative where appropriate, as it has done in recent days. As you know, the Commission decided to initiate excessive deficit procedures for Italy and Portugal. We expect the procedures to be seen as a means of supporting the fiscal consolidation needed in both countries to return to high economic growth. A cooperative approach to ensure the smooth implementation of the excessive deficit procedure will contribute to the credibility of the renewed framework and of the overall functioning of EMU in this challenging period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Pact is being quietly laid to rest, well away from the public eye. Be that as it may, I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report, and for his attempt to formulate a position for Parliament that reconciles the views of the Council and the Commission. In my opinion, it says a lot that the Council can reach agreement on a further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact at a time like this, when it cannot agree on a single important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all taking place at a time when the euro needs a stable framework and when our key objective should be to avoid running up debts and thereby increasing inflation. Above all, it is a time when the Commission’s position must be strengthened. I therefore find it equally regrettable that the Commission has given its consent, as this means that nothing has been done about the Pact’s underlying problem, which is that those who violate it sit in judgment on themselves. The Council should have given its backing to attempts to flesh out somewhat the details of how its own decisions are to be monitored and interpreted, and the Commission should have supported such attempts accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first infringement proceedings against Italy will now make clear what approach the Commission services favour. All we can do is encourage them to continue the fight to achieve a solid framework for the euro and for the Pact governing the euro, which is our common currency, even if this means coming out in opposition to the Member States. Members of the previous Commission were prepared to do just that, and I would encourage you to continue fighting for the Pact and for the spirit that it formerly embodied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it was set up in Maastricht, there were still inspired and visionary Europeans on the scene. Jacques Delors was one of them. His objective with regard to monetary union was twofold: to stabilise exchange rates and the development of inflation, and to bring closer a political Union in which Europe’s citizens would be guaranteed prosperity and welfare. We managed to achieve the first part of the objective beautifully. We have a stable euro that has withstood major currency crises and inflation that is so low that it has now again given economists something to worry about. As far as the second aspect, political Union, is concerned, though, we seem to be further removed from it than ever these days, although crises sometimes give rise to surprising leaps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States that exchanged their national currencies for the common euro without committing to a further political Union and starting one macro-economic and budget policy needed guarantees to prevent one Member State’s frugality from being undermined by another’s irresponsible overspending. They did not want to encroach too much on each other’s territory in terms of political choices for budgetary policy, and that is how the Stability and Growth Pact with its system of sanctions, came about; it was, in other words, a pact based on distrust. The pact prescribed quantitative standards for, among others, the net result of annual government budgets and for the level of public debt. That worked at the end of the last century, but the economic situation of the past few years has made these rules appear too rigid. So, on a purely rational basis, it was logical and sensible to change them and to give due priority, once again, to this objective of stability and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, a number of large Member States got into difficulty and resisted interference from the Commission and the sanctions of their fellow finance ministers. Consequently, the Commission’s appropriate adjustment to make the pact more intelligent coincided with a battle for prestige among the Member States. Commissioner Almunia concentrated his efforts on sensible reform, but the eco-feminists wanted, above all, to create room for their own excuse to break the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This has therefore been the subject of much heated debate and, in general, most criticism has been levelled at the latter. For example, the European Central Bank was very negative about this corrective aspect but was able to endorse the pact’s preventive section, while taking into account such factors as economic trends and long-term debt. That storm abated. The pact itself has not changed, but an estimate of those budgets is now available to us. The strange thing is that we have now adopted this regulation on this controversial corrective section, that this only falls within the scope of an advisory procedure and that this has now entered into effect since last time’s vote, but that we now have a regulation at second reading on this other, preventive section. I will leave this to one side for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a number of amendments to this regulation have therefore been adopted, but, as a qualified majority is required for those amendments to be adopted, the upshot could be that this regulation will not enter into force. I would therefore counsel against this, and advise this House to accept the situation as it is, as the Commission was sensible enough to do, for both regulations – the second of which we regard as more important than the first – can enter into force simultaneously. Mr Juncker has had a tough time lately, and we should at least let him have this success and result during the Luxembourg Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider several of the reservations and objections from the European Council to be superficial and insufficiently thought through or justified. Due to lack of time, I would like to touch upon just two of the points contained in the Council’s comments on Article 6 paragraph 1 and Article 7 paragraph 2(a).</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Article 6 paragraph 1, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference between reporting and monitoring the absolute value of the surplus or deficit in public finances, and the level of overall public finance debt as a percentage of the preset basis, for example, gross domestic product, which has a substantially higher information value from the viewpoint of maintaining budgetary prudence than absolute data on the level of deficit. I therefore support the position of the European Parliament submitted by Mr Karas in this and other points.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above the position of the European Parliament, I would like to question the wording of Article 7 paragraph 2(a) and how it has been amended by the European Council, where the deviation from the medium-term budget targets in connection with multi-pillar pensions reform has been permitted. This may only be applied if the costs of pensions reform will demonstrably be addressed at the expense of lower final consumption or increased savings by citizens, and not the short- or medium-term coverage of pension deficits by one-off and unrepeatable receipts from privatisations, as it happens at present in several European Union countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At times such as these, when reforms of the Institutions are being carried out, as in the case of the Stability Pact, it is important that all the institutions of the European Union are present and that they participate in those institutional reforms, in order to give them more credibility and in order to communicate to the European citizens, at the end of the day, that those reforms are aimed at producing economic growth and creating employment. That has been the purpose of this European Parliament action: a clearly constructive purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us are very critical of the Spring Council; we believe that the Pact should not have been reformed in the way it was. Despite this, however, we have presented constructive initiatives in order to supplement no less than the preventive aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact, and it is therefore absurd that the Council should dig its heels in and not allow a European Parliament initiative of a constructive nature which is intended to make the Stability Pact more reliable and more credible.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that this situation will change, that tomorrow the European Parliament will express its support for these amendments and act consistently and, also, that the intransigence of the Council will be overcome, after ascertaining the situation and the causes of the difficult crisis we are experiencing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner, who is here today, is well aware that the budget surplus — what a budget surplus you achieved when you were responsible for finance in Ireland, Mr McCreevy ... it makes us jealous... — is well aware that the quality of public finances makes a contribution to confidence when it comes to promoting economic growth and job creation; that is what the European Union needs at the moment and that is what we aspire to.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking Mr Karas, who has done a commendable job, for his attitude and his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue before us is whether, on the one hand, we accept a proposal that is to my mind relatively well balanced and thereby succeed in adopting this balanced proposal before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency, or, on the other hand, we find a way of postponing the process and possibly leading it down a blind alley through a succession of amendments. I therefore feel that, rather than appealing to the Members of this House, who might block the adoption of this common position, our overriding priorities should be common sense and the need to take this process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the Council adopted a motion in March to amend the Stability and Growth Pact and its two pillars. Although this is not a position that I myself welcome, it is clearly a step in the right direction, towards smoothing relations between the EU and the citizens, whose concerns have not been met on any practical level by the economic governance of Europe. It is on this basis that we have to work. The issue before us is not, of course, the sustainability of public finances and, less still, their consolidation. Our priority is rather to make the Pact more effective and easier for society as a whole to understand. I therefore urge common sense so that we can take this process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the European Central Bank (ECB) finally appears willing to adopt more growth-friendly monetary policies. It is said that interest rates are set to fall. At a time when the ECB is ready to break free from its orthodoxy, now does not strike me as the right time for Parliament to cling stubbornly to its financial orthodoxy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, as I said in my introductory remarks, the Council did not take our advice on board. Against this background I can understand the position of the House with regard to some of its initial amendments. However, as I stated earlier, I think the common position is generally acceptable; it is broadly balanced and contains the essential elements initially proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Also against the background of the spreading scepticism surrounding the European project, it is important to demonstrate interinstitutional cohesion regarding this important reform project. Your agreement with the Council’s common position would help reinforce the pact’s credibility and political support, sending out a clear message of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me reassure you again that the Commission is firmly committed to implementing the pact rigorously and even-handedly. The adoption of the reformed pact will help maintain and enforce the solid basis on which that is done. We would like the European Parliament to join the Commission in encouraging Member States to pursue macro-economic stability. The Commission is committed to informing Parliament regularly about relevant developments in budgetary surveillance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
