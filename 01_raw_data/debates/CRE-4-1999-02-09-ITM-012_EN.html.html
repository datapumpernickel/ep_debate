<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Baldi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a directive is designed to replace, expand and revise Directive 88/379/EEC, in an effort to harmonise the rules on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations placed on the European market. It therefore facilitates free movement and seeks to avoid creating obstacles to trade, at the same time guaranteeing a high level of protection for human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">On 26 June 1997, the European Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading, adopting 26 amendments. Subsequently, on 23 September 1997, the Commission tabled an amended proposal and, on 24 September 1998, the Council unanimously adopted its common position, taking on board 12 amendments unchanged, accepting two in principle and rejecting 12.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this second reading takes up the fundamental points approved at first reading, we also have a range of new and interesting elements, such as the specific reference to animal welfare and the obligation to use suitable alternatives to animal testing whenever possible; there is also the extension of hazard classification and labelling requirements to cover pesticides, with the label specifically stating: ‘To avoid risks to man and the environment, comply with the instructions for use". Furthermore, a clearer and less complicated procedure is provided for requesting confidentiality for harmful and irritant substances, allowing the industry to protect its own know‐how and thus remain competitive on the global market, while at the same time guaranteeing a high level of protection for consumers. The proposal also requires safety data sheets to be provided, and this requirement must therefore be extended to cover non‐classified preparations, such as for instance industrial detergents containing substances dangerous to the environment. This is an important point, because the safety data sheets are mainly of use to specific users and experts in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandatory information on the label also applies in the case of preparations containing at least one substance classified as sensitising, present in concentrations equal to or in excess of 0.1 % That limit, lower than in the past, means that the preparation will have to be labelled, bearing a warning for individuals who may be sensitive to it. Finally, we have the introduction of transitional arrangements for Finland, Sweden and Austria, which had pointed out at first reading that they would have problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention has thus been to rationalise and harmonise the existing legislation in relation to chemical substances, and even though those not directly involved may find the proposal hard to understand, we do need to be aware of the role of this House. I any event, the danger a product presents is assessed by determining its characteristics by reference to its physical and chemical properties, those of its properties that have effects on health, and those that affect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to the House that, as compared with the 1988 proposal, this proposal introduces changes designed to extend the scope of the directive in relation to dangerous preparations to the following five new sectors: classification and labelling in terms of environmental risks, plant health products and biocides, non‐classified dangerous preparations, explosives and the labelling of some sensitising substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought it appropriate to retable at second reading three of the 12 amendments rejected by the Council. Those amendments, which were unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on 20 January this year, are: Amendment No 1 concerning comitology, the intention of which was to restate a fundamental principle of the European Parliament. In this instance, we refer to consultation of a type A committee, made up therefore of one representative per Member State and chaired by a Commission representative, which is able to adopt the proposed measures should the Council fail to respond, subject to consultation. Type B committees cannot adopt any measure without the Council's agreement. I have retabled Amendment No 2 concerning the possibility of using tests already in existence to assess possible risks to the environment, thus making it unnecessary to develop further methods; and finally, there is Amendment No 3 which simplifies the text of the information given on the label of preparations containing sensitising substances.</p>
<p class="contents">If the House adopts these amendments, since the directive is based on Article 100a, we shall have to appoint a delegation from the European Parliament as soon as possible to take part in the conciliation committee, in accordance with Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that the work which has been done to achieve the widest possible degree of consensus has been particularly demanding and exhausting, but I believe it is crucial to draw up a directive that takes account of the health of consumers, the different laws of the Member States and the needs of manufacturers of dangerous products. The labelling of dangerous substances and preparations is thus a vital way of ensuring that easily comprehensible information on the dangers of the product is provided faster. Consumers must be protected when purchasing and using certain products by giving them clear, accurate and simple information which sets out the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this report is to group together in a single act all the existing Community legislation on dangerous preparations, and it concerns hundreds of thousands of products, destined both for European consumers and more specialised operators. If this new labelling is approved, and this also involves classification and packaging in the light of the potential danger, it will be easier to recognise and use any kind of product in the most appropriate way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hulthén </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, it is once again time for us to discuss important health and environmental questions at an hour that is scarcely popular either with those responsible for the report or us who are involved in the debate. It is a remarkable coincidence that in Strasbourg environmental work always seems to take place on Tuesday nights.</p>
<p class="contents">In every other way, the report we are discussing tonight is very important. It concerns many citizens of the European Union, since it deals with the classification and labelling of dangerous preparations. The topic is particularly relevant for Finland, Sweden and Austria, for whom the problem of regulating chemicals was a matter of concern in their membership negotiations. Transitional arrangements were made for all three countries allowing them to retain for a time their own legislation on chemical preparations, which was more stringent than that in force in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive. The position adopted by the rapporteur and then by the Commission was, in my view, far too lenient, bearing in mind the dangers associated with chemicals. Consequently, we had a fairly intensive discussion on the subject at first reading and, as a result, the outcome now looks quite promising.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the earlier amendments have considerably sharpened up the wording of the document, thereby bringing into focus the health aspects for European citizens. It is particularly important from the point of view of those people who have to work with these types of chemical preparations every day. The obligation to provide safety data sheets means that information is available both on the components of the preparations and on how they should be handled. It is essential that everyone has access to these data sheets, regardless of the size of the enterprise – everyone is entitled to a safe working environment. Classification and labelling should not only be carried out where the danger is apparent or life‐threatening, but also where the preparations are allergy‐forming, cause irritation or are harmful to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the rapporteur has done a good job and deserves to be congratulated. The classification of preparations is not an easy subject to discuss, but Mrs Baldi has certainly succeeded. Nevertheless, I should just like to bring up a minor point if I may. Even though it was agreed in committee, I cannot really see the point of Amendment No 1. Perhaps we are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached. But the card has been played, and now it is up to the Commission to make a move.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, let us hope that many more alternatives are found to replace these dangerous preparations, so that we can be spared having to discuss how they are to be regulated and concentrate on finding substitutes instead. None of these preparations can be said to enhance either the environment or people's health in the long term. We must therefore begin by doing our best to find suitable substitutes.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blak </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, the title of this debate is so boring that many people must believe it makes no difference. But behind the words packaging, classification and labelling of dangerous preparations there are some important rules for the environment and, above all, for the working environment. In practical terms, the common position means that painters will now have information about what they are working with. From 1 July 2000, volatile organic solvents will be labelled for their narcotic effects. You may ask yourselves whether this kind of information ought not to be a human right. The improper use of organic solvents was already causing problems 20 years ago. In Denmark, we call it the painter syndrome. Now we are going to get the safety data sheets for which Denmark has been campaigning for many years. We have finally silenced the oil industry, which tried to block the directive with every means at its disposal. The idea that painters are less intelligent than other people has been dispelled for ever, and can in future only be used in history books as an example of how a debate can sometimes degenerate for economic reasons. It should be clear to everyone that the EU is developing in the right direction and that the working environment and public health are now being improved, which is the only way to go if the EU project is to have public support. We will now continue the good work of gaining recognition of the long‐term effects of solvents on the sense of balance, hearing and sight, and explaining the effects of hormone‐like chemicals. Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Madam President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to congratulate Mrs Baldi on a very worthwhile effort. There has been excellent cooperation on this highly technical proposal. Thank goodness we have finally reached the last stage before adoption. The proposal particularly concerns Finland, Sweden and Austria, and it offers an acceptable solution to the difficulties they experienced over their existing legislation on the products in question and pesticides in their membership negotiations. As we know, this led to temporary transitional arrangements for those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament supported the proposal's underlying principles. At the same time, Parliament had to decide on the 26 amendments, which were also adopted. The Commission was able to include the majority of these in the common position, and the discussions in the Council also produced results. In the Commission's view, the common position adopted by the Council meets both the objectives laid down in Article 100a of the Treaty, namely the establishment and functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection. Furthermore, the proposal also takes account of the needs of new Member States. Consequently, the Commission is endeavouring to ensure prompt adoption of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at second reading, Parliament has tabled three amendments, all of which the Commission supports. The first aims to change the committee procedure from type 3b to type 3a, which marks a return to the Commission's original proposal. It so happens that this was the position we adopted in the Council, but it was unanimously voted down. We still think that this amendment would make it easier to carry through the directive. The second amendment, which we also accept, is intended to clarify and improve a particular provision. The third amendment, which the Commission had already approved at first reading, was as you know rejected by the Council, so we would like to retable this amendment as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission warmly welcomes the practical approach adopted by Parliament in only submitting three amendments at this reading. As I have already said, the Commission finds all three acceptable. Naturally, I hope the Council will also give its approval, so that we can avoid conciliation. It is now up to Parliament and the Council of Ministers to make a decision.</p>
