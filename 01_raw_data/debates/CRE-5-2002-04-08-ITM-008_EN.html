<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the topic of the ARGO proposal is a very interesting one. However, it struck me during the reading of the Commission proposal that the draftsmen had already covered themselves quite well against any kind of resistance that might be expected from the Council. In other words, it is my feeling that, in transferring tasks from the third pillar to the first pillar, too many concessions are already being made to technical devices – or even gimmicks – designed to organise things in such a way that the Council bureaucracies still remain in command, while the powers of the European Parliament and the European Commission remain a mere formality.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a hesitant attitude which, in my view, befits a Council Secretariat more than a federal government in the making. The Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of European values and, in my opinion, it should fulfil this task in an assertive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I, with the help of the Parliamentary committee, have tried to strengthen the Community dimension of the proposal on a variety of scores. We therefore want to give the Commission a boost, especially where the Commission’s right of initiative is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of ARGO cannot only be a task of national government offices. It is, for example, very odd that in the case of the enormously successful Odysseus, NGOs etc were able to contribute, but not in the case of its successor, ARGO. This is why I value the reinforcement of the Commission’s right of initiative. This must be emphatically underscored for, via the Commission, others too can share in the success of ARGO. In addition, ARGO cannot simply be a case of collaboration by national bureaucracies. It requires Community guidance, so that the intentions of the directives can be monitored as objectively as possible. Once again, the Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of everything it has presented in directives.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also somewhat annoyed at the way in which both implementation and control are being relinquished, particularly under the pretext of transparency. In my view, transparency hardly ever has anything to do with clubs of officials, but always with representatives of the people. Using the word in another way undermines it completely. That is something we must avoid at all costs. So, on the basis of transparency, we cannot justify monitoring of the procedure by clubs from the national bureaucracies, while the national parliaments and the European Parliament remain outside. I would make particular reference to Article 3, point e).</p>
<p class="contents">According to normal parliamentary and rule-of-law principles, the key points of the policy should be indicated and drafted by the executive power, the Commission, and should be approved and monitored by the representative of the people, the European Parliament. After all, we also have powers in the field of the budget. The implementation details can then be given shape by means of national recommendations, as suggested in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities is needed to establish who monitors what. In my view, the Commission and the European Parliament should be responsible for the Community aspects, while the national authorities and parliaments should take care of national aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say something about the EU’s external borders which will very shortly be moved to coincide with the external borders of the underprivileged candidate countries. In my opinion, ARGO should actually think ahead and should do the groundwork for bringing about communitisation, or common responsibility for the external borders, and preferably on time, for these countries will be joining in only a few years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also seen an amendment with which we struggle. This is the amendment from liberal quarters, which concerns people who are persecuted, but not by government bodies. In most cases, we only talk about those who are persecuted by their own governments for their political beliefs. I think that this, in general, is only fair. If people are persecuted in their own countries by non-government bodies and they can still live safely elsewhere in the country, then they need not necessarily be brought to Amsterdam. They can simply stay in Turkey or Russia. In addition, we would always argue in favour of regional reception. Accordingly, I do not endorse the amendment tabled by Baroness Ludford which favours reception in the European Union, via asylum legislation, of those who could also be sheltered elsewhere in their own countries, and we set great store by making this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament is asking the European Commission to adopt an assertive stance, and I hope that the latter will interpret this as a shot in the arm. Should the Council refuse, there is still time to broadcast the fact at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Boetticher (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span><span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dismantling of our internal borders and the police cooperation associated with it, as well as the securing of our external border, will be among the greatest challenges to face the European Union in the new century. Mr Oostlander, in his report, has earned our gratitude by referring in his report to the need for a common immigration policy on the external borders. My report, though, covers the future development of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement in the area of cross-border surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the internal borders have already been dismantled, the national police are able, after consultation with the police of a neighbouring state, to observe suspects who are active on both sides of the border. Together with hot pursuit, the instrument of cross-border surveillance has thus to date, offered the most effective option in enforcing the law across borders. It was only last week that it became clear in Germany just how necessary such an arrangement is, when hostages were taken following a bank robbery and the culprits fled over the border into Poland and then into the Ukraine. Although there was good cooperation in this instance, an arrangement such as the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement would certainly have made enforcement even easier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council proposal is intended to extend the range of offences liable to cross-border surveillance by adding to them organised fraud, offences in connection with the trafficking in human beings, the laundering of proceeds from organised crime and dealing in radioactive materials. The question remains in my mind as to why we do not also fall back on the catalogue of terrorist offences that we adopted only a few months ago, which I see as having been a very important decision, and one that we should incorporate into this proposal. I therefore felt that Mr Buijtenweg's proposal, and the proposals made by other Members, had something positive to add.</p>
<p class="contents">We otherwise find ourselves increasingly lost in a thicket of innumerable and different regulations on judicial cooperation in criminal matters. We will in the future have to work at standard penal frameworks significantly more than we have done in the past. At the same time, the fact is overlooked that the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement has to date suffered not only from a narrow scope of application, but also from bureaucratic obstacles. I have therefore proposed a number of systematic clarifications, which met with wide-ranging support in the committee. We should, then, have the courage to achieve real new developments and move forward with the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of times that cross-border surveillance has been used has tripled in the time since it was introduced. The most frequent obstacle, according to the officers engaged in its implementation, is often the lack of a right of arrest. Officers carrying out surveillance duties on foreign territory have hitherto had to watch impotently as crimes were committed. They are not permitted to intervene, but can only inform their colleagues with jurisdiction in that state, who tend themselves to be stretched to their full capacity already. By the time they, in their turn, intervene, the culprits are, as a rule, over the hills and far away. I therefore propose that it should also be possible for foreign police officers engaged in cross-border surveillance work to detain culprits until police officers of that state arrive, if, firstly, an extraditable offence has been committed and, secondly, if that State's own police are no longer in a position to prevent the offence being committed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no doubt impossible to get our European citizens to understand why foreign police officers may observe, but are unable to intervene when the situation becomes critical and a crime is being committed. In this respect, we should be significantly better at adapting our laws to the realities of this Europe of ours, which is growing together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, however, continues to develop, it is my firm conviction that there is a need in a Europe that is growing together, for the European Union to have real police competences. Within the framework of the Convention, which, as is well known, is looking to reshape the Treaties, we will not only be able to discuss what competences we might have to relocate in the Member States, but we must also specify the areas in which we additionally need primary competences at a European level. The combating of organised crime, and across borders at that, is one such area, one where we as a Parliament must emphatically make the point that, in order to facilitate control by Parliament and by the public prosecutors, we need a primary police executive for a limited sphere of activity.</p>

<p class="contents">Today we are debating the ARGO programme, the ultimate aim of which is to provide a guarantee of homogenous treatment for third-country nationals. I would like to point out that, in the fields fully or partially covered by this programme, there are very many directives, regulations and other instruments in force, and that this Community acquis must be applied consistently, guaranteeing equal rights to third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some extremely important aspects which the programme should take into account: it is essential that we implement actions to prevent illegal immigration, actions against the counterfeiting of documents and essential actions in the field of consular cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of establishing a common policy in this area is a great challenge and its success largely depends on the Union becoming an area of security and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few years, my country has gone from a country of emigration to a country receiving a large number of immigrants and at the same time is experiencing problems resulting from its status as an external border of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is not an innovation – since it continues the previous Odysseus programme, with certain new approaches – the ARGO programme is a key element. An increase in appropriations is a sign that we are taking a serious approach to the effort we must make to ensure that the national administrations act homogeneously, applying best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, and I congratulate him, because his report contains proposals which improve the text and make it very clear that the Commission and Parliament must play a leading role in the implementation of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, much has been achieved in this field under Commissioner Vitorino, but there is still a very long way to go. It is therefore right and proper that the objectives of the current Presidency include making progress with the Tampere and Laeken commitments on asylum, immigration and border control policies. This requirement does not only stem from the present reality of immigration in the Union, but also from the citizens’ desire for a genuine political Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my firm conviction that it is only through greater cooperation between the authorities of individual States that the existing discrepancies in the application of Community regulations can be removed. Proof that the inequality of treatment in the Member States has to be done away with is provided above all by the great number of petitions addressed to Parliament. In recent years there have been 468 petitions alone on the subject of inequality of treatment in this area. It really is time to do more about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another improvement in comparison with the present Odysseus programme is the explicit inclusion of the visa issue, another area that has seen the submission of numerous petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The electronic exchange of data is of particular importance to cooperation across Europe, and I call for the creation of a common database for the whole of Europe, a database that must be accessible to the competent authorities in the Member States – if need be, to third countries as well – and also to the competent agencies of the European institutions. In this context, the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information must be safeguarded unconditionally and to the fullest extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions. This obligation is the sole protection for the petitioner's legitimate expectations. Delays in passing on information, which have occurred up to now, cause petitioners unacceptable detriment, something which can, in my view, be prevented only by the Committee on Petitions being enabled, in cases of urgency, to bring negative conduct by the authorities to the public's notice. Bad publicity is no doubt something that every public body wants to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want our internal borders to be open, our external borders need surveillance systems that work, and we also need compensatory elements along the lines of cross-border surveillance. That is underlined here with broad strokes of the pen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this purpose that we need the new ARGO action programme. This is not only because the money from Odysseus has been used up. It is also because it must be our objective to build up and create an equal level of security on all our external borders, including those we will have in the future, in order, on the one hand, to safeguard ourselves against illegal immigration, organisations that traffic in human beings, and international organised crime, and on the other, to have available to us opportunities for monitoring, assistance and legal immigration and also for preparation for the grant of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me particularly significant that such measures as the establishment of unitary standards for the use of information technology are highlighted, or that emphasis is laid on the fact that, at the end of the day, we are endeavouring to create common core training, that is, to achieve a common standard of training and qualifications. We should also be trying to tackle our future need for border security operations composed of experts from several Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it significant that – as formerly with Odysseus – the possibility is envisaged of the candidate countries also being able to participate in the programme, whereby we are guaranteeing that they will be optimally prepared for greater security in the greater European Union that we share.</p>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Oostlander and Mr von Boetticher for their reports. I will concentrate my remarks on the Oostlander report and the ARGO system. We recognise that a common approach to immigration, to the question of visas and asylum and our external borders is essential. I do not believe the European Union is functioning properly if we do not have such a common approach. We are moving towards this, and we need to have a realistic and modern interpretation that recognises the situation in Europe and the rest of the world as it is, not one that pretends the situation is different or imagines it as we would like it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address Amendments Nos 41 and 42 to which Mr Oostlander referred and over which he and I have had discussions because these are very important. I am grateful to Mr Schmidt and Baroness Ludford of the Liberal group for tabling Amendment No 42 because this was the subject of a heated exchange in our committee and it was owing to a slight administrative difficulty that it fell one vote short of being passed in committee. The challenge of No 42, by comparison with No 41, was that Amendment No 42 talks about offering asylum and protection to people who are escaping from State and non-State persecution. It is the non-State persecution to which we must address our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">We can all think of countries where we do not like the regime and where people are escaping from being harassed, persecuted and attacked by the State, but here, however, we must consider the cases in which these people are escaping from non-State organisations or bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given examples before about Afghanistan where the Taliban were not recognised as a State. If we did not include this, we would not have been accepting persecution by the Taliban as a reasonable reason for offering asylum to people. Then there are other countries around the World, Somalia for example – about which I am not an expert – where it is difficult to understand what is the State and what is not the State. There are also people fleeing from war-torn countries who need protection. We could have a long list of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there are many countries which are divided by forces of one faction or another, some State and some non-State. It may only be a few, but my group believes we should offer protection to them: that is why we will be supporting Amendment No 42, and I think that it should be voted on before Amendment No 41 because it is stronger and moves in a different direction. If, in Amendment No 41, the words 'and current practice' were to be removed, we would not have quite so much of a problem with supporting it because it says 'in accordance with the Geneva Convention' and there are few people in this Chamber who would be opposed to anything to do with the Geneva Convention, which we support.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few words on enlargement. This poses a real challenge. We have to sort out the whole question of asylum, visas and immigration before enlargement takes place but we must not then use the question of enlargement to expect the applicant countries to have higher standards than we ourselves are adopting. Many applicant countries are doing very well and their economies and standards of living are approaching those of EU countries. Enlargement is not about building a new, more powerful, stronger external frontier. If we have a very successful European Union, we must not allow that to create a further division between us and the countries which will then be outside a new, enlarged Union of 25 or 27 States. It is about sharing responsibility, about making certain that people have opportunities and rights, and we will be supporting that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the committee reading, a number of proposals went through which further strengthened the programme’s common dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is for the EU to acquire a common approach when it comes to asylum issues. It is important, then, for the administrative routines to operate similarly everywhere. Those who try to come to Europe must be treated respectfully, humanely and equally. They must not be shunted like mere objects between the various Member States, as unfortunately often happens at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in recent years indicate very clearly the need for common programmes and common funding within the sphere of asylum. Just as other MEPs have stated, there is a need for education, the exchange of experiences and the development of common practice. The candidate countries, which will form the EU’s new external borders, are also important in this context, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately – and this, I think, is something that deserves to be pointed out – the EU’s refugee and asylum policy has in recent years been characterised mostly by directly opposite tendencies. The Member States have often acted short-sightedly and without proper consideration, with catastrophic human suffering as a consequence. Sometimes, the thought arises as to whether certain Member States have competed in setting aside humanitarianism and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Oostlander pointed out, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment concerning a further definition of what precisely constitutes a refugee under the Geneva Convention. The latter certainly constitutes the mainstay of asylum and refugee policy, but it makes sense to adapt one’s practice to changes in the real state of affairs. As Mr Evans pointed out, experience in recent years has shown that this is so. Refugees must be able to seek protection both from the State and from persecution in their own countries, and a further definition is therefore needed. We therefore propose such a definition, and we hope that this House can also accept our proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The model for this fortification of the EU's borders is Germany's system of bulkheads on its border with Poland. This strategy comprises well-trained police officers, high-tech apparatus, the efficient cooperation of the various authorities, and, to an increasing extent, the involvement of private security companies and informers among the population. I know you will think that crazy, but I will tell you what I think of it in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ARGO programme is meant to ensure the establishment of the same level of fortification on the EU's new eastern border prior to removal of controls on the newly-created internal borders in accordance with the Schengen Agreement. It is no secret that apologists for a European policy of repression see this as the nucleus of a European border police force.</p>
<p class="contents">The action programme aims at the creation of effective bulwarks against the migration into the EU of unwanted refugees, who can scarcely find a way in without the help of smugglers. Greater sealing-off will – as is intended – lead to higher prices being charged in the market for this sort of assistance and make it more hazardous. All the stances taken up in favour of refugees but against people-traffickers are, at best hypocritical and at worst help to close off borders with fatal results. The planned amendments to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement are also in line with the ARGO programme's objectives. The re-armament of the police on the external borders is accompanied by ever more competences for the police in the interior.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, as in this case, it is cooperation by the repressive authorities that is at issue, it is interesting that the role played by borders is relegated to the background. In principle, the planned amendment of the Schengen Agreement envisages nothing other than to hand over more powers to foreign police officers in cases involving cross-border surveillance. In future, it will not only be suspects that will be under observation, but also their friends. The initiative is therefore pursuing the European government's objective of making a priority of the implementation of repressive security measures rather than the guaranteeing and securing of human rights and freedoms. Mr von Boetticher and the Commission thus furnish a further example of the folly of believing that security can be created by more repressive police action.</p>
<p class="contents">Both initiatives thus contribute to a development that directly leads from a neoliberal state characterised by competition to a police state bearing the stamp of authoritarianism and an obsession with security. They represent a further step on that road – the road that leads towards a European panopticon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too would like to thank the rapporteur, but I feel I have to express a few comments on the subject of the right to asylum, a humanitarian principle that no civilised person could fail to support but whose bounds must be very clearly set if we are to avoid the severe, real danger of it being used for the totally unacceptable purpose of facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants into European Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The document before us states that it aims to avoid asylum applicants being moved between States within the Union, but we harbour some doubts as to whether this can be achieved with minimal standards such as those contained in the proposal, considering, not least, the right accorded to the States to provide greater assistance for asylum applicants.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to point out two of the proposal’s shortcomings. Firstly, recourse to the judicial authority is provided for in many cases for the concession or refusal of subsidies, housing, healthcare etc., and this means making an infinite number of people dependent on state welfare and binding the host State by law to providing facilities which, in many cases, it does not even provide for its own citizens. Secondly, application of the principle of the free movement of the applicant and their family will then clearly lead to asylum applicants having less chance of being granted asylum and being more likely to attempt to cover their tracks, with the number of untraceable illegal immigrants increasing as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">These are serious, practical problems. In effect, many rules treat the situation of the applicant as if this status had already been ascertained, for example by regulating access to longer-term activities such as professional training.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the effect of the document needs to be modified so that it does not become a hindrance instead of being a directive providing practical, effective protection of people who have the right to asylum. This is what we fear, that it might become an obstacle to preventing illegal immigration, which is a serious, disturbing phenomenon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, though, to be welcomed that the proposal for Odysseus' successor programme allocates funds, among other things, to improving the training of officials, but what use is a programme of training, exchange and cooperation if no change is made to the overall conditions that have prevailed to date?</p>
<p class="contents">The situation cannot go on in which asylum seekers are turned back at the EU's external borders by the relevant border authorities, as they have been hitherto. The situation cannot go on in which they run the risk of going down a chain of deportation and ending up back in the country where they were persecuted. As the Commission proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States envisaged, their applications for asylum must be examined by an independent authority in the Member State in question. Asylum seekers must be able to have recourse to the law when administrative decisions go against them. That is the least that we can expect of a state founded on the rule of laws such as our own.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that border officials can be as well-trained as you like, but all that good training is of no use if they are entrusted with tasks that cannot but overwhelm them, such as deciding on the welfare or otherwise of asylum seekers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft decision before us today on the proposal by Belgium, Spain and France improves this procedure, notably by adding to the list of offences which justify its use. The responsible committee of the European Parliament is also proposing to add terrorism to this list, which seems wise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, somewhat perplexed by the parliamentary report. By tabling other proposals for amendments such as that seeking to extend the right of surveillance to some private locations or to allow police officers, in some cases, to bypass surveillance and arrest suspects, the committee responsible appears to be giving the impression that it wants to transform cross-border surveillance into the beginnings of a right to multilateral intervention within the framework of a Union that has no internal borders. This kind of move must obviously be rejected, Mr President, as it would, in time, cause confusion as regards responsibilities and the disadvantages would be far greater than any anticipated benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first proposal before us today is a proposal for a financing programme that aims to promote cooperation between the national administrations responsible for implementing Community rules under Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty. The ARGO programme will supplement the legislative initiatives that have already been launched or are due to be launched on the basis of Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty. I agree with Mrs Kaufmann in recognising that the programme must be examined along with the legislation, and I hope that we will be able to agree on legislation. However, we must also acknowledge that in areas such as these, European legislation and its transposal into national law are not enough to harmonise practices. A very important area is the practices that the national administrations follow when they are monitoring the external borders, issuing visas or examining asylum applications and immigration issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As several of you pointed out, the ARGO programme will replace the Odysseus programme. However, there are considerable differences between the two that need to be very clearly defined. First of all, ARGO is a programme for administrative cooperation. That is why it focuses in greatest detail on the national administrations and the services responsible for implementing Community legislation based on Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty. It is wrong to claim that these are simply programmes for cooperation between police forces because, in the area of asylum and immigration, there are extremely important tasks which fall to the civilian administration services of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case – and I must stress this, as it may be an issue on which Mr Oostlander and myself do not agree – the national administrations are the key players in this programme. Indeed, when we have reached agreement on legislation, the national administrations of the Member States will have primary responsibility for applying the European legislation. However, this programme does not rule out the national administrations which receive ARGO funding being able to delegate responsibilities for implementing the programmes in question to non-governmental organisations which propose implementing projects and programmes on the basis of the programme’s objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis of ARGO not only establishes general objectives, it also defines more precise objectives in each of the following areas: external borders, visas, asylum and emigration. ARGO envisages new forms of action such as the definition of better practices, techniques for collating, analysing and disseminating information and actions in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, as regards the monitoring of external borders, the Schengen acquis was split, within the framework of the European Union, with important aspects coming under the first pillar and also important aspects coming under the third pillar. Hence the difficulty in correctly distinguishing between the Community aspect and the intergovernmental cooperation aspect, a distinction that is necessary if we are to target them properly. In any case, I would like to thank Mr Oostlander for the support he has given to the Commission’s proposal and to assure him that we can support, in spirit, many of the amendments that have been proposed, particularly those that seek to strengthen the role of the Community and those seeking to supplement or to strengthen the administrative cooperation objectives. Our priority is to ensure that the Council adopts the programme as soon as possible, so that the Commission can, this year even, launch the procedures necessary for the implementation of the programme and the proper implementation of the budget allocated for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second proposal, which relates to the amendment to Article 40 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, an amendment proposed by Belgium, Spain and France, its objective, as Mr von Boetticher points out, is to grant, under certain conditions, the police force of the Member States the right to continue to keep under discreet surveillance a person suspected of being involved in an extraditable offence if that suspect crosses a border. I hope that this stresses the improvement – which I believe is significant and practical – that this amendment represents for the work of the law enforcement services.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has noted, cross-border observation is an instrument to maintain public order and safety which, with the removal of common borders between Schengen countries, will become extremely important. I would also like to stress that, whilst the proposed change will facilitate enquiries, it will not change the legal framework applying to them, since the national authorities will, of course, only be able to act within their own national legislation, as well as that provided for by the Schengen Convention. I am sorry, but we have a long way to go before we become a totalitarian State.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the two initiatives and proposals before us and on which considerable work has been done by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs should enable a great deal of progress to be made in areas which I believe are crucial for the area of freedom, security and justice which is gradually taking shape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
