<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Csaba Őry (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(HU) </span>I am delighted that such broad consensus, encompassing virtually the whole political spectrum, has emerged among the political groups in Parliament concerning the report on social inclusion. This is no coincidence. It is because we are barely a year into enlargement and there is no doubt that an increase in momentum, in both social and economic terms, would definitely be in the interests of the Union. In this regard, speeding up the process of social inclusion is by no means an issue of secondary importance; the facts show clearly that the new Member States lag behind, to a much greater extent than the old ones, in this area and therefore have a great deal of catching up to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that we do not want a two-speed Europe, a Union where the social protection system is highly developed and of a high standard in one half, while in the other half, it is as full of holes as an Emmental cheese and eroding further, year on year due to government financial difficulties, government budget constraints, restrictive measures and similar difficulties. If such a situation were to arise, then there really would be grounds for concern about social dumping, which we all regard as undesirable. This is why it is important in the period that lies ahead to make genuine progress, perceptible to everyone, in the field of social inclusion. This is the only way we can prevent other social groups in the new Member States from falling into social exclusion. If this were to happen, it would have negative consequences in terms of labour market stability, economic output and social cohesion and would give rise to a whole range of other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is a kind of inventory of the prevailing problems and it paints a fairly accurate picture of the processes currently under way. As regards disadvantaged sections of society, it covers almost every social group affected, focusing particularly on the situation of older people, women, minorities that suffer discrimination – including the Roma – as well as homeless people, people suffering from addiction-related problems, people living with disabilities, children at risk and immigrants. It places particular emphasis on the close links between the provision of education and training opportunities and improved prospects for the disadvantaged citizens accessing them. In the short time-frame available to me, I would like to continue by highlighting just three of the cardinal issues of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first key element is that it is crucial in terms of our future prospects of catching up to recognising the particularly close link that exists between job creation and the economic policies promoting it, and the social systems that represent the primary pillars of social inclusion. It follows logically from this that social inclusion policy can only be successful if it goes in tandem with, is based on and builds on, an appropriate economic policy. If we fail to ensure that the two are in harmony, failure in the social sphere will be inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key element in fact is a structural problem. I am thinking here of the indebtedness of local authorities, which has recently accelerated to a dangerous degree and is closely connected to the fact that local authority finances have been unable to keep pace with the expansion of their social duties. This is not a problem that is exclusive to the new Member States; it is a familiar phenomenon in the old Member States too. Of course it is perfectly logical that governments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, should try to address the majority of problems at local level and the reasoning that most information is always available at local level is perfectly valid. For this to work, however, financial resources need to be provided and this has unfortunately failed to happen in recent years. As a consequence, we now find ourselves in a situation where, for example – if I may cite an alarming case in point – the combined local authority debt of the four ‘Visegrád’ countries has now exceeded the psychological barrier of 10 billion euros. Debt on this scale certainly gives grounds for common reflection at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">For my third point, I would like to refer to the matter of cooperation. It is true – and the report does not dispute this – that social policy is an area of national responsibility of Member States. And so it should be. However, the ability to exercise national competences is by no means impeded by exchanging good practice and sharing information; furthermore, it is in the fundamental interests of all of us. Alongside serious problems, we need to see that there are hosts of good initiatives, innovative ideas that point the way forward and successful projects. Why should we not share these with each other? Unfortunately, the situation at present is that the new Member States pay too little attention to each other and so in most cases, things that could potentially be common treasures, stay hidden and others are unaware of their existence. Appropriate institutional frameworks for this are lacking too. So, in my opinion, these are the three main areas in which we need to make substantive progress. Allow me once again to express my thanks to the political groups and to my colleagues for their highly constructive and helpful support throughout the process of drafting the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very timely and helpful report, which should significantly strengthen our efforts to promote social inclusion across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the points and policy priorities recommended in the document are very much in line with, and reinforce, the Commission's own analysis of the situation. The report is also very useful as it draws attention to a number of issues that require greater emphasis and more effort from Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of tackling poverty and social exclusion and building a more inclusive Union was reinforced in the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Brussels. The social inclusion process will operate in parallel with and complement the Lisbon agenda, focusing on economic growth and employment. In that way our efforts in the areas of economic growth, employment policy and social cohesion can reinforce each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing mid-term evaluation of the EU's social inclusion process will, towards the end of the year, lead to a communication proposing new integrated and streamlined common objectives and working methods for the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion. The points raised in your resolution are a very valuable contribution to the current evaluation of the process. We will take them into account when we prepare our communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been making significant progress on several issues raised in the report since the Commission and the new Member States prepared their joint memoranda on social inclusion in 2003. I should like to mention two of them: harmonisation of statistics and the exchange of learning.</p>
<p class="contents">You rightly emphasise the importance of harmonising poverty statistics and criteria defining poverty. There has been very good cooperation between the national statistics offices and Eurostat in developing our new statistical instrument, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC. That will certainly help us monitor progress across the Union. As regards the exchange of good practice, the new Member States have been playing an increasingly active role in the current Community Action Programme on Social Exclusion. The proposed new Community Action Programme (Progress) will, from 2007, allow us to further extend the exchange of learning and good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue raised in the report is increasing the resources available for social inclusion matters. In this regard responsibility rests primarily with the national authorities. However, the Commission put strong emphasis on ensuring that the use of European social funds is closely connected with the goals indicated in the national action plans on employment and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As clearly stated in the resolution, improvement is required in almost all the dimensions of social life. At the same time, most new Member States are undergoing difficult economic reforms and many are faced with high levels of unemployment. There are also significant budgetary constraints, which limit the room for manoeuvre for social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be realistic and bold in addressing these major structural issues. Ensuring economic and employment growth will certainly help to increase social cohesion, but investing in social inclusion and human capacity is an essential complementary element in supporting sustainable employment and economic progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will help ensure that we continue to have a strong social inclusion process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament supports and upholds this step.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls in particular on the Commission to succeed in outlining a common policy in the form of a common theme, a clear policy shared by all of the Member States. In order to do this, the European Commission has to consider the appropriateness of choosing the open method of coordination, which is clearly unable to fully achieve the assigned objective; make sufficient funds available for the project, in order to make the citizens and residents of the new Member States more involved in the European project; carry out an evaluative across-the-board analysis, refocusing on the failure to respect civil liberties, access to fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, and facilitate the task of preparing any sanctions that may be needed; highlight more clearly the problems relating to access to the law and justice, with a more detailed analysis of migration patterns, distinguishing between immigration of third-country nationals and the situation of other ethnic or cultural minorities; review the existing division of responsibilities between the Union, the Member States and the regions, and propose means of institutionalising the ‘best practice’ approach; ensure access to the legal system for vulnerable groups and minorities; unify, streamline and simplify the emergency procedures and resolve the remaining problems regarding stateless or other persons in difficulty who continue to be denied citizenship or the right of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these efforts concerning fundamental rights, the European Union can develop towards achieving a greater level of justice and shared civic values, which are the foundations of the social Europe that we all hope and pray for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has identified these challenges very clearly, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and the related problem of social inclusion have a specific dimension in the new Member States. This is not only because the poverty threshold is considerably lower in absolute terms, which means that poverty is ultimately more severe than in the 15 old Member States; it is also because poverty takes on special forms for the women of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All sources indicate that single parents and older women are the most likely to face a greater risk. The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality therefore highlights extreme forms of poverty and an absolute shortage of comparable and reliable data. However, there is a very dangerous phenomenon that seems to be emerging, and which has been overshadowed by data on the adult population, namely the high risk of child poverty. Although analyses indicate that poverty affecting children is often more severe and that the number of children facing the risk of poverty is increasing, exact figures are not available. University research conducted in 2001 estimated that the risk of child poverty in the old Member States exceeded that of the adult population by as much as 14%. A national report on youth policy which was published in my country yesterday states that the proportion of children facing poverty is 30%, or as much as 40% for those in single families. It is impossible to ignore the correlation between this figure and the alarmingly high number of early school-leavers: 14% of girls and 18% of boys in Europe in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, poverty is generally said to have a woman’s face. We should perhaps modify this generalisation: poverty has a child’s face. When considering implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Inclusion Strategy, we should bear this in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report highlights some of the problems and some of the causes. It also pinpoints some of the solutions. However, what is so impressive is that this report does not come from an MEP from one of the old Member States, lecturing the newcomers on what they should do to catch up; this rapporteur comes from one of the new Member States. He writes with passion and knowledge about the problem, because he understands what needs to be done, because he is not afraid to pinpoint failings in his own country, and because he cares. He is a perfect example of one of the many talented MEPs who have joined this Parliament following enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">He is right to flag the need for better education and right to raise the importance of increased funding by central government in this regard. He is also right to talk about improving labour mobility, because unless there is more flexibility in the labour markets, the economies cannot fulfil their growth potential and the funds will simply not be there for governments to spend. There is a lesson here, too, for older Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the wisdom of the rapporteur and I congratulate him strongly on his report.</p>

I would remind the House that the report he has drafted on social inclusion in the new EU Member States, which we are today discussing together, was approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by a majority of 32 votes to 4. The result of the vote is, then, a clear demonstration that we all, across the political spectrum, recognise and acknowledge the urgency of problems relating to social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we are not unfamiliar with this finding. We all know that representatives of European governments and countries came to the same conclusions at the Lisbon summit in 2000, when the war on poverty and social exclusion was made one of the central topics and conditions for modernising the European social model. Despite certain hesitations, this view was also confirmed at this year’s spring summit in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the results achieved during the last five years, it is clear that the war on poverty and social exclusion is nowhere near over, and that considerable efforts and resolve will be needed even after 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has undertaken a truly difficult task in comparing the state of social exclusion in the 10 new Member States. These countries differ not only from each other; fundamental differences also exist between the regions within them. Although there is still room for elaborating and harmonising common indicators that would most faithfully reflect the actual situation in these countries and, at the same time, enable us to discover examples of new practices, this action by the European Commission is undoubtedly a step forward. I would like to use this occasion to call on its representatives to cooperate as closely as possible in the future and to make use of the resources and knowledge of non-governmental organisations and social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the fact that although the report that we have before us today describes and endeavours to compare the situations in the 10 new Member States, we must not forget that the threat of poverty and social exclusion is faced by every EU Member State, albeit not to the same degree.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion is often expressed that social partners, and in particular trade union organisations, should be closely involved in all measures in order to help solve the problem of social exclusion; indeed, the question of whether they should take over the functions of state and local authority has even been considered. Such opinions are no more than an illusion, however, at least in the meantime. The restructured trade unions in the new Member States are in a difficult situation; they are subject to pressure, they lack the necessary structures and they do not have effective tools available to them. Mr Őry is well aware of this, as am I, since we have both worked in trade unions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to the Constitutional Treaty and the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">An understanding of the most complex social problems faced by the Member States and a desire to solve these problems would render moot many of the arguments put forward by those who voted against the Constitution. The reason for this is that many issues relating to EU enlargement were either misrepresented to these voters or misunderstood by them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Őry report is thus concerned with solutions to problems that have a direct bearing on the EU’s future. Our debate on this issue, and the majority by which the House adopts the report, will prove that we are aware of the significance of this problem, and that we know it involves banishing the spectre of social dumping from the European Union. What is more, the fact that the goals of competitiveness and social cohesion as enshrined in the Lisbon strategy are complementary rather than mutually exclusive is emphasised. This was why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlined the importance of economic development in facilitating social inclusion during its debates on the report, and indeed the Commissioner also stressed this aspect of the issue a short while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to congratulate Mr Őry on the way in which this report has been drafted. I am delighted that the aforesaid Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted it by an overwhelming majority. Improvements could perhaps have been made to the way in which the proposed amendments were incorporated. In fact a number of the amendments I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were ignored, even though they would have improved the report without making any fundamental changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are debating today is an excellent one, and my group will vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to make some comments about the process of EU integration. In the majority of the new Member States, the only social stratum benefiting from EU accession is the national, economic and political elite. As can be seen in the report, the gap between rich and poor has become wider. For example, in my country, Latvia, a recent opinion poll showed that 84% of the population thought that their standard of living was much better ten years ago. The national, economic and political elite is mostly responsible for the current social disintegration in their countries. However, because they have ignored the unfavourable changes in the new EU Member States, the EU institutions must bear part of the blame.</p>
<p class="contents">The social instability in the new Member States is endangering political stability and economic growth not only in those states, but also in the EU as a whole. This is the result of a number of mistakes made by EU institutions during the enlargement process. One such mistake was to ignore the fact that in two Baltic States, Latvia and Estonia, a significant part of the population is stateless. These so-called ‘aliens’ belong to national minorities, and the fact that they are deprived of political rights promotes social exclusion and means that persons belonging to minorities cannot compete on equal terms in the labour market</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, yesterday, during the vote on the amendments to the report by Mr Moraes on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies, the recommendations that these people should be given the right to participate in local elections and granted freedom of movement within the Community were removed as a result of the amendments tabled by some political groups. This totally ignores the EU's own recommendations made in 2004 as part of the enlargement process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that this is the first such report to be drafted by a Member from a new Member State. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing crises everywhere we turn in today’s European Union. The smaller countries adhere to the Stability Pact, while the larger ones adhere to other principles. All this affects the new Member States, which are still being called on to comply fully with a raft of often nonsensical measures, as the previous speaker rightly emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">Social problems principally affect poor regions, regardless of whether these are located in old or new Member States. Disabled people currently account for 10% of the population, yet only a few countries can be said to have legislation in place that makes at least partial improvements to the everyday situation of these people, including at work. Problems are faced by national minorities, school-leavers, women and the over-fifties. People from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds represent a major problem, and refugees are starting to become one.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the main problem faced by the European Union as a whole? The problem is a system that strives to leave everything to the invisible hands of the market. I should like to cite just three examples by way of illustration. The privatisation of drinking water sources and sewage systems has increased the price of a cubic metre of water more than a thousand-fold. My second example, the enormous pressure to liberalise the rental market, means that 50-70% of pensioners’ incomes in the new European Union countries is now spent on accommodation. And what about tomorrow? Few flats are being built, the mobile labour force often lives in critical conditions, and the situation for unemployed people, young families, disabled persons and pensioners is becoming critical. A third example is disabled people, who form an ever-greater proportion of the unemployed. In the Czech Republic, in northern Bohemia, say, the rate of unemployment among disabled people has risen from 8% 10 years ago to over 12%, despite the measures that have been taken. This is a stark warning.</p>
<p class="contents">People are being asked to join a society where public services have been shut down, public transport is expensive in spite of ever more threadbare networks, crèches are being abolished and the number of nursery schools reduced, after-school activities are being done away with or scaled down, which often involves high financial demands on parents, and the status of trade unions is worsening, as a result of attempts to abolish the labour code. All these are manifestations of extreme liberal tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, do you think that our citizens are blind to the extreme liberal language of the Constitutional Treaty? Do you know nothing of the topics discussed in the debate held prior to the referenda in France and Holland? Do you want statistical shortcomings to increase pressure on the new Member States, which are being forced into the ruthless privatisation of all state property? Do you not know that the new Member States are becoming an experimental terrain for the original 15 Member States, in order to test how much more people can take? Am I right, ladies and gentlemen, or is the ‘social state’ dead and we are heading in a completely different direction?</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that we have before us a draft report on social inclusion. The fundamental questions are covered in it, as well as being scattered between the lines, even though our future direction, including basic social standards, is still missing. This is a step in the right direction, but a small and timid one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two thirds of these people live in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his accurate depiction of this complex problem, the solution to which is to slash the number of areas of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. The latter are frequently interrelated, and are sometimes passed on from one generation to the next, which is a point I should like to stress. All our strategies and debates will be worthless unless they achieve certain goals. Firstly, they must make it possible for rapid assistance to be provided to those who need it. This is an important albeit short-term goal that requires appropriate funding. Secondly, they must eliminate poverty, which is the main cause of social disintegration, or at the very least greatly reduce it. This is a long-term goal, and in order to achieve it we will need to boost the economic regeneration of the new regions, thus mitigating the scourge of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I should like to pay tribute to all those working to achieve these goals throughout the EU, especially in the 10 new Member States. I should therefore like to thank local governments and NGOs, including in particular Caritas, as well as social welfare institutions and philanthropists for the work they do. I should like to thank those who create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should like to dwell upon just two issues in detail. The first of these is the family. Demographic indicators are causing alarm bells to ring, and assistance for families raising children is a necessity rather than generosity on anyone’s part. We need to find the right solutions. Secondly, there are over 45 million disabled people in the EU. They should at long last be made to feel that they have the same rights as any other EU citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is also a moral dimension to the issues under debate. It is far from easy for a man who has eaten his fill to understand a man who is hungry.</p>

The post-Communist countries have experienced so many changes and transformations over a short space of time that our heads are still spinning.</p>
<p class="contents">One-time Communists quickly found their feet in this new situation. After plundering state coffers, they metamorphosed into businessmen or remained in politics. The weakest in society, and by this I mean whole social classes, have been the least able to find their bearings in the new set-up. Workers have lost their jobs and found themselves in debt after being deprived of their means of production and their markets. Health care is no longer accessible to everyone. The welfare state has downed tools, and citizens have discovered they have been left to their own resources overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Polish citizens do not have much faith in their own politicians. Instead, they place their trust in the EU and pin great hopes on it. More money is needed to achieve our ambitious goals of social inclusion, job creation and the promotion of entrepreneurship. This is a strategically important stage of the debate on the EU budget, and the Commission and the Council should not forget that every euro invested in the new Member States remains in the EU’s pocket and amounts to investing in the EU itself.</p>

The task facing the ill-equipped local authorities in the new Member States is huge: the low levels of economic activity and to an extent low levels of employment; the modest resources available for allocation to health care in nominal terms despite the fact that the amounts are not proportionally smaller; the particular shortcomings of the education system and social exclusion of minorities. They are supposed to give greater emphasis to activities aimed at the inclusion of disadvantaged social groups by means of their integration and indeed participation, as this area is the wellspring both of the problems that threaten our social cohesion and of the competitiveness we seek. Failure to do so will make it impossible to achieve the Lisbon objectives. In order to speed up the process of social inclusion, a change in attitude is needed; Member States, local authorities, the private sector and civil sector alike must all assume a share of the responsibility – without prejudice!</p>
<p class="contents">Much more funding needs to be allocated for this purpose. Inter-institutional cooperation needs to be better coordinated. Those who voted no to the Constitution were expressing their bitter disappointment concerning the question of Europe’s ability to confront its biggest challenge, namely increasing competitiveness while at the same time retaining the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing system of coordination is inadequate and so is the added value that we can expect from the economic research institute</p>
<p class="contents">In the social welfare sector, new projects are needed that reflect the European dimension of social policy, high-quality projects that provide regular information to those affected and seek to involve them. Later on, this could even take on the concrete form of a common research institute, an organisational expression of the essence of social Europe, examining the social and institutional conditions for enhancing competitiveness and exploring the management of social issues within an innovative paradigm.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the best social policy, without a doubt, is redistribution of employment opportunities across society and provision of labour market training.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak from experience when I say that this dimension has so far been completely neglected in the new Member States, where immigration is not yet reflected at the level of communication. Let them be able to draw pensions, too, irrespective of the applicant’s age, gender or origin, in all Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
