<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Foster (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States gave new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security. The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA, instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and was amended at first reading. However, the attached technical annex, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference, ECAC, Document 30, was not amended until second reading due to the fact that the high-level group had been updating the annex which was only finalised last November.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Parliament responded speedily to that challenge, and I thank colleagues from all parties for their support, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this process, I have met with representatives from the Council and the Commission and consulted widely with the industry. The draft regulation principally concerns access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement. The scope does not extend to onboard security which may need to be addressed at some future date. The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in its Document 30 part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 which, as already mentioned, has recently been updated. ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out to Parliament, and perhaps the Council, if there is anybody there, that this agreement reached by the 38 countries, will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties. Document 30 previously had been used for general guidance only.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the Council of Transport last December was more than disappointing, as all the amendments supported by Parliament were rejected in the common position. Nevertheless as rapporteur, I took a decision to re-table all amendments which had been adopted and shall touch on five areas which are fundamental to Parliament's position.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Member States must assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks and recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens. These attacks were against the Nation States. I have submitted an amendment to this effect, and I am now pleased to say that there is cross-party support for this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected in real operating conditions, as is currently the case in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, whilst recognising that some Member States and indeed a minority of MEPs reject the measure of 100% screening of staff, I insist that this is a pivotal point in this legislation. It should be said that some Member States already implement this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism has taken on a new dimension. It is misguided to believe that there should be lower standards of security for staff working in restricted areas in airports than for passengers. History has shown us that, over the last 30 years in the vast majority of cases of terrorist acts, such as hijacking and incidents such as Lockerbie and 11 September, lax security measures and personnel who have had unfettered access in airports have played a significant part. I am pleased to say that the majority of MEPs in committee overwhelmingly supported this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is vital that, as is the current practice in IATA and ECAC, the aviation industry itself is involved in the implementation stage of this regulation, not least because it would ensure that measures are practicable and operationally viable.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects of 11 September on the aviation industry and tourist sector. Around a quarter of a million directly related jobs were lost worldwide and some fifty thousand in the EU alone. Not only big businesses were affected, but thousands of small businesses as well. This report is not the sole solution, but it is an enormous step in the right direction, providing that Member States recognise their obligation to protect their citizens by accepting their responsibility to contribute financially to these additional security measures and taking urgent action to restore public confidence, which would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole. I urge the Council to listen to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of my group, to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur who has not only done a vast amount to familiarise herself with this complicated material – indeed, she is a veritable expert on it now – but has also tried as far as possible to make some excellent proposals. We are very disappointed with the Council, though. When, in December, we tried to find a common approach at first reading, it proved incapable of talking with us at all. In the last two weeks as well, when, following the committee discussions, the rapporteur again tried to reach agreement with the Council, the latter was again unable to oblige. I have to say that it is shocking that, in a situation following 11 September when passengers are in danger, the Council is unable to quickly reach an agreement with us.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a counter-example. Just a few weeks ago, the Council and Parliament together took no more than three months to find a practical solution to the issue of restrictions on airport operations due to noise. The fact, however, that, on as important a matter as that of passenger safety, the Council is unable to reach an agreement with us is disgraceful, and we need to say so in no uncertain terms. I also hope that, if we vote as one tomorrow, the Council will have second thoughts and will want to join with us in finding a solution through the conciliation procedure. I would also appeal to the Commission too to tell the Council that we have done everything to reach an agreement with it. The Council was unable to oblige, and I now expect the Commission to support the vast majority of our amendments at least. The Council must see Parliament and the Commission acting together.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make two observations. Firstly, it is very important that the Member States acknowledge that they have to bear some of the costs of the increased security measures. It is simply not acceptable that, at public expense, the police in my country patrol and oversee every football match, from which the professional clubs do not earn such a bad living, while the Member States do not wish to make their contribution to the cost of increased security measures at airports, which are in the interests of everyone and not only of the airports. That is simply not on. We expect the Council to accommodate us on this crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second, somewhat critical question – and one addressed by Mrs Foster – is that of whether employees really need to be vetted 100%. My group shares the rapporteur’s opinion, but I for my part take a different view of this issue. Allow me again to point out that, unlike passengers, employees are in principle vetted before they are taken on. If they were then to be checked up on five or six times a day, then that would be a bit too much of a good thing. We have to realise that, important as security is, there must also be practical arrangements at airports and for the passengers and airlines that use them. I therefore hope that we take a different decision tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who committed these criminal acts on 11 September were not airport or airline employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone is agreed that it is of great importance that this matter should be brought to a prompt close. The events of 11 September represented a very pressing reason for this. The same strict rules must now apply across the Union. It is therefore beyond belief that the Council should be reluctant to accommodate the wishes of the co-legislator, the European Parliament, and that as a result, we should be forced to table so many amendments at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the rapporteur, Mrs Foster, and we too believe that the central issue concerns a transparent and coordinated system that funds the necessary security measures. Distortion of competition must be avoided. There are at the moment still too many discrepancies between the Member States where security measures are concerned, particularly the funding thereof. The Commission should promptly develop proposals in this respect. In these proposals, it should aim for the highest possible level of security. Additional expenses which the new rules entail, if they put the operation of certain airports at risk, should be reimbursed, whereby, however, the principle applies that in the medium term, the costs must be borne by the users and the sector. The measures to be drafted should be based on the ECAC recommendations. In our view, following existing practice will promote streamlining.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the principle of random inspections. These have a preventive effect. And this is in line with the view that, with regard to security, as few compromises as possible should be made. Exceptions should be kept to a minimum. This is why we support the rapporteur’s proposal to delete item 4 in Annex 3.2, where it is made possible not to screen all staff. Needless to say, we do not consent to the creation of this exception.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Council has appeared unsympathetic to our requests to strike better deals on security as well as security measures with third countries too. This is rather strange, for leaks in the new system can be sprung in precisely those areas. In Europe too, countries can be found where it is possible to escape security measures in flights to the EU. It happened to me twice that I stepped onto a plane in an Eastern European country without any security or bomb control. Finally, a point that we have mentioned many times and also have to repeat on this occasion, is that we fail to grasp why the Council is opposed to granting the competition authority the possibility to carry out evaluations. It is, in our view, important that an amendment is once again tabled on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We still have a number of unresolved issues before us on which we should try to achieve a balanced result which suits everyone. As has already been said here before, the Council, for its part, has not done its homework sufficiently well and has not considered or discussed Parliament’s proposals at all thoroughly. It is therefore reasonable for our committee to propose that some key amendments be revised even though we are now on the home straight.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled Amendment No 34 to Article 4, which concerns legal provisions for small airports. Flexibility is needed here. The amendment makes the wording more specific in such a way that at the same time it increases flexibility with regard to the types of aircraft being used. I would also ask Members to consider whether that form of wording achieves a compromise that suits us all with regard to solving the problem of small volumes of air traffic without incurring enormous costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to emphasise the importance of Amendment No 8, which concerns announced inspections. It is important. If there is a constant threat of an EU inspection, standards tend to be kept up. However, if an inspection had to be announced, everything necessary to improve security for air travel would not be done beforehand. In addition we have to ensure that matters drawn attention to after the inspection are actually put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has worked on the assumption that it must be taken into account in dealing with these matters what it is reasonable to do at EU level and what it is better to leave to the Member States’ own discretion, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. For that reason we are not very keen on amendments that mean increased costs without, however, significantly improving security. Action taken must be in proportion to what is reasonable for each country. The same goes for monitoring, where it is only sensible to take account of the particular circumstances that apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Foster for her magnificent work and the professionalism she has shown throughout these months.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, less than a month after the tragic events of 11 September the Commission proposed, through this initiative, to toughen the security requirements applicable to civil aviation in a harmonised manner and, when this proposal was sent to Parliament and the Council, it was considered urgent to reach an agreement in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament agreed with this urgency and therefore acted by focusing on the main provisions of the Regulation and left aside the technical annex which was based on the work of a specialised body, the ECAC (European Civil Aviation Conference) and particularly on its document No 30 on air security.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the text has been analysed in more detail, the Commission understands that the Committee on Transport is proposing 33 amendments to the common position. Last week we attempted to reach a compromise on the issue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission and, as Mr Jarzembowski and Mrs Foster pointed out a moment ago, unfortunately that has not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission insists on the urgency of this document. If an interinstitutional dispute arises, I fear that we could find ourselves in a deadlock. I would therefore ask once again for a spirit of compromise, both on the part of the Council and on the part of Parliament, so that, before the summer, we can finally resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress something that I have said on other occasions, and that is that the Commission will always carry out its work as a mediator, seeking agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would classify the amendments in four categories.</p>
<p class="contents">The first category, which is aimed at tightening the rules on air security, is the one containing the greatest number of amendments and we can accept practically all of them. Furthermore, Amendment No 8, which requests surprise airport inspections, is acceptable in principle. It proposes that airports should not be warned of inspections, but the Commission would like the inspection to be carried out with the knowledge and cooperation of the national regulatory authorities, as happens in the case of competition inspections or agriculture. That is to say, the national regulatory authorities would be informed but not the specific airports. We believe that that would provide the appropriate balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 16, which has the Commission’s support, deserves a special mention. It deals with the requirement that all staff should be subject to controls on accessing security areas. The Commission agrees that air staff should be subject to the same controls as passengers and not to lower levels. We should remember that many terrorist incidents have resulted from a lack of security within airport installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the rapporteur’s Amendment No 20 is to increase security. In this case the Commission believes that it would very much complicate things without really yielding concrete results and, for this reason, we must reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission generally rejects the amendments in the second package, which try to reduce security standards. I am talking about Amendments Nos 6, 13, 17, 27, 30 and 31 and in particular No 6 and No 13. The first is aimed at increasing the number of airports exempt from harmonised Community rules, by raising the threshold for the size of aircraft. Since the Commission has not been provided with any indication of the number of additional airports which would be exempt from the Regulation if this amendment were adopted, we reject it, since it introduces a legally unknown situation. We also reject Amendment No 13, which proposes delaying the entry into force of certain elements of the Regulation by twelve months, since all of the security rules in the Regulation are based on rules approved by the ECAC, which all the States of the Union belong to. We believe that its application should not be delayed even more, but that, on the contrary, it is urgent that the Regulation be applied as soon as possible, as Mr Jarzembowski said a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments is aimed at extending the scope of the Regulation, which explicitly lays down the obligation for Member States to fund additional security measures and be responsible for them. The Commission is sympathetic to these arguments – I would like to make this very clear – and in particular Amendment No 7 on the equitable funding of additional security costs. But these amendments are not appropriate in this Regulation, and do not fall within the scope of Article 80 of the Treaty, which is its legal basis. Furthermore, in the event that it were possible to include rules on additional funding in this Regulation, those rules would not invalidate the superior Community rules on state aid which are still applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission formally rejects Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, although it is willing to examine the issues raised from a broader point of view, including the need for greater organisation in the field of the funding of investments in air security. If necessary, after carrying out a detailed study, the Commission is willing to present a legislative proposal, but in a separate form and not within this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission completely accepts all those amendments aimed at improving the Regulation from a grammatical point of view, while maintaining its content. Therefore, Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21 to 26, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34 and Amendments Nos 14, 15 and 18 could be accepted after certain textual changes. The Commission and the European Parliament generally share a very similar position in this field. Both of us believe that good basic harmonised standards are necessary for security in civil aviation and that particular emphasis should be placed on this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Once approved, the proposal will represent a very important step towards guaranteeing a high level of air security throughout the European Union. Parliament, and in particular Mrs Foster, through her magnificent work throughout the production of this report, is making a very significant contribution towards achieving this result. What we also need now is a cooperative attitude on the part of the Council and to finally achieve amongst all of us a compromise which allows us to move forward and which prevents the blocking of an issue which we must resolve as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is urgent that we apply harmonised rules as soon as possible in order to guarantee greater security in all airports and throughout the European civil air transport system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
