<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Junker (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in the 1990s that the great UN conferences gave new impetus to international cooperation and in particular to the relations between the poor and the wealthy countries in the world. Among them was the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, held in September 1994. Its tenth anniversary, which is almost upon us, cannot fail to be an occasion for drawing up a review of what has become of the ambitious Programme of Action, which the considerable number of 179 states voted to adopt. If I may anticipate the rest of my speech, the result is somewhat disappointing when measured against the claims made for it then. It was in Cairo that population development was first bracketed with global development and core development policy objectives, whereas population growth had formerly been dealt with as a wholly separate issue, and birth control and family planning had not been considered in relation to society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Doing this for the first time was Cairo’s principal achievement. It chose as its primary objectives the eradication of poverty, sustainable economic growth, educational opportunities for all population groups, especially for girls and women, gender equality and equal rights for men and women, protection, support and encouragement for the family, facilitation of general access to reproductive health, family planning and sexual health services, and a reduction in infant, child and maternal mortality rates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cairo Action Programme placed the right – and I emphasise the right – to reproductive health and family planning at the heart of a new understanding of population policy, and so it is on this that my report focuses. It will be clear from the appended statistics how dire is the situation of women in developing countries as regards their reproductive health and the continuing high death rates among infants, children and their mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you some details of the misery of women around the world. Every year, one million women die as a result of infections of the reproductive organs, including sexually transmitted diseases, but excluding HIV/Aids. Every minute, though, ten people are infected with the HIV virus, half of them being under 24 years of age. Every minute, a woman dies as a result of complications associated with pregnancy. Every year, 175 million women become pregnant, and, of those, at least 75 million do not want to be. Every minute, some 100 pregnancies are terminated, 40 of them unsafely carried out by persons with no medical training. Every year, 70 000 women die as a result of botched terminations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, for the avoidance of misunderstanding, that termination of pregnancy cannot, of course, be a family planning method, but if women are in dire need and have no other way out, then they must be enabled to have a safe termination. According to a well-known African doctor, ‘If as many young men were dying each day, about 1 450 per day or 529 000 per year, from causes that were largely preventable, it would be a matter for the Security Council<span class="italic">.</span>’ The risks involved, though, are far from equal. In developing countries, complications arising from pregnancy and birth are the main cause of death and disablement for women of child-bearing age. To put it another way, the risk of dying during pregnancy or as a result of it is 150 times greater for women south of the Sahara than it is for women in Europe. In Denmark, a woman dies for this reason every four months; in Afghanistan, it is every 26 minutes. I could give many other comparisons.</p>
<p class="contents">These data should throw into relief the urgent need for action across the board, to which the signatory states at Cairo committed themselves to the tune of billions. Most of them have failed to follow this commitment through; not even one-half of the sum promised has actually been produced, although the developing countries have, in percentage terms, done more to meet the targets than have the countries of the North. The United Kingdom has just given us a good example of how to do it by increasing from GBP 4.5 million to GBP 6 million its funding per annum for the UN’s family planning programme. This is also a response to President Bush’s restrictive policy, which has sparked protests around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently too, the Commission on Population and Development of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, has also come to the conclusion, looking back at Cairo, that population and reproductive health are highly important issues that must therefore form part of development programmes and strategies to combat poverty, and that this would be the only way to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. That is in line with the conclusions in my report, which are addressed to the Commission, for European development cooperation, too, must actively help every couple and every individual to avail themselves of the fundamental right to good health and the free exercise of their own responsibility in determining the number of children they will have and the age at which they will have them.</p>
<p class="contents">For over 90 years, the International Women’s Day has been a day of political campaigning for women’s rights. In Europe, too, there is – as we have heard – still much to be done, but we European sisters must admit that we are lamenting from something of a great height; what we have achieved, most women in developing countries can only dream of. International Women’s Day must make us more aware of the need for international solidarity. The message of my report on Cairo ten years on to the women of the South is that their European sisters are standing alongside them. Even there, the rays of hope are multiplying. Which of the world’s parliaments do you think has the highest proportion of women members? Finland’s? Sweden’s? Neither has anything to be ashamed of, but Rwanda’s, with over 48%, does better than either. This gives us grounds for hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo was a watershed event that presented the people of the world with a comprehensive approach to sexual and reproductive health and rights. The global community agreed on the importance of reproductive rights and advancing gender equality and on the importance of all women and men being able to access comprehensive health services. The European Union fully endorsed the Cairo commitments at the time, and continues to do so. In 2000, the adoption by the United Nations of the Millennium Development Goals gave renewed focus to many of the concerns raised at Cairo and offered the opportunity to reinforce efforts and undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ten years on from Cairo, several factors are now threatening the achievement of the goals set at that conference. I note in particular that development aid funds for improved reproductive health services are not increasing sufficiently, that the HIV/AIDS pandemic is devastating social and economic structures and that the global political climate is hampering progress in reproductive health. In this context, I refer in particular to the 'global gag rule', or Mexico City policy, as reinstated by President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative by the European Parliament is both very welcome and timely, coming as it does at the beginning of the year of Cairo +10, when progress on sexual and reproductive health and rights is under threat. The resolution is very solid and covers sexual and reproductive health activities comprehensively. I am particularly pleased to see that Parliament calls for the need to fully integrate programmes for sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV, with those addressing sexual and reproductive health needs in general. I also very much appreciate how much gender issues are highlighted and closely linked to sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">Reproductive health services, including family planning, are in the front line of HIV/AIDS prevention and maternal health. The need for universal access is even more urgent now than in 1994, given the dramatic increase in the numbers of people infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. Maternal mortality also remains alarmingly high in too many countries, with more than half a million women worldwide dying prematurely each year owing to pregnancy-related causes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our support for the implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action, the European Community provided approximately EUR 655 million in direct support to these activities between 1994 and 2001. Applying pro rata shares to all health-related support, including humanitarian assistance, the total European Community support to these activities over this period was about EUR 1.42 billion, or just over 12% of total international donor support to the Cairo activities. Furthermore, we are supporting research into HIV/AIDS through the European and developing countries' clinical trials partnership programme, with an initial allocation of EUR 200 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission supports the proposed resolution. We will take careful note of its contents and will give due consideration to each point. In our opinion the main objectives at the present time are to reaffirm our support for the ICPD and the Cairo commitments and to counter the global campaign against it, to consolidate the progress made so far and also to support continued high-quality work on sexual and reproductive health and rights at all levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important issue and Mrs Junker deserves our congratulations. I have three concerns; firstly, it is quite clear – and you have just reminded us, Commissioner – that the countries committed to Cairo have not met their obligations: 45% in the year 2000 is inadequate; secondly, Mr Bush’s reluctance to grant any more money to people dealing with issues of this nature; and thirdly, enlargement, as certain EU countries do not wish to offer women sufficient help with birth control, which was one of the issues at stake in Cairo. We must not forget that what we had before Cairo, in 1994, was management and control of the population; since then, we have had the concept of birth control and control of our own bodies, which is substantially different. In view of these three concerns, what I propose – and have proposed to the Commission – is a framework agreement. We must coordinate our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have understood you rightly, Commissioner, your only wish is to support this report and these projects. Should we not, however, be just a little more assertive and proactive? In other words, should we not take the measures that are needed to actually achieve the Cairo objectives? I said I have three concerns, but I could add a fourth. NGOs are very anxious to see how universal access to care, of which Mrs Junker has just reminded us, is going to work within the balance of public and private finance. If this balance is not maintained and if public space – in other words, universal access to care and to birth control resources – is not guaranteed, then we will be in even deeper trouble. I therefore feel that the EU should make clear commitments in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cairo Action Programme has pursued important objectives as regards development policy. These are objectives that should, if achieved, improve living conditions in developing countries. Although it deals with an undoubtedly commendable initiative and with an issue that is very complex to deal with, this report does, in my opinion, overlook the principal objective set ten years ago at the Cairo Conference. As shadow rapporteur for our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I do not believe that the urgent issues that we consider to be equally important have been dealt with adequately. These concern the population change in developing countries, that is to say the issues linked to education and access to training, nutritional problems, hygiene problems, economic growth and emigration. Instead, as is largely clear from the document presented by the rapporteur, Mrs Junker, the report focuses almost exclusively on issues concerning reproduction and sexual education, issues that are indeed very important but that do not necessarily have to be separated from a wider context and dealt with in a sterile manner, especially if these statements are not fully in line with the Cairo conclusions. Too many issues were indeed forgotten, issues that were, at the time, instead seen as key aspects of the structural population change in developing countries in future years. In my opinion, this report – which, I remind you, was adopted with 11 votes in favour and seven against in committee – needs to be reconsidered and must, above all, be brought back in line with what was established at the aforementioned Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be consistent with the Action Plan’s objectives, I believe in particular that Recital R b, which stresses the importance and central nature of the family as an element of cohesion and unity in society, must be accepted. Furthermore, I hope, as was strongly suggested by our group, that paragraphs 6, 10, 11, 17, 23 and 26 might be rewritten so that they are more balanced. Moreover, if it is not reworded we cannot accept paragraph 20, which promotes outright abortion without considering national legal frameworks, and it does it specifically through information campaigns in developing countries for safe abortions. There is no doubt that sovereignty must be respected in this sensitive area, as must the ethics of each country, especially in such sensitive issues such as reproductive health and rights concerning reproduction. This is the position of the draftsman, the shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE, Mr Mantovani. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, a few facts. We now know that, every minute, a woman dies for reasons connected with pregnancy. Every minute, 100 abortions are carried out, almost half of them by people with no medical training. Every year, 70 000 women die as a result of unsafe abortions. Every minute, ten people are infected with HIV. Every year, two million girls between the ages of five and fifteen are introduced into the commercial sex market and to a modern form of slavery without protection of a preventative nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Rape and sexual violence are also on the increase in Europe. Girls and women are still exposed to genital mutilation in many countries, something that is unacceptable. Such violation can lead to serious injury and to actual death. One woman in three has been exposed to violence, according to a report recently published by Amnesty.</p>
<p class="contents">In the developing countries, reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement where women of childbearing age are concerned. In Afghanistan, half of all deaths among women aged between 15 and 50 are pregnancy-related. In this situation, to refuse to support organisations that provide contraceptive advice is consciously to collude in a situation in which hundreds of thousands of women undergo unsafe abortions and suffer premature death and one in which hundreds of thousands of women are infected with HIV every year. That is a profound violation of human rights and constitutes a serious risk to women’s reproductive and mental health.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Member States must naturally comply with their obligations and fund and implement the programme of measures from Cairo. In doing so, the EU must make sexual and reproductive health a part of development policy and, of course, demand that the recipient countries ban genital mutilation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I wish to state that we really wanted this report to be about the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, but this is clearly not the case. This is basically a report on sexual and reproductive health, which does not address other important issues raised at the Cairo International Conference. There is total silence, for example, on the issues of economic growth, migration, town planning, the environment and the elderly. Men taking responsibility is mentioned only once and education, which was addressed in a multifaceted way at the Cairo Conference, is referred to only in the context of reproductive health. This is, therefore, simply another report on sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to my second observation: we must define precisely what we mean by the term ‘sexual and reproductive health’ which, without wishing to challenge my fellow Members, is a subject that concerns not only women but men too. We must clarify this concept, which is often abused in international discussions. The definition I propose is that sexual and reproductive health should be understood to mean preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-Aids – a scourge that concerns us all – and guaranteeing women the safe conditions needed for pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. This is the concept that I suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to say a final word about abortion. I agree with the rapporteur when she says that abortion is not a form of contraception. I agree with this and think that this really goes without saying, but this must lead us to conclude that the issue should not be addressed as if abortion were indeed a form of contraception. This is a matter that I feel, furthermore, should be left to the discretion of each country. It is most unfortunate that the European Union should be put in a position of power and could thus be accused of promoting abortion on the international stage and we therefore propose that item nine of recital 20 should be removed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would have expected that by now, ten years later, these rights had advanced further, but unfortunately they have instead come under severe attack. Several people have already mentioned what is known as the Mexico City Policy, which would be unconstitutional in the United States. Withholding US assistance from any organisation that in any way refers to abortion has already significantly increased the risk of unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and death and injury due to unsafe abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the catastrophic consequences of the Mexico City Policy, the worldwide commitment to the ICPD has been waning. Financial commitments have not been met. It is generally recognized that the millennium goals cannot be met without advances in women's reproductive health and rights. The effectiveness of reproductive programmes is still being eroded by a health policy that puts ideology before sound public health practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise that nobody wants to use abortion as a means of family planning. I therefore urge you to vote against Amendment No 12. A number of amendments delete the rights of women, which naturally is totally unacceptable. I urge everybody to adopt this report so that the EU can send a strong signal of commitment to the ICPD. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to use part of this to give my support to the amendments tabled by Mrs Frassoni specifically concerning the campaign against female genital mutilation. This is a campaign that this Parliament has given a great deal of support to, indeed it started it with the help of the Commission, and I must say that there have already been major successes in the African and Arab worlds. Furthermore, I would like our admiration for the Arab and African women to be recorded in at least part of the report. These women are fighting for their rights in their countries, in much more difficult conditions than here, as you can imagine. Today, ten million women have taken to the streets in Mogadishu to fight against female genital mutilation. Across the Arab and African world, extremely courageous women are standing up for their rights. I would like this Parliament to give them a sign of its great support and extremely high regard for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The action programme was well balanced and proved to be a solid basis for action, predominantly on account of the broad basis that was created at the conference. This also gave a tremendous boost to the millennium development objectives that were subsequently formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The past decade has done nothing to make the Cairo objectives less important or less topical. Regrettably, the situation is still not what it should be. Less than half of the agreed financial objectives for donor countries have been met. The position of women has hardly improved in most countries. Participation in primary education, particularly for girls, is way behind the objectives. Far from AIDS being driven back, the progress of the epidemic has not been stemmed. Basic health care and reproductive health care still require major investments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the assessment of Cairo is on the agenda today. However, it is unfortunate, in my view, that this is not taking place in the same spirit as that in which the conclusion was reached ten years ago. The report as it is before us is only an assessment of part of Cairo, while there is still so much to be done in other areas. In my opinion, the report does not do any justice to the programme's generally supportive and broad scope. The report is far too much focused on the albeit very important and very urgent topic of reproductive health, but it is unfortunate that no attention has been given to other important topics which were explicitly addressed in Cairo, including sustainable development, research, education, particularly for women and girls, the role of the extended family and the combating of violence against women. The report also overlooks the agreement that was made in Cairo that every country, as a sovereign power, is responsible for the implementation of the recommendations, consistent with national legislation and development priorities. That is particularly important where ethical issues are concerned. That is why I believe that this is deserving of support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I hope the House will reject the amendments, tabled by some PPE-DE colleagues, to delete all the references to reproductive health rights. Not one PPE-DE speaker has explained what the objection is to the idea of people having sexual and reproductive health rights. We hear much in this House about rights –– shareholder rights –– and I fail to see how they can object to the concept of people having rights in relation to their reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I hope the House will send a strong message to the United States that the Mexico City Policy is unacceptable and should be abandoned. It prevents real aid going to real people on the ground who need access to contraception, family planning and other health services. It is a damaging policy and I hope the European Parliament will convey that message.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I very much support the amendments by Mrs Junker and Mr Bowis on the problem of vaginal fistula. Many of us visited the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia and met women who are affected by this very severe health problem, which has not been dealt with very often in Parliament. It is a serious problem and I hope the European Commission will look into how it can help to fund hospitals and outreach programmes for women affected by it. This is a problem which is totally preventable and by putting some money into it we could stop the unnecessary suffering of women. Since today is International Women's Day, this would be a good message to send, as this is a problem we can do something about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
