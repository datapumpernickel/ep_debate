<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Manuel António dos Santos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> I should like to begin by thanking all the MEPs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the draftsmen of the opinions of the various committees that have delivered opinions on this report for the support and the high-quality contributions that they have provided. I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for his encouragement on various occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we recently heard the Commission President say in Parliament that Europe cannot aspire to speak to the world with one voice on energy policy when, internally, it is utterly incapable of speaking with 27 voices. This is also probably the most important message contained in the report before us, and this message has a clear target: the European Council and the Member States, and the Spring Summit in Brussels on 8 and 9 March is an appropriate date for that message to be heard. The time has therefore come to move from mere statements of intent to action, a change of attitude that must take place now or it will never happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is clearly not the best time for us to go into a detailed analysis of the nature, the causes and the consequences of the various energy crises that we have suffered. The report has much to say on these issues and even if it did not we would all still be able to recall the distinguishing features of each of the four oil crises that the European economy has had to contend with in the past 50 years. It is clear that both from the point of view of the new economic paradigm – what might be termed ‘globalisation’ – and from the political and strategic perspective – what might be termed the ‘absence of multilateralism’ – the situation today is vastly different from what it was in the middle of last century. Yet it is precisely for that reason that we must be intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge that different problems always require different solutions and that the most complex problems require the most ambitious and radical solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that the turbulence we have seen in the energy markets and the volatility of prices has led to slower economic growth and to steeper price rises. It is also unthinkable that these setbacks have not been made worse by intense speculative activity around the price of raw materials in the energy sector. It is obvious that strongly integrated economic areas, as, fortunately, is the case of the EU, are able in the short term to absorb shocks and to pursue their main objectives by implementing their economic policies appropriately. Yet it is also true that the slowdown in the pace of growth and the loss of competitiveness are inevitably reflected in fewer jobs being created; moreover, the current lack of job creation will never be offset by the jobs that may be created in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is made up of Member States with differing growth rates and manufacturing structures, and accordingly their levels of dependency are very different. The difficulties experienced by some Member States will always have to be added to the global difficulties experienced and be paid for by the whole economic and political area to which they belong.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has warned us of an unavoidable outcome unless measures are taken immediately. Europe’s dependency in this sector will increase to unsustainable levels by 2030, and we all know that such dependency will come at a price, in terms of not only the economic impact but also the political and strategic relations that will become entrenched in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of energy is therefore one of central importance for the future of Europe and it is above all a political issue requiring political and Europe-wide responses and commitments. Even the more technical issues, such as the discovery and development of new alternatives and the creation of interlinked regulation systems, can only be successfully addressed if approached from a supranational perspective, without which it will be impossible to mobilise the enormous financial resources needed for research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore suggested that the Union, via its institutions, engage in a global debate on the issue designed to generate interest among the economic agents, the bodies representing the sector and the citizens. It should then go on to assess the true impact of using different energy sources, and the possible combinations thereof, on economic growth, on environmental protection and on reducing the detrimental effect on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, as recent events have shown, the Member States on their own are not in a position to tackle these problems. What is needed is a proper, shared European energy policy, as the Commission has suggested, although that will depend entirely on the Council saying that it wants one. As we know, not only is the EU dangerously dependent on the energy it imports, but it also has not, as a whole, guaranteed the security of production of the energy it needs to meet its objectives of growth and the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Much can be done inside the European area, through energy savings, promoting efficiency, diversifying sources and protecting the environment. Yet the crucial objective can only be achieved via dialogue with all of the other regions of the world, including both those that are predominantly energy producers and those that consume increasing amounts of that energy. The EU’s foreign policy in this new century needs to incorporate the energy dimension as a priority, and for this to be successful it should be based on three essential axes: solidarity with the EU and its structural principles and values, solidarity with developing countries and solidarity with the environmental dimension of the world in which we live and without which we cannot survive.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this report, Parliament will, as on previous occasions, be demonstrating its desire and honouring its responsibility to take action in an area that is essential to the citizens’ well-being, in spite of all the difficulties. We would like to hope that the Spring Summit of the Heads of State or Government is characterised by progress and is not limited to well-meaning statements that do not solve any of the current problems and that only serve to create or store problems for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>I would like to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr dos Santos and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very complete report in terms of its content and it is particularly timely when the European Council of 8 March is about to discuss a broad energy package approved by the Commission in January.</p>
<p class="contents">That package includes a proposal for a global European strategy capable of taking on the challenge of guaranteeing the energy supply while at the same time combating climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that, over recent weeks and months, the oil price has fallen back from maximum levels of close to 80 dollars per barrel, which it reached last summer during the Lebanon crisis, does not mean that the main conclusions and recommendations contained in the report are no longer as relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Those conclusions and recommendations place the emphasis on the structural factors that have led to the recent price levels, or current price levels. These factors are undoubtedly going to remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in view of the growth and inflation figures for 2006, which have been released over recent days, it is worth stressing how well the European economy has reacted in general to the volatility and rises in oil prices this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the concerns expressed in the report with regard to the consequences of the increase in prices, but it is also the case that, over recent months, those consequences have been less serious than we had feared and than those that we have seen in previous cases of sharp increases in oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that should be stressed. It is linked to the debate we held yesterday in this House on the Bullmann and Andersson reports. It is significant that, at a time when the European Council is going to discuss both this energy strategy and climate change package and the Lisbon Strategy, our European economies have experienced a period of sharp oil price increases and that, at the same time, economic growth has sped up without any particularly worrying tensions in prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said yesterday in this House, this is not the result of chance, it is the result of efforts made over recent years to make the functioning of Europe’s markets in goods, services, capital and labour more efficient, and it is the result, beyond the cyclical element of the current economic situation, of the positive results that we are beginning to see thanks to the structural reforms already carried out, and thanks to the budgetary consolidation efforts of recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">This message must reach the citizens loud and clear so that public opinion may be in a position, on the one hand, to appreciate the importance of the efforts that we have asked them to make so far, and, on the other, to better understand and accept the efforts that have still to be made in order to ensure that the improvements that we are now beginning to see become structural improvements and allow us to look to the future with more confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would say once again that this better behaviour of the economy does not make the report and the conclusions and recommendations of the report by Mr dos Santos, in particular, any less relevant in terms of the functioning of the energy market and the impact of energy consumption on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not ignore a series of factors. For example, that Europe’s energy supply is dependent on geopolitical factors, which are not entirely in our hands. For example, that the low level of interconnection of our gas and electricity energy networks makes us more vulnerable to those geopolitical factors and to tensions in supply, such as those we have seen this winter and the winter before.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, that that low level of interconnection, together with other factors of a national nature, make it impossible for a genuine internal energy market to emerge. This harms consumers, who pay more for energy, receive lower quality energy and have less security in terms of receiving that energy at acceptable prices and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Or, for example, that the amount of CO2 that we continue to emit into the atmosphere is exacerbating the greenhouse effect and the consequences of that effect in terms of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the response to the problems and challenges referred to in the report, some elements of which I have just listed, can largely be found in the proposals included in the energy package approved by the Commission in January and which is going to be one of the principal issues to be discussed at the European Council of 8 and 9 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals cover both economic and environmental aspects, security aspects stemming from our energy dependency and proposals to improve the efficiency of energy use. In this regard, I believe that they are essentially in line with the considerations and recommendations contained in the report by Mr dos Santos.</p>
<p class="contents">All we need to do is move on from debate to action. The citizens are aware of the challenges we have to face. At the forthcoming European Council, the Heads of State or Government must now provide the necessary political impetus to implement a genuine European energy strategy such as the one put forward by the Commission in its proposal, and like the one that this Parliament has been calling for repeatedly, in today's report and in other reports and resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I welcome a heightened interest in these issues, but let us please be cautious about trying to solve all issues in the energy field in this report which, as I understand it, is primarily about oil prices and oil volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I would like to make relates to the precedent of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, when a substantial increase in real terms had a big effect on the economy, but the world financial markets coped with those changes and the recessionary effects were relatively short-lived. The increases today in proportion, in real terms, are not as great, and therefore should not give us such concern.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new are the different suppliers in the marketplace, and in particular Russia and the Russian policy on this matter. I have great confidence in the markets. I think that they will cope with changes in demand in the foreseeable future, but that is a very short period of time and our concerns should be more about security of supply; about getting enough supply, whether it is within Europe or imported; about a depletion of reserves; and about the sustainability angle, with reference to climate change and our emissions. Those are very important and we must remember that we do have alternatives to oil, but we need to develop them to a marketable stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very cautious about trying to increase the proportion of oil stocks from 90 to 120 days. I do not think 30 days more will make any difference. This House voted strongly against a proposal from the Commission to that effect in the last Parliament. I wonder whether our main concern is really fear about price changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is undisputable. It would be going too far to speak of a recession, however, as the rapporteur would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is one year old, and I am very much obliged to Mr dos Santos for incorporating our contributions into the report now present. This means that we have eliminated all our differences on this and acted according to the state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to this subject, what we need is not heated debates, but rather a sober analysis. The oil price increase has naturally led to certain increases in production costs. Yet it is wrong to assume a direct link between energy prices and competitiveness on this account. After all – as the Commissioner has just said – the increase in the price of fossil fuels has been universal, and thus the competitive starting position of our competitors has been equally affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Oil prices are calculated in US dollars. In this connection, I warmly welcome the fact that the European Central Bank is proceeding with caution in monetary matters whilst remaining vigilant. Yet it must be borne in mind that rising oil prices promise oil-producing companies an increase in profit. This, in turn, leads to the development of more areas, to increased supply and ultimately to a fall in prices – which is what we have seen in the last six months. If the situation in Iraq were more peaceful, the uncertainties in Iran removed and the Caspian Sea oil flowing, the outlook for the medium term would be better.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we improve the organisation of our energy supply in future? This will be discussed shortly – with our participation – and an objective analysis will help in this discussion. As we know, Europe relies heavily on fossil fuels – of which there are few sources in Europe – and so it is desirable to develop renewable energies. Developing these at all costs, however, will have the same negative impact as rising oil prices, as the cost of these new technologies will be passed on to the final consumer. This will mean less money in the Member States’ coffers for other fields.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more investment in research and development to make renewable energy supplies more competitive and ready for the market. In terms of the energy issue, this is the only course of action that will help the European economy. If I may make an additional comment on the medium-term outlook: the situation regarding China will become clear in the medium term. Looking at the progression of its economy, particularly the automobile industry, China will need as much energy for its cars by 2030 as is being produced today. This means that we need new technical possibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the dos Santos report points us in the right direction. Obviously, we must focus on the economic problems, but the main point that I would like to stress is that, ultimately, these economic problems lead to social problems. For many countries this oil price crisis has ultimately led to a greater financial burden on those who can least shoulder it. I would like to quote Malta's case as an example, where the authorities' lack of planning has led to a 45% surcharge on water and electricity bills. I also believe that we must start thinking outside the box and look beyond the framework we have been confined to up until now. These new prices have led to certain solutions that until recently did not make any economic sense. However, now they do make sense and we must pay more attention to them than we did previously. We must therefore concentrate on the root of the problem rather than on its effects. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rising price of energy is pushed up further by the increased requirement for energy resources of new major market participants, especially China. Furthermore, energy resources are made more expensive by the increased cost of their production, and by the geopolitical instability of petroleum-exporting regions. Rising costs are also influenced by Russia's policy of using energy as an instrument for exerting economic and political pressure on its trading partners. This year, world petroleum prices have increased by almost 15%. In addition to the factors I have already mentioned, other influencing factors were the OPEC decision to reduce petroleum production, and unexpectedly cold weather in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the report, energy price increases, as an external factor, caused repercussions in the economies of various EU countries, both in the euro zone and among the new member countries. My country, Lithuania, whose economy depends very much on the import of energy resources, exceeded the Maastricht inflation criterion by 0.07% due to an unexpected rise in energy prices and, therefore, failed to become a member of the euro zone, as it was hoping to do from the beginning of this year. Increases in the cost of energy resources cannot really be predicted, and this will have an influence on the possible admission dates of candidates to the euro zone, apparently pushing them further into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we just observe the influence of rising energy costs on the EU economy or do we need to draw conclusions from it? If the price increases were sudden and unexpected, and objective, then why are just the member countries being blamed for the consequences? Europe only started talking about a common energy policy after the Ukraine-Russia crisis of 2006. The conflict between Belarus and Russia at the beginning of this year over natural gas and petroleum appears to be successfully resolved for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pleasing that the report contains a whole chapter urging Europe to act now and invest in innovation, the energy infrastructure, renewable forms of energy, technology platforms and a transition to clean energy. I am of the opinion that, given the energy situation in the EU and the world, and our concern not just about the prices but also about the influence on climate change, we should also discuss the use of safe nuclear energy as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Euratom this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The author of the report urges that the greatest priority be given to the creation of an energy market for Europe proper and the Mediterranean basin. What is 'Europe proper'? What ever happened to neighbourhood policy, embracing cooperation not only with Mediterranean countries but also with the eastern neighbours of the EU? Why is the European Union negotiating with Russia, trying to arrange a new Treaty of Cooperation between the EU and Russia? Do we decline to accept Russian petroleum and natural gas since we do not have a common EU energy market? I believe that the new eastern EU member countries find the author’s narrow view unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, I welcome the contribution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which expressed its opinion extremely clearly and supported the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we disagree, including in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is on the speculative aspect that has been added to this Structural Fund. From that point of view, I very much endorse the words of Mrs Budreikaitė, and hope that she can persuade her group to withdraw the amendment disputing the speculative element on the volatility of the price of energy. We need to take measures to combat volatility. We must at least eliminate the speculative element of movements in the price of energy, and are capable of so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we must be aware of the particularly serious impact of the structural rise in the price of oil. A grass is invading the planet, namely the African palm, a cereal crop used in biofuel or biodiesel production, which will lead to the price of food being linked to the price of energy. This is an unacceptable risk that we cannot afford to run.</p>
<p class="contents">For years we have been wondering how to ensure that workers do not suffer from the second wave of the effects of oil on the cost of living. If, by dint of an extraordinary misfortune, the policy of developing biofuels were to lead to competition with food production policy, the result would certainly be a link between the price of food and the price of energy, and that would be the most terrible disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We will in fact get to the point where we reserve our oil, but will we do it far-sightedly and voluntarily or because prices force us? What will decide the question? Well, the answer lies in the way we support European R&amp;D and the way we scale up European production of alternatives, not in the way we take alternative oils from other countries.</p>

Many families and households across Europe are now feeling the negative consequences of high energy prices, and the prospect that prices will remain high in the foreseeable future is resulting in fundamental economic changes.</p>

That type of solution, and the harmonisation of provisions, so typical of Union bureaucracy, neither fosters improved competition, nor does it help to eliminate the differences between European countries. Instead of working on raising prices, the European Commission would be better employed supporting alternative sources of energy, energy saving technologies and renewable sources of energy.

In the course of the present debate on European energy policy there are frequent mentions of the noble goal, also contained in the report: within the next few years the European Union must complete its own internal energy market. There is, however, one vital prerequisite for this to happen: that a healthy, undistorted competition should govern the markets within individual Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the recent sector review by the European Commission demonstrates that the European energy market is made up of over-centralised national markets. The old monopolies are still such dominant players today that they dictate or at least strongly influence prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hungary in the 1990s, the incumbent MVM Company Ltd. and the newly privatised electric energy producers signed long-term electricity purchase agreements. These agreements, due to expire between 2010 and 2020, cover about 80% of the Hungarian electrical energy production market, thereby seriously hampering the liberalisation of the market and keeping consumer prices unreasonably high. The price that MVM pays most generating plants for the contracted energy supply seems considerably higher than the wholesale price MVM would pay if power generating plants had to compete with each other. The legal provision for renegotiating these agreements has not led to any result so far, and so the unsatisfactory functioning of the energy market continues to cause serious disadvantages to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a real internal energy market is crucially important for reaching the goals of Europe’s energy policy. Free market competition reduces costs for citizens and businesses, promotes energy efficiency, encourages investment and also contributes to supply security. All Member States must therefore dismantle market impediments without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The development of the internal market for energy has not eliminated existing distortions, as demonstrated by the Commission’s inquiry into the sector. Accordingly, Community regulation of this market needs to be improved by monitoring existing production and distribution structures, and strengthening links between countries. These are some of the conditions that must be in place if we are to increase efficiency in the energy market. It is crucial that the energy efficiency plan recently put forward by the Commission be adopted, as it addresses all of these issues.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that we will continue to talk about energy and we will continue to talk about it in direct relation to climate change and the strategy required to combat it. Energy policy cannot be separated from environmental policy. They form part of the same strategy. I believe that from a debate such as today’s, and other debates that we have held and that we will continue to hold on these issues, today’s more focussed on prices, others on other important aspects of this strategy, the conclusion is — at least this is my conclusion, and I believe that the majority of Members of this Parliament will agree with me — that action at European level, a common European policy, is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a field in which European-level action demonstrates, when it is discussed, and will demonstrate, when we communicate it to the citizens, the added value of European Union action for the coming years and decades. From the point of view of security of supply, from the point of view of the sustainability required of any policy in the field of energy, and from the point of view of the quest for greater competitiveness within a context in which energy prices are unfortunately not going to be as low as they have been in the past, from all points of view, action at European Union-level is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore conclude this debate, Madam President, by joining in the appeal that many of you have made this morning for more decisive action, firstly by the European Council of 8 March and, on that basis, by all of the European institutions, to achieve objectives such as those laid out in the report by Mr dos Santos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also reflects our economy’s excessive dependence on oil, the price of which has shot up whilst the prices of other forms of energy have remained stable or have risen by less.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of a complex situation and effect a political response revolving around the following points. The first is the emergence of European energy leaders, because they alone are capable of negotiating on an equal footing with our main suppliers for the benefit of our Member States. They must be able to go on concluding long-term contracts so as to secure supplies and to cushion heavy investment. Finally, they must not be weakened by the recommending of all-out separation of assets as a factor of competitiveness in the market. Such separation does not make for competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is promotion of a genuine energy mix based on renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, energy efficiency and increased budgets for research into the energies of the future such as ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparing for the post-oil era, these policies will enable the Union to remain competitive while ensuring generally affordable energy supplies for its economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
