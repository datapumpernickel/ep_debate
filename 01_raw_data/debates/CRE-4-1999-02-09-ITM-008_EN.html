<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martin, Philippe‐Armand </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the common organisation of the market in wine is certainly the most complex of all the COMs because it includes not only aspects relating to vineyard management and conditions of grape production but also all rules concerning oenological practices – the processing of wine – as well as rules on labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">The very structure of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product. In the time I have been allocated I am not going to present all of the 248 amendments that are included in my report and that are the result of a vote in committee on almost 600 amendments tabled by all Members. I would like at this stage of my presentation to thank firstly all the officials in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and all those colleagues who made my task easier for me and enabled me to draw up a coherent report.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the central themes of my report? Firstly, a significant number of amendments concern the decision‐making procedure. The Commission, in its proposal, wanted to have sole authority to change the rules. In my report we have asked that the procedure known as the Article 43 procedure be reinstated, so that the Council takes decisions on the basis of proposals from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament. I personally believe that this procedure, although cumbersome, will allow us to preserve specific rules for wine, promoting its status as an agricultural product. In view of wine imports from third countries and the intentions that some people have, as we well know, European wine must retain its status as a local, quality product. In this connection, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment which I had put forward, prohibiting the vinification of musts imported from third countries. If this proposal is accepted by the Council, in the form in which we adopted it, the quality image of European wines will be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structure, the Committee on Agriculture adopted the principle of the right to growth, by an increase of 3 % in the vineyard, while preserving restrictions on planting. Vineyards with an expanding market will be able to obtain other rights on condition that the Member States and, where appropriate, their regions genuinely monitor them. This was what led us to adopt a specific amendment on maintaining the rules on the computerised vineyard register.</p>
<p class="contents">The duration of planting rights has been extended to allow the land to be rested as necessary. Other structural measures were adopted concerning the renewal and regeneration of the vineyard. We have also included measures relating to the vinification tool. If we finance measures allowing the quality of the grape to be improved, the vinification tool must also be adapted so that the wine will be of good quality. Finally, the Committee on Agriculture, concerned about the future of the wine‐growing profession, wanted all structural measures taken to give priority to young wine growers, either on their establishment or during the period when their holdings are growing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of market management we wanted to set up distillation for the purpose of supplying potable alcohol so that European viticulture can preserve its own market. Moreover, as far as crisis distillation is concerned, we have adopted an amendment specifying that it should be compulsory rather than optional, on condition that it targets only those regions and products in which there is a surplus. Budgetary reasons and considerations of fairness argue in favour of our position. With regard to producer organisations, the committee has changed the Commission"s proposal only slightly. Nevertheless, it has deleted measures extending their powers and has reserved the tasks given to them for its members alone.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the interbranch organisations, which we have called ‘trade organisations", we have completely changed the Commission"s proposal, which seemed to us to be more suited to the fruit and vegetable sector. At my request and at the request of the chairman of our committee, Mr Colino Salamanca, the European Parliament"s Directorate‐General for Research carried out a study analysing the role of trade organisations in the wine‐growing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I must commend the excellent work carried out under the leadership of Mr Ramsay and Mr Angelidis, which led to the drafting of Article 42 setting out the principle of delegation of powers and the role of trade organisations. I believe that the amendment we have adopted takes all interests into account, those of the producer Member States and the non‐producer Member States, while preserving all the rules on competition and the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to oenological practices, we have adopted amendments allowing the reintegration of all Community legislation currently in force. We are wary within the committee of implementing regulations that could turn out to be much too lax. Finally, with regard to inspections, we wanted to establish a Community inspectorate that has sufficient manpower and is responsible for checking whether inspectors in the Member States are applying Community provisions fairly and consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude on my report, I would like to make it clear that as rapporteur I will be voting in favour of all the amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture, with the exception of Amendment No 121, which is inconsistent with Amendment No 124. I feel it is necessary to preserve the production of marc, such as Burgundy marc or Gewürztraminer marc, and for this reason I will be voting in favour of Amendment No 124 and against Amendment No 121. Some Members have also tabled amendments, and I will vote in favour of those which follow the line taken in my report, as adopted in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I will be voting in favour of Amendments Nos 250 and 251 by Mr Arias Cańete, Amendments Nos 256, 257, 259, 261 and 268 by the GUE Group, Amendment No 273 by the ARE Group and the Green Group, and Amendment No 274 by the ARE Group and the I‐EDN Group. I will not be voting for Amendment No 249 because we cannot know how the potable alcohol market will develop. I will also be voting against Amendments Nos 252, 253, 260, 262, 264, 265, 266, 267 and 269, which are contrary either to the principle adopted by the committee of maintaining the status quo on enrichment and dry sugaring or to other amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Görlach </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to Mr Martin. By putting in a great deal of work and showing a great willingness to compromise, the rapporteur has successfully produced a good compromise between the individual regions of Europe – which are of course also reflected within our group. I emphasise that it is a good compromise. Sometimes, of course, if there is no prospect of a result, compromises are hastily stitched together, simply to paper over the problems for the time being. That is not the case here! That is why I am very grateful to Mr Martin.</p>
<p class="contents">Where wine growing in the European Union is concerned, we must make sure above all that the wine and the regions in which the wine is produced are not seen solely from the point of view of the end product. It really makes a difference whether I see the wine – be it directly from the wood or in the bottle – just as a product, or whether I see the whole culture and the whole region behind it, and how it is part of the landscape. I therefore believe that it is worthwhile for Europe to take special care of its wine. It is at this point – and I may be speaking on behalf of my group, but I do come from a northern Member State – that I should like to thank Mr Martin, because he has shown a feel for the peculiarities of wine growing, for how wine‐growing traditions and also oenological practices have developed – over centuries, almost – and because his proposals have made it possible for us actually to forget the dispute we had for a very long time between northern, southern and central Europe. Problems will remain, and new ones will arise. When I think of the amount of rectified concentrated grape must which is coming into the European Union in increasing quantities from outside, it seems that we will also have to call on the Commission to be watchful here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is particularly positive that flexibility is being preserved where new planting rights are concerned, and that a fair compromise has been found here. It was decided to increase the area under vines by 3 % by 2010. Although many would have liked to have seen more, for others this already goes too far. On distillation, the approach – which is the same as that adopted by the Commission – is absolutely right, namely that we need to cut back on compulsory distillation and that here too we need to introduce a little more market, but that we should keep compulsory distillation as an instrument, to be used in the future where it proves to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly positive initiative, both in the Commission proposals and in the proposals which we discussed and adopted in committee, is the specific and rather privileged – because it is necessary – support for young producers. Anything which is important in terms of actively supporting young farmers is particularly important where young wine producers are concerned. I should like to say, even at this early stage, that of course my group wishes to support the rapporteur in his efforts to maintain the compromise reached in the committee and to examine with due care all the amendments which could unravel that compromise. There are a number of amendments which are in the spirit of the compromise, but there are also a whole series of amendments which could destroy it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group would like to support it, to make it possible for the considerable amount of work which we did in the committee with Mr Martin to be crowned with a large majority at the vote in Parliament. The Commission supports this, and the Council would be well advised to take this good compromise produced by Parliament as the basis for its deliberations, because it has in fact failed to make a start on these negotiations for at least the last three years.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Langen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I too should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and his colleagues, because they have produced a very good piece of work. This new Commission proposal has taken us down a different path from the one we took in 1994 and 1995. At that time, Parliament was split. The proposal, Commissioner Fischler, was also not nearly as good as this one. Circumstances have changed in some respects, while in others they have remained the same. Compared with the 1980s, surpluses have tended to decrease. Unfortunately, per capita consumption has fallen in the main producer countries, Italy and France. As a result of the GATT round, we have new competitors in the quality wine sector, a fact which we have borne in mind, and this is where we have made real progress under the leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Martin: in this Parliament, we have finally accepted the special regional characteristics of wine growing in the north and south of Europe. That is where the real progress has been made. That is why my group, the PPE, has not, as a group, tabled any amendments to the Agriculture Committee"s proposal and against Mr Martin"s compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to outline briefly why we have acted in this way. I believe that in this new proposal, we have successfully put right what was wrong with the old organisation of the market in wine. Take the subject of distillation for a start. Compulsory distillation has not proved its worth. It is right to make it voluntary. On the other hand, it is also right – and that is why we have also voted in favour of various compromises – for the potable alcohol market to have a guaranteed supply of wine, for example for cognac, brandy and other products which are traditional regional specialities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for the very first time we have a legal base for producer associations and trade organisations. We want to make this rather less complicated than it is in the Commission proposal. That is why we support the Agriculture Committee"s call for a framework regulation. There is – we have agreed in our group – just one point on which we wish to depart from the compromise. This relates to the first indent of Amendment No 179. Mr Martin, we have agreed that we want to settle the issue of compulsory packaging in the area of production – as previously discussed – in the Lulling report and not now, and that we want, above all, to wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice on this issue. We will be voting against the first indent at that point.</p>
<p class="contents">On all the other issues, however, we have supported reasonable compromises, on the status quo for saccharose, on oenological procedures and on diverse traditions. I believe that overall we can vote in favour of this draft report. For the first time, Parliament has the opportunity to speak with one voice on this very controversial issue and thus – and most importantly – to influence the Commission and the Agriculture Council.</p>

I also feel that the Commission"s proposal, though initially valid, has nevertheless been substantially improved by Parliament"s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Wine growing and wine making naturally take place in certain specific areas with a long tradition of growing vines, areas where replacing vines with other crops would prove difficult. The producers have years of experience in making wine and it is traditional to drink wine. Wine used to be almost the only alcoholic drink consumed by the local people. However, as a result of the so‐called globalisation of society, the situation has changed dramatically in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">This COM seeks to bring production into line with market demand, and in that respect, I believe it is a positive move. I feel it is helpful to allow a slight increase in new planting, and also welcome the measures designed to allow new young growers to become involved in this traditional process.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to discuss the various methods of wine making, some of which have long been established in certain Member States. Each area has its own way of making wine.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers, however, are a key element of our society and certainly deserve consideration. It is not enough simply to put the wine on the market. A certain amount of information is called for, together with research into the beneficial effects of wine and education in the sensible consumption of this product. Wine does have a beneficial effect on health, and should be considered as a food. Wine and health is a nice phrase, but we cannot just depend on tradition. It is up to the producers" associations to make information available to the consumers.</p>

<p class="contents">The difference lies in the nature of the Commission"s proposal. The proposal put before us early in the present legislature was based on what I would call an apocalyptic vision of anticipated surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission"s view, the only way of pre‐empting such a situation was the mass destruction of vines. Fortunately, the ensuing proposal gave rise to such opposition within the Council that the matter was shelved.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years later, the situation is radically different due to the fact that the proposal put forward by the Commission is so unlike the previous one. Reality is stubborn. Five years have gone by and the much‐feared structural surpluses have not materialised. The Commission"s draconian proposals therefore no longer make sense. It is worth pointing out that proposals of this nature abound in the Commission when reforms affecting mainly the southern Member States are at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of crucial importance to us today, however, are the rigour and quality expected from research undertaken by the Commission in its role as the institution charged with putting forward legislative proposals. This is of key importance when what is at stake is the whole package of agricultural reforms contained in Agenda 2000. Often, problems can arise not only from research undertaken but also from what is omitted or has not been done.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the Commission"s present proposals will not have the negative consequences of the 1992 reform as far as the grubbing up of vines and the loss of agricultural jobs are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Martin"s report, I must congratulate him on the excellent work he has carried out. His report is coherent and this is particularly commendable as he has had to deal appropriately with a great many amendments. I would, however, like to highlight – and I know he will not take it amiss – a fundamental problem which remains unresolved. It appears that the use of sucrose for enrichment will continue to be permitted. A valuable opportunity to replace sucrose with concentrated musts might therefore be lost. Replacing sucrose with must would be in line with traditional practice and would allow wine making to be based entirely on the vineyard.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Martin, I should like to remind you of a visit you made to my country, and to thank you for having taken the trouble to go there and to meet with the agricultural organisations. I am most grateful to you for doing so, and feel that some good has come from it.</p>

But if Dionysus has helped us to reach agreement, so much the better! The truth is that Philippe‐Armand Martin"s report, while defending the <span class="italic">status quo</span> , also manages to modernise and adapt it to the new circumstances of the globalised market, to make it flexible and to free it from the Commission's inherent <span class="italic">dirigiste </span> tendency. It places the onus on Member States, producer organisations and committees of viticultural experts, and increases the responsibility of both producers and Member States" governments.</p>
<p class="contents">It also takes into account the need to increase our wine production, market conditions permitting, but at the same time to ensure that this is achieved through greater cooperation between the Member States. I have no doubt that very simple measures are called for, such as reliable registers, something that does not exist right now. We must also prevent the fraudulent use of concentrated must, for example, and in our negotiations with certain third countries we should apply a very low tolerance threshold about the fraud practised in those countries. As for compulsory distillation, we should be more flexible. And this implies greater responsibility on the part of whoever decides whether or not to distil, on the basis of market fluctuations. But arbitrary, senseless compulsory distillation should not be the rule. Another important point is to respect oenological identities, regional oenological practices, and to avoid pointless squabbles: I have to say that I am sick and tired of arguments that frankly have not improved relations among European wine growers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important – and I must confess that this is an extremely sensitive area for Portugal – to look at the issues of bottling in the region of origin, of accountability, and of quality wines, which are products with a considerable international reputation. We therefore disagree with Amendments Nos 171 and 179 and we, or at least the Members closest to me, will be voting against them. Otherwise I think this is an extremely positive report because we have avoided consensus for consensus" sake but have reached a proper agreement. That is what is of interest: consensus for its own sake is little short of treachery but an agreement is a contract in everyone's interest.</p>

Distillation and the grubbing‐up premium are typical end‐of‐pipe solutions. They actually ought to be abolished, because distillation is an invitation to produce massive quantities of lower‐quality wine, and the grubbing‐up premium encourages the transfer of production from regions which are problematic in terms of labour costs, but important in terms of regional culture, to rationalised, export‐driven production. We will only counter overproduction by introducing comprehensive new quality criteria. I would caution against the belief that here too genetic engineering can be of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to retain the historical lands developed and cultivated by man and to safeguard an appropriate income for wine growers. In the long term, quality is the only way this can be achieved. I am particularly concerned about this, because I believe that we will only be able to defend our European viniculture at the next WTO round if we are able to throw something into the ring related to the environment, social policy and quality, because the Americans would like to have our designation of origin off the negotiating table and to negotiate about brand names instead. That would mean that Coca‐Cola could buy the Bordeaux name and then resell the cheapest wines in the world under that name. But that is not what we want! We must therefore have good arguments to explain why designation of origin needs to consist of more than alcohol content, quality grade and colour.</p>
<p class="contents">The much vaunted EU model of agriculture will only carry weight and have any substance if we are able to designate regional, social and environmental characteristics for each wine and thus also enter into the negotiations on the offensive. We support Mr Martin"s report and we say one thing: quality not quantity!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Chesa </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like very much to thank our rapporteur Philippe Martin for his excellent report which takes account of all Europe"s vineyards.</p>
<p class="contents">I was there when, at the beginning of August, Mr Martin met viticulture and trade representatives of the Languedoc‐Roussillon region in the town hall at Carcassonne. I was pleased to note that their principal demands were included both in the report and in the vote in the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these principal demands? With regard to wine‐growing potential, we must preserve the principle of limiting rights by providing for the right to growth of 3 % in the short term, with the possibility of updating this in line with market needs once a proper inventory of planting rights has been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to improving vineyards, I must stress the importance of this structural component. As an elected representative of the biggest wine‐growing region in Europe, whose vineyards have undergone considerable renewal, I can assure you, Commissioner, that quality is essential for the future of viticulture.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have asked that the whole of the ‘reconversion" component should allow regeneration of the vineyard and vinification tools. All of these structural measures, both in terms of wine‐growing potential and vineyard improvement, must give priority to young wine growers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as market management is concerned, we must maintain compulsory distillation of by‐products, apart from existing derogations. The alcohols produced must be suitable for the potable alcohol market in order to reduce the budgetary cost of this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">As for crisis distillation, in order to be efficient this must remain compulsory only in the regions in which there is a surplus.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to authorisation in the sector, the tasks and responsibilities of the producer groups have to be recognised even though the rules cannot be extended. I therefore consider the report as adopted in the Committee on Agriculture to be perfectly suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to oenological practices, we must draw up an exhaustive list of authorised practices and preserve the principle of status quo, including in aid for enrichment using concentrated musts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to draw your attention to Amendment No 274 on the production of natural sweet wines. Here too we need to maintain a list of compulsory information to be given on the labels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, with regard to trade with third countries, we must keep in place the current rules prohibiting vinification of musts from third countries. If this ban is lifted, as the Commission proposes, there is a danger that the image of wines produced in the European Union will be considerably damaged and that there will be an actual reduction in quality, which is inconsistent with the objectives of the COM.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must just mention the procedure proposed by the Commission both for managing planting rights and for labelling oenological practices and market management measures. Contrary to the Commission proposals, we must preserve the current procedure known as the Article 43 procedure.</p>

<p class="contents">It is essentially a question of ensuring that wine remains a more strictly defined agricultural product, banning imports of musts from third countries, allowing vineyards to increase in size in line with market demand, maintaining the status quo on oenological practices – including dry sugaring – and having compulsory crisis distillation only in regions where there is a surplus. As the text does not specifically mention natural sweet wines, I, along with several other Members, tabled Amendment No 274 in order to refer to them expressly, which is essential if we are to adhere to our common aim of respecting the diversity of the ‘<span class="italic">terroirs</span> " which give European wines their quality and individuality.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Martin, I shall be tabling two or three amendments, for example on GMO, in the hope that this new wording will be acceptable to the rapporteur and to all the Members.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we have been dealing with this wine dossier for six years now, which shows how important – or even doubly important – it is. It is important firstly because our wine growers are important. They account for 7 % of agricultural GDP and only 2.5 % of budgetary expenditure, which means that wine growers bring in a lot of revenue and cost very little. It is important also for the economy in general because viticulture is a key item in our balance of trade. Moreover, on the issue of the balance of trade, Commissioner, I fear that your proposal is rather putting us at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We know what the Commission proposal involves. It is based, as always in the field of agriculture, on the fallacy of overproduction. According to you, by the year 2000 we would have produced 180 million hectolitres of wine. We would consume 150 million of these, leaving a surplus of 30 million hectolitres of wine. Hence the measures you proposed in 1993: early harvests, wine quotas, in short, all the extreme measures that we know so well.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, today we know that in 1998 the figures balanced and you agreed to compromise. Technically, therefore, there were positive changes. But I believe that, beneath the surface, the Commission"s negative attitudes remain.</p>
<p class="contents">I will look firstly at the positive changes. It is true that from the Sierra Bardaji report in 1993 to the Fantuzzi report in 1998, and now the Martin report, we have succeeded by means of amendments – 600 in this case – in improving the situation: amendments on distillation, which is now compulsory, amendments on new planting rights of 3 %, on regeneration of vineyards, on rest periods for the land, on potable alcohols, on aid for concentrated must – and not merely for the CIII zones, which worried my wine growers in Languedoc‐Roussillon and those of Raymond Chesa – amendments also on inspectors, as we had only two inspectors for the whole of Europe, and perhaps even on interbranch organisations, which go back to Maréchal Pétain and are supported by the Left. But that is not the important point. We may even have made progress in the religious war on dry sugaring.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I fear that other more sinister attitudes are lurking beneath these technical concessions. There are four, as far as I can see: Malthusianism, fundamentalism, internationalism and dehumanisation. With regard to Malthusianism, firstly, as is the case with meat, cereal, milk and even coal and steel, you only ever have one management instrument: a drastic cut in supply. You never look into developing demand. It is true that we must prepare for the opening of the wine market to the East, with the arrival of Hungarian, Romanian and Bulgarian wines, and even the World Trade Organisation in the year 2000, with our Australian, Californian and South African friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentalism in this case is the fiscal anti‐wine fundamentalism of Northern Europe, with 3 euros in excise duty on each litre of wine in Denmark and the United Kingdom. It is the health fundamentalism that is seen in Sweden and Finland, where they are lax about drugs but puritans when it comes to alcohol, even though wine is a health product with positive cardiovascular effects, to say nothing of the mental effects of beer‐drinking seen in the hooligans at Heisel.</p>
<p class="contents">Internationalism is the six million hectolitres of imports, a tenth of a euro in customs duties and the famous concentrated musts from third countries that you were preparing to authorise. Fortunately, the Commission was able to resist. All that was needed to perfect this internationalism was to authorise wines in bulk and not to authorise bottling in the region of production. This brings me to the fourth and final undesirable effect, that of dehumanisation, which would make wine an industrial product rather than an agricultural one. This is the source of the conflict between the beer‐drinkers of Northern Europe and the wine‐drinkers elsewhere in Europe, and I fear this must affect the balance in the Council of Ministers. But I would suggest to the House that if there had ever been vines in Saudi Arabia this would have changed the strategic face of the world. I fear there must be some complicity here between the fundamentalism of the North and the fundamentalism of the South, since neither of them drink wine.</p>
