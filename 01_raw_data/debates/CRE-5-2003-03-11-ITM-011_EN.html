<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, at the beginning of my speech on this report, to thank three groups of people: firstly, and especially, the representatives of the Spanish and Danish Presidencies. The Spanish Presidency made the common position possible, and the Danish Presidency worked hard at seeking dialogue with us. I am also glad and grateful that, in the last week, the Greek Presidency has set aside its self-imposed ban on engaging in talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein’s political staff and secretariat for their constant readiness to engage in discussions with us and to work with us on reaching compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Kuckelkorn and Mr Huhne, together with my committee colleagues, who were extremely flexible and who conducted themselves in such a way as consistently to help us bring about this directive without our having to jettison the principles we laid down at first reading. I should like to thank them most sincerely for their contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make is that this directive has also clearly shown the problems we have where legislative procedure is concerned. In October 2000, we received the Commission proposal; and Parliament concluded the first reading in July 2001; but it was not until 5 November 2002 that the common position was made known to us. Today we have the second reading debate, and tomorrow the vote. As this needs to be recalled to mind, I would take this opportunity to state very clearly that we wanted to show our ability to conclude such an important directive at first reading. Parliament’s first reading produced 458 votes in favour. If the Council had accepted this gesture of cooperation on our part, we should already have had this directive long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point, which I make partly in response to a number of today’s press reports, is that this directive is neither a pensions directive nor a directive concerned with social insurance products. Nor does it just have to do with occupational retirement provision. As its name suggests, it is a directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision. That needs to be stated, because we are concerned here with a financial services directive. That being said, many wishes have of course been expressed to me in terms of defining the benefits, designing the products, and so on. When they hear the words ‘occupational retirement provision’, people ask what the benefits are for themselves at a time of prevailing uncertainty in all the Member States where pensions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the financial services and internal market directives, together with the relevant institutions, play a key role in the funding of the European economy and the operation of capital markets, we have tried, in this highly charged situation, to follow the path laid down in Lisbon and to bring about not only competition but also a corresponding degree of social security. We also had the task of structuring occupational pension schemes as the second pillar of retirement provision and of dealing with the social aspects of this.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is a success for the European Parliament. We amended the Commission proposal at first reading. At second reading, we shall amend the common position along lines that reflect our own thinking. This directive is not the end product. It is a first step. I believe that the directive will be of benefit to people because there will be more suppliers in competition with one another; that, with the creation of the European market, it will have more advantages for people on the move; that it will have more advantages for citizens and suppliers because the second pillar too will now be regulated on a European basis; and that it will benefit the capital market by moving sums to the tune of EUR 2 000 billion around the market and hopefully increasing that capital. The directive will be of benefit to the internal market due to the provision of venture capital, and it will be of benefit to the institutions because European regulations will exist, so making cross-border activities easier.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made amendments to six items as a matter of priority. The amount of information to be given to recipients of pensions has been increased. The biometric risks have been clearly formulated, and it has been made possible to cover these. It has been clearly specified that our objective is life-long pensions, which must be at the heart of our arrangements. The directive will lead to coordination of the work of the supervisory authorities, and it has laid the foundations for a level playing field. It has still not liberalised the assessment stipulations. Given the Council’s position, that was not possible. Nor has the directive clarified the issue of tax harmonisation, and it has still not fulfilled our desire to see the second pillar structured in the same way throughout Europe, so providing for greater social security.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is an important step in the right direction, however. I believe we have maintained the balance within the framework of our competences and the existing options. I should like most sincerely to thank all those who have contributed to the work.</p>

The rapporteur has been so kind as to thank my cabinet and my services. I am duly grateful for those compliments and shall certainly pass them on to my staff. I thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for their judicious and efficient handling of this important file and for their very constructive and cooperative attitude during this second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is of particular strategic importance, not just for our capital markets, but also for our labour markets and perhaps, more importantly, for the sustainability of our public finances and our pension systems as a whole. This directive has clearly been identified as a priority by Heads of State and Government, notably at the Barcelona European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation in Europe is characterised by three aspects: first, a growing general awareness of what I would describe as the ‘demographic timebomb’; second, a clear determination by all Member States to address the financial challenges without undermining the social objective of their pension systems; third, a strong desire by the Member States to preserve the specificity of the pension systems in their efforts to modernise them. After all, the responsibility for designing and managing pension systems remains with the Member States and there is no intention of changing that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that background that our efforts to create an internal market framework for the institutions offering occupational pensions must be considered. A directive aimed at creating a prudential framework for pension funds must fit in with this process of steady but gradual and coordinated reform of national pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive must also - and this has been of fundamental importance for the Commission - fully respect two essential principles: first, full respect for the very wide diversity of the occupational retirement business among Member States and, second, non-interference in the organisation of Member States’ pensions systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to note that the package of compromise amendments tabled by the PPE-DE, Socialist and Liberal groups fully complies with those two principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Purvis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Karas, who has shown superb judgement in reaching a broadly acceptable balance in this complex but vitally important directive. Our group was very concerned at any possibility of the directive failing for lack of consensus in Parliament or between Parliament and the Council. But the rapporteur has very successfully squared this very difficult circle. We in the PPE-DE Group are very pleased to support the compromise which the rapporteur and the Commissioner have engineered.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, flag up some residual concerns which we still have. For example, compromise Amendments 4 and 12 give Member States the right to provide an option for coverage of biometric risks. Certainly this is only an option, but we are concerned that differences between Member States might in any way impede cross-border occupational pension funds and the ability to transfer employees together with their pension funds around the European Union. I would appreciate the Commissioner's reassurance as to his understanding of the impact - or hopefully non-impact - of this option.</p>
<p class="contents">The other concern regards the requirement for a register which also has to show in which Member States the institution concerned is operating. The rapporteur has assured me that, under the agreed amendment, no such register would be required if instead the institutions were 'authorised'. Again I would appreciate the Commissioner's specific assurance that this is also his understanding. This would certainly be welcome to the financial services industry with a view to eliminating unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these two matters, we are very pleased with the outcome which provides ample flexibility in, for example, how pension benefits are paid out. The lump sum payment will continue to be permitted. We are taking a major step forward in providing a Europe-wide single market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas and Commissioner Bolkestein are to be congratulated for this achievement. Tomorrow we must ensure a resounding vote of support for this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also back this compromise that has been reached if, under the leadership either of the rapporteur or of a delegation from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it were to be introduced into plenary immediately following negotiations with the Commission. In those circumstances, I would support it. A submitted compromise, or a wording presented by the Commission, has a history to it, however, and such compromises or wordings seem to me to be matters of dispute within the ECOFIN Council where, according to what I have been told, one or other of the Member States was, in the end, quite prepared to use another veto.</p>
<p class="contents">From the time of the Green Paper up until now when the second reading is imminent, the directive has had several names. The name of the directive really does not matter now, however. What matters, rather, is the content. Allow me therefore again to extract a couple of items from one of the Commission’s or, as the case may be, Commissioner Bolkestein’s proposals, for example from the proposal, as they put it, in expectation of reaching retirement age, which legitimises also those payments made before arrival at retirement age. What this has to do with pension payments, you will first need to explain to me again.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the biometric risks, there is clearly no European solution, particularly not in terms of guaranteeing the amounts paid in. That means that the entire capital market risk has been transferred to the policyholders, which is to say to the employees, and that is something I am unable to accept. There is no justification for saying, as has already been implied once here in Parliament, ‘Give me your money; trust me; I shall invest it and, if it disappears, that is your bad luck’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly perturbed by the fact that, in the compromise proposal, the Commission has removed the policyholders’ obligation, upon request, to provide information about their current pension rights. I do not think that what we have here is a good compromise, and I should have liked us to have had the opportunity of a conciliation procedure with a view to arriving in the end at a sensible European regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, and the Commissioner and his staff for what I believe is a very good compromise reached between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission, which will allow millions of Europeans to accumulate better pension rights wherever they work in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an essential plank of the Financial Services Action Plan. It will cut the administrative costs of many multinational companies’ pension funds, allowing people to have better pensions when they retire. It will help millions of European old people to retire in the sun.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, European citizens are effectively being denied their right to free movement during their working lives and during retirement because of the patchwork of national pension systems. These impose unacceptable barriers when people seek to change jobs or residence. This is a big step forward in dealing with them. We look forward to more progress, particularly on some of the tax issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies also suffer from a less mobile workforce and the additional bureaucracy, administration and costs involved in managing multiple pensions systems. Firms with a presence in all fifteen Member States face an estimated EUR 40 million a year in extra costs through having to deal with fifteen different pension providers and legal arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement also provides more choice of pension funds because it opens up the European market in investment management and pension administration. In future, we can have a genuine pension savings market of 377 million people, expanding after enlargement to 450 million people. This is a vast potential market.</p>
<p class="contents">Funded occupational retirement schemes in the EU cover 25% of the EU workforce and are currently valued at more than EUR 2 500 billion. They are expected to grow to more than EUR 7 000 billion by 2010. This is a key plank in the opening up of the financial services market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a market-opening measure without using sledgehammers to crack nuts. It gives a passport to pension funds to operate throughout the EU without trying to harmonise everything. Member States are responsible for determining the social requirements - such as death in service benefits - for their own pension funds and the tax reliefs that they give, consistent with subsidiarity. For example, I am pleased that lump sums are specifically allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the directive means that pension funds can now invest, taking into account their own beneficiaries' requirements rather than arbitrary rules set down by governments for the purchase of their own bonds and so forth. This insistence on the so-called ‘prudent person rule’ - the rule that investments are decided prudently - will open up the fund management market.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall this is an excellent measure. I commend it to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union does not have such a mandate however. Consequently, this report forms part of the work towards the objective of creating an internal market for financial services. This is absolutely clear. Above all, this report will allow supplementary retirement provision institutions in Britain and elsewhere to benefit from their position and offer cross-border services.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted against this report at the first reading at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The document certainly sought to correct the shortcomings concerning social obligations but it made investment risks worse. The common position of the Council better safeguards the prudential requirements for investment, but it does not meet Parliament’s demands on social issues. We have called for this common position to be rejected. We think that this report must be reconsidered in the context of the serious crisis affecting the stock markets at present. This is affecting pension funds. It poses a risk to the level of benefits and is causing contributions to be increased. Confidence in these pension fund systems will not be restored without strict management rules and mutual insurance structures for the guarantees. It is also necessary for these structures to be covered by European collective conventions between social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that Mr Karas has worked very hard on this report and has ensured that the text is balanced. At the end of the day, however, we believe the amendments have a limited scope. This is down to the agreements between the different components of the political groups and what the Council deems to be acceptable to avoid conciliation. The report is an improvement on the common position, and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance strengthens the prudential requirements for investment. Nevertheless, the fundamental and essential slant of the text remains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are not supporting this proposal because we wish to oppose the financing of supplementary pensions through accumulation of capital on principle. As Mr Kuckelkorn said, a pension is a pension. It is not a form of saving. Pensions are for life. They provide for workers when they retire. They also offer certain guarantees in case of incapacity. Reversion pensions provide for surviving spouses. Pensions are not financial products. It is quite possible that certain financial products and financial institutions may contribute to the management of certain pension schemes. Beyond this, however, we would be embarking on the search to establish European definitions of pension products and social mechanisms for the first time. We also need to consider in what circumstances financial institutions can make a contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, we are just dressing up savings products in a very ill-defined way. I would like to thank Mr Karas for all the efforts he has made to make this dressing-up as convincing as possible. Savings products have been dressed up to resemble pensions. With Mr Karas’ amendments, they were already far from being pensions. The compromise amendments, however, have made everything quite clear. They are purely and simply savings products and should be treated as such. It would amount to a violation of trading regulations to sell them as pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been no easy task to reach a compromise on such a complex issue as the supervision of occupational retirement provision. I can support the compromise reached in principle, although it is a weaker proposal than I would like to have seen.</p>
<p class="contents">I have submitted three amendments on behalf of the EDD Group, but also at the request of a number of fellow Members from other groups. I would like greater clarity from Commissioner Bolkestein on this. Is the European Commission prepared to promise that it will take account of the matters referred to in the amendments in the implementation phase of the directive? What promises can you make with regard to the subject of the annual reports and associated administrative burdens, as stated in the amendment to Articles 10 and 11?</p>
<p class="contents">A second question concerns the amendment to Article 18, Paragraph 2. Are you prepared to review the absolute prohibition of loans and to give Member States the option of prohibiting them if so desired? In Recital 8 there is after all clear reference to the principle of subsidiarity. This recital is not in my view consistent with the prohibition provision in Article 18.</p>
<p class="contents">If I receive a satisfactory answer to my questions, I will be prepared to reconsider my amendment. Finally, let me comment on the Dutch translation of the revised Amendment No 32, in which the words ‘or has a licence’ have been omitted in error. The English text contains the words ‘or authorised’ and I think that this is what must appear in the Dutch text too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been a privileged witness of the ferocity of the bulls he has had to fight: the Council – which is very divided – the Commission, the other groups in this House and in particular my own group, which has given him more headaches than all the other groups together.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to stress the generosity of the European Parliament. It is true that we have managed to have many of the amendments we presented at first reading accepted, but it is also the case that we have sacrificed legitimate, well-founded and well-argued aspirations in order to achieve a text which can be accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have sacrificed these positions, however, because we have always been aware that this directive was essential, at least for three reasons. Firstly, to make the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty more effective and more real, particularly the mobility of workers. Secondly, in order to supplement the public social security systems at a time – as has been said - when the challenge we must face in the coming years is a demographic one, the ageing of the population and the sustainability of public finances. These professional systems of a supplementary nature – I would insist on this aspect – will serve to maintain the future incomes of workers. This is a social approach which my group applauds. And, thirdly, because it will help to increase European saving, to increase the depth of the European financial market, which is the global objective of the financial services action plan. That saving will allow us to fund – and this ties in with what I said in the previous report – the investments we need in order to grow, in order to increase our employment and our productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas has highlighted many of the amendments which have enriched the original text of the Commission and the Council. I would like to stress the increase in transparency due to the information obligations required of the providers of these services, of the people who provide and guarantee these pensions, both with regard to the authorities and the participants. Secondly, and contrary to what somebody said from the benches of the left, because it incorporates social orientations which are very dear to those of us who advocate a social market economy. And thirdly because it increases the coordination of the supervision authorities and promotes the possibility of cross-border activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Commissioner, by stressing some of the deficiencies pointed out by the rapporteur. It will be necessary to make progress on tax harmonisation – I pointed this out in the previous report – if we want these cross-border activities to genuinely be expanded and freedom of choice to be real. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mr Karas for all his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the second reading will probably be acceptable overall. We are going to create a European passport for pension funds. We are dealing with a financial instrument but one that has social objectives. Some improvements are therefore necessary in relation to the Council’s positions. We need to guarantee European citizens decent pensions. Pension funds will have a role to play in this respect, especially if there is also biometric coverage for contributions, or protection against the hazards of life.</p>
<p class="contents">To present pension funds as a panacea however would be a deliberate lie. The press is today referring to a message from the <span class="italic">European Financial Services Round Table</span> to the Ecofin Council. It presents pension funds as a miracle solution to the problems of financing pensions in Europe in future. According to this association of large employers, it will no longer be possible to finance the first pillar of the pensions system, which involves redistribution, as there is an increasing number of recipients and a decreasing number of contributors. Pension funds that are based on the accumulation of capital, however, will experience exactly the same demographic problems once they reach maturity. In fact, pensions paid in any given year always involve transferring funds from working people to retired people, whether by redistribution or the accumulation of capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the bursting of the speculative bubble, most pension funds have shown negative yields. In the United States, pension funds provided by large companies are having to face up to a deficit of more than USD 300 billion. In Great Britain, the company pension funds deficit was estimated at between GBP 65 and 130 billion at the end of 2002. There are also significant deficits in Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and elsewhere. Even the modest pension funds for Members of the European Parliament have just amended contributions by three points. This type of exercise would also save all redistribution funds. Due to negative financial yields, companies with pension funds no longer have a guaranteed benefit system but a guaranteed contribution system. In a guaranteed benefit system, contributors save money which they will receive in their retirement. In a guaranteed contribution system, people know how much they are contributing, but receive no guarantee of the result of fund managers’ investment policy. It also goes without saying that fund managers always take their cut of the funds, however the fund is doing.</p>
<p class="contents">This explains why the financial sector welcomes the directive so warmly. Once again, the Group of the Party of European Socialists are not opposing the second and third pillar pension funds. We do, however, think that we need to act very prudently and that very strict prudential requirements are necessary. Mr President, pensions based on the accumulation of capital should not undermine national pension systems based on solidarity across the generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is of course clear, and so it is also right that we have two pension systems alongside one another, counterbalanced by the third-pillar system. Meeting our requirements as it does, though, this directive is extremely important. I am also very pleased with this compromise. In particular if you work cross-border – and more and more companies are no longer national companies, but have actually become European companies – there is an absolute need for this matter to be dealt with; you can actually describe this as a sort of constitution for occupational retirement provision in Europe. It is quite clear that not everything is regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have been addressing just one point, that we should do nothing social at all any more and that Member States should actually submit to the system that applies in the country that does least. Fortunately, that is not the case in this compromise, or, for that matter, in the proposals beforehand, which is why I think that the compromise on biometric risks is very fortunate. In my country it has up to now been customary to insure biometric risks. If someone from Great Britain suddenly appears on the market and does not insure any biometric risks and makes no mention of that and only talks of pots of gold, as appears to happen in the United Kingdom, then it could be that people quite mistakenly make inadequate retirement provision. It must be possible to prevent things of this kind and so that is why the compromise is exceptionally good.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the provision of information, there has been criticism of the fact that we have gained less than we originally sought. That is certainly true. It is perhaps a pity, but I believe that it is nonetheless a very significant advance that we are bringing about in this area certain common European standards rather than standards that are intrinsically American.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the tax issue. This we have of course left aside, as is, I think, far and away the best thing to do in political terms. I believe that with its announcement the Commission has acted correctly, that is by examining the extent to which the present taxes are not discriminatory. We have recently had the Danner ruling. That is one of those rulings that lead to Member States thinking twice before taking discriminatory tax measures against pension funds that happen not to be established in their own country. While we still have a long way to go, I think that all in all we have certainly made a start. If we were to reject this compromise, then we will not even have a start and then I believe we will not be doing any good as regards the social objectives that are there as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that the Council and the Commission were in any event prepared to take Parliament seriously as a co-legislator. As far as the content is concerned, I am no great enthusiast either, but with the compromise proposals we are in any event certainly giving a sharper outline to the definition of the funds that fall under this directive and that are now acquiring a European passport to invest and to offer their services across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In a European context, however, a far more profound discussion is needed about the content and the quality of second-pillar pension schemes. At the end of next week, at the European spring summit, a good start can be made on this not only by sharing information informally, but also by agreeing to reach a consensus on content and convergence of policy. If you want to propagate the second-pillar, fully-funded pensions, you also have to lead the discussion about the structure and the quality of these schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands roughly half of the income of pensioners is provided by fully-funded second-pillar schemes agreed by social partners – in the future even more of it will be. You cannot simply deal with them as if they were financial market products, which invest in the capital market and which have to find their way in the internal market as commercial services. No, the second pillar in the Netherlands expressly belongs with the first pillar, with the social security schemes and must not be lumped together with the individual third-pillar products for those who can afford them. That is a subject for social policy. That was also always on the agenda in the discussion and that should also therefore be developed further by way of the spring summit and those discussions about open coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I do however think that there is also more to do on the subject of internal market policy, because I do not agree with what a number of speakers have said, that is that this directive does not do so much to improve the mobility of employees and the opportunity to take pensions with you in the context of the free movement of employees. On this point far more must happen, not only fiscally, but also where the portability of pensions is concerned. Here too I would like to see a rather more ambitious approach from the Commission that finds its conclusion in legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Bolkestein and those officials reporting to him, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Othmar Karas, have done a magnificent job in particular. In addition, I would like to say to my friend, Othmar, that the Republic of Austria has reportedly overcome the difficult challenges of its history through a remarkable ability to establish consensus and find solutions to benefit all parties. I think with the work he has done with regard to this directive Othmar has shown he has the important qualities needed by someone who is influential in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring the existence of retirement provision will be one of the main political challenges of the EU Member States in the years to come. To address this challenge, however, we have a difficult message for the people of Europe. We must work for a longer period of time but at the same time the pension we receive from statutory occupational retirement schemes will be smaller than before. It will certainly sound like a <span class="italic">kamikaze</span> mission to any politician but it is nonetheless inevitable. The <span class="italic">status quo</span> is not an option.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Member States have the main responsibility for retirement provision we at Union level can implement measures to help promote retirement schemes by creating a sustainable basis for financing them. This directive on the activities of institutions for occupational retirement provision will create a legislative framework for Europe-wide action and will be one of the measures needed to defuse the pensions bomb. The directive will encourage the development of retirement schemes that are financially durable, provide companies with the capital they need through investment, and meet the needs of individuals that vary from one to another more effectively than statutory systems do. This will be especially true on the day we make headway with decisions on taxation. The directive will, on the one hand, promote the development of European financial markets and, on the other, benefit employees, who will profit from a more efficient and more transparent investment policy regarding their pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">It took 15 years to establish common EU laws. The EU citizen has long been able to benefit from local social and health services in another Member State. Furthermore, there has been common legislation in existence now for years applying to institutions providing personal pension insurance. The differing views among Member States on this subject, however – something we are discussing today – held up for too long this directive, which hopefully we will adopt in tomorrow’s plenary debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive now leaves the social partners in the Member States with a free hand to choose how to organise comprehensive voluntary retirement provision. This is a reasonable European compromise considering the differences that exist among pension systems in the Member States. Our negotiations were at times both very intensive and intense, but I believe that we will be satisfied with the end result. The most important thing was that we avoided possibly having to resort to the conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been an issue of compromise all the way through. I understand all the hard work that has been put into it, but let us say straight away that many people have been involved, inside and outside this Chamber, perhaps more than we know. However, the people who have not been involved - as is so often the case - are the people most likely to benefit or suffer from our decisions. Compromise was very necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a directive aimed at replacing the first pillar social security-type pension provision. In the UK, for example, people aged 16 have recently been outnumbered by people aged 60. Throughout the European Union this must leave no doubt in anybody's mind that we have an ageing society, one that will gradually cost more and must be adequately provided for so as to avoid future pensioner poverty, a very real risk. The problem is that many people, even today, do not feel obliged or encouraged to save for their retirement. Many companies are hamstrung by administrative and legal costs prohibiting the promotion of such funds across the European Union. That is a statement of fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though this directive delivers a balanced view, taking into account the various factors affecting Member States, it is clear that the cross-border approach to supplementary pensions needs more in the way of liberalising articles. I hope that we will come back to this discussion at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Some companies in my country which believe that they can pull out of defined benefit schemes have even looked to this particular directive as an excuse, but Brussels gives no such excuse to those companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lump sum payments have been dealt with in a way that pensioners in many countries will feel is a reflection of what already occurs. That is an important minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the changes we have introduced on transparency and registration are improvements that everyone in this House can live with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Spanish colleague Mr García-Margallo y Marfil talked in terms of Mr Karas’s winning a bullfight, and that makes me angry with him, as I do not like bullfights. Moreover, he was the first and only MEP to talk about the greying of the population. If he had told me that I am an old lady – perhaps on the model of the one whose visit proves so dangerous in Dürrenmatt’s famous play – I would not have minded one bit. What I am not at all keen on is being called grey.</p>
<p class="contents">What do old people want? Security, independence and autonomy. It is just that all this is very difficult to achieve in the framework of occupational retirement provision that is only offered on a time-limited basis. Even a one-off payment – however generous it might be – does not provide security. Lifelong payments do most justice to the wishes and also to the needs of old people, corresponding to what we understand to mean by social security. It is to Mr Karas’s credit that he has clarified this very important idea and embedded it in the report, and I should like to thank him for his efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout Europe, we are in the process of discussing and solving the problems of a society in which people at long last ought to be living longer. With a whole package of measures for older employees, the freshly elected Austrian Federal Government has devised a range of options for giving older people the opportunity of being able to work longer. I say ‘of being able to’, please note. A reduction in incidental labour costs for those aged over 58, a push for higher qualifications and the promotion of part-time work for older people are just a few of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lulling will certainly agree with me when I say that this society and this Parliament need us. Anyone who, like myself, has six grandchildren can no longer just relinquish this society of ours to other people. We ourselves have to take care of it. We oldies are not of course in the end fighting for ourselves, since we obviously already have an income. Rather, we are fighting for the young men and women whom we wish to see have much longer lives. A child born today may live until the age of a hundred, and we wish him or her an extremely long and, as far as possible, secure life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of his best efforts, the rapporteur has not succeeded in improving the common position, which really does not add anything in terms of quality. Devising a framework within which products are offered that, from today’s point of view, may seriously impair living standards in old age has nothing to do with a sense of political responsibility. What is really needed here are regulations to reduce people’s uncertainties at precisely the present time. In recent years, British pension funds alone have lost 35 million pounds, and rather more still in the years before that, so they too have not exactly excelled. Nor have matters gone significantly better for the other Member States. At a period such as this, people ought not, where the issue of pensions is concerned, to be led to expect quality when it is not present.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality regulation of the European market is certainly not brought about by a minimal duty to provide information, together with what is no more than discretionary wording enabling the Member States to define quality for a restricted market with reference to biometric risks. If – as you yourself always do, Commissioner – we want to see such quality or an increase in quality, then we can, at this stage, really make no better start than by agreeing to the proposal by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to reject the common position. That alone would signify ‘back to square one’ and, for us, new opportunities of obtaining an improved directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has given an assurance that it is able to agree to the package before us. That is crucial, because only in that way can a lengthy conciliation procedure be avoided which, for everyone concerned – employees, employers and financial service providers – might have the kind of damaging effect that this long overdue European regulation might have again postponed.</p>
<p class="contents">I could have lived with the common position because the directive concerned is of course designed primarily to regulate, without barriers to competition, the cross-border activities of pension fund providers, and not the product itself. It was essential to devise a directive that, on the one hand, did not, from the outset, force these financial service providers into a suffocating straightjacket of regulations, for example governing investment policy; and that, on the other hand, organised supervision in such a way that the benefits paid to policyholders were secured in the best way possible. I believe we have to some degree succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our task here to prescribe what kind of supplementary pensions are to be provided and for what sums. Naturally, the directive can be made to reflect a pious desire for the arrangements concerning occupational retirement provision also to cover the famous biometric risks such as disablement, widow’s and orphan’s pensions etc. It should, however, be left to companies and their employees to determine what they wish to cover that is not already covered by the public social security system – in other words, the first pillar – in the full knowledge that higher and diversified benefit entitlements naturally have their price.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, it should also be possible – as, by the way, it is in the case of MEPs’ pension fund – for capital to be paid out as a lump sum at retirement age, without its being prescribed what, specifically, the capital is to be used for. If, when I am old, I want to use the money concerned to fulfil a life-long dream, such as going on a long journey around the world, I should be able to use the money for that purpose. I must of course be certain that I do not then have to become a burden on the state.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that we were unable to bring to fruition a concern, to which I and other MEPs had committed ourselves, that financial institutions in addition to pension funds and insurance companies should be able to offer their services in the field of occupational pensions insurance. That would have led to a level playing field and so to greater competition. The package does, however, oblige the EU Commission to examine how matters stand in the market for occupational retirement provision in order to make it possible for other financial services providers too to come within the scope of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, this directive has done nothing to bring about a common market in supplementary pensions. We definitely need a regulation to prevent the double taxation of premiums and benefits, and I hope that we shall have the considerable judgment required in order to devise a sensible regulation quickly.</p>

<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament agree on the compromise text, which may not satisfy everyone. At least it is an agreed text. That is what we need on this most important subject. Parliament is entitled to hear what the Commission thinks about the various amendments, but before doing that I should like to say something to three Members who have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the issue of taxation referred to by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Pronk and Mrs Lulling. The follow-up to the pension taxation communication of April 2001 has developed along two tracks.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a discussion process in the Council concerning the Commission's suggestions to improve the exchange of information on cross-border pensions and to deal with double taxation and double non-taxation. The process did not, I am sorry to say, lead to tangible results. A number of Member States could only accept any sort of agreement if the issue of residence taxation of pension payouts versus source taxation was also tackled. On that issue Member States remained deeply split.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has been examining whether or not the national taxation rules on the deductibility of pension contributions are compatible with EU law. Here the Commission kept its promises to take action. Last month the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Denmark and five letters of formal notice to Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. In all those Member States pension contributions paid to foreign funds are not tax-deductible, while contributions paid to domestic funds are. That is a clear case of discrimination. The Commission is convinced that Community law prohibits such a difference in treatment. I can assure Parliament that these infringement cases are a priority for the Commission, which will do whatever is necessary to open up the markets effectively for cross-border pension provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Blokland I say that, according to my information, the amendments which he has put forward have not been accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and therefore do not - it seems to me - form part of the discussion tonight. Therefore the Commission has no opinion on them.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Purvis I say that this directive is based on two principles: first, the principle of compliance with prudential requirements of the home Member States and second, compliance with the social and labour legislation of the host Member States, i.e. where the company is established. That includes provisions on biometric risks, but that should not be an obstacle to cross-border activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the compromise arrived at means that there will be no conciliation. That is a good thing. One never knows where conciliation might lead. Personally, I have very vivid memories of conciliation from the takeover directive and am very anxious not to repeat that experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the amendments submitted to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I am please to say that the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 5, 13, 15, 22 and the package of amendments 25 to 37. The commission cannot accept the other amendments, which for the most part aim at widening the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not intend to interfere in the way Member States organise their pension systems. It considers that the directive should not regulate in a restrictive way the products offered by pension funds. Nor should it define the precise arrangements for the payment of benefits. The directive must also respect the diversity of occupational pension systems while setting some strict standards to ensure their mutual recognition, but without imposing unnecessary costs for pension funds. That is why the Commission rejects Amendments 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive should not experiment by allowing for the possibility of extending the scope of this directive to institutions that today do not offer occupational pension products. Institutions that already benefit from a single market framework should not be covered by this directive, with the exception of life insurance companies, for which Member States must retain the option to apply this directive for activities linked to pension provisions. That is why the Commission cannot accept, regrettably, Amendments 2, 6, 8, 10 and 17.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive must make full reference to an effective system to ensure efficient exchange of information between competent authorities and promote consistent enforcement of the directive, but that must be done without prejudice to possible future structures. That is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 7, 19, 20, 21 and 23.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 24 tabled by the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance since it considers that pension funds, as very long-term investors with low liquidity risks, should not be overly restricted in their investment in non-liquid assets such as shares.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept the motion for rejection of the common position, since it considers the common position to be a finely balanced compromise and recommends its adoption to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Creating a single market for occupational pensions was one of the priorities of the ‘Lisbon strategy’, under the Financial Services Action Plan, which seeks to achieve the integration or liberalisation of capital markets in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives of private capitalisation are clearly demonstrated in the lack of genuine prudential rules, in the liberalisation of investments and service provision at European level and in the absence of guarantees covering all risks, or allowing them only on an optional basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur himself, in his explanatory statement, sets the tone, by stating that this proposal will contribute to the development of the financial markets, acknowledging that the common position lacks balance between taking into account the social security of the beneficiaries and the aim of creating a simple framework for capital markets. Hence the adoption of amendments from first reading, which fall considerably short of what we would wish to see and which do not call into question the approach of the original proposal. This is the raison d’être of my political group’s proposal, which I supported, for an amendment seeking the rejection of the Council’s common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
