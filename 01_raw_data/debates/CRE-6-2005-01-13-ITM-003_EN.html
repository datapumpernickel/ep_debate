<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is an honour and pleasure for me to present the Commission's view on the presidential elections in Ukraine. More than seven weeks have now passed since what is commonly described as Ukraine's Orange Revolution. The events during that period have shown that the people of Ukraine are committed to democracy and also that the EU Member States, by acting together, can play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to three questions. First, how far has Ukraine come since the first running of the second round of the elections on 21 November 2004, and what does this mean for the country in the future? Second, what role has the EU played to assist Ukraine to find a peaceful solution to the crisis? Third, what are the challenges now in European Union-Ukraine relations?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with the developments in Ukraine and what they mean for the future. Most importantly, Ukraine has succeeded in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it faced after the serious shortcomings in the conduct of the presidential elections and, notably, the first run of the second round on 21 November. The situation posed a threat to the country's legal framework and its territorial integrity, but both of these were preserved. The International Election Observation Mission, led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, found that the re-run of the second round of the presidential elections on 26 December brought Ukraine closer to international standards. That is a positive sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The political compromise reached on 8 December 2004 was important in that it paved the way for a new second round of the presidential elections. It is our firm hope that the compromise will also help promote further democratisation in Ukraine. Important constitutional changes were agreed, establishing the framework for the country's internal development in the years ahead, and the role of Ukraine's parliament has been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have demonstrated the Ukrainian people's strong attachment to democracy. We very much welcome this development. Further efforts will be needed to build on this and to take the democratisation process forward in the years ahead. We very much hope that the conduct of the parliamentary elections next year will reflect further progress towards democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the second question: how has the EU helped Ukraine to find a peaceful solution? The EU has given sustained political support to help the people of Ukraine find a peaceful outcome to the crisis. It spoke with one voice, urging the Ukrainian authorities to show restraint and all parties to express themselves exclusively by non-violent means.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also helped to prepare the ground for the political compromise of 8 December 2004, with European mediators, including High Representative Mr Solana, Polish President, Mr Kwasniewski, and the Lithuanian President, Mr Adamkus, playing a very useful facilitating role.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also made a major contribution, together with the broader international community, to help ensure that the re-run of the second round of the elections would be fair and free. In concrete terms, the EU sent 587 short-term election observers from the EU Member States for the elections on 26 December. The participation in the election observation of a team of nine Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Siwiec, was an important contribution. The European Commission financed the participation of a further 150 short-term observers from the non-EU OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Member States, as well as voter education activities. Overall, the EU played a highly significant role in helping secure correct conduct of the elections on 26 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what are the challenges ahead in European Union-Ukraine relations? Clearly, now is the time to take a fresh look at our relationship with Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner of the European Union. Through the developments of the past weeks the people of Ukraine have already clearly demonstrated their commitment to the development of Ukraine into a society that fully respects democracy and fundamental freedoms. However, this is only the beginning of a long process which will require our continued support.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Ukraine entering the European Union is not on the agenda. The European Neighbourhood Policy is distinct from membership. It will allow us to shift to a higher gear in cooperation with Ukraine. Within the framework of the European Union-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it opens new partnership and economic integration and cooperation perspectives and offers significant upgrading in our relationships. The key tool for putting this into practice is the action plan. Last December, the Council endorsed the EU-Ukraine ENP Action Plan and agreed to forward it to the European Union-Ukraine Cooperation Council 'as soon as developments in Ukraine allowed'. We all believe that the time has come to move ahead with this action plan. It identifies key priorities such as further strengthening the stability and effectiveness of the institutions, guaranteeing democracy and the rule of law, ensuring the democratic conduct of elections in Ukraine in accordance with OSCE standards, and ensuring respect for the freedom of the media and freedom of expression. It also provides a comprehensive programme for our work with Ukraine in all areas of cooperation, with actions identified in the fields of political dialogue, justice and home affairs, economic and trade relations, people-to-people contacts, cross-border activities and shared responsibility in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. We hope that the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council meeting on 21 February will endorse this action plan, thereby paving the way for Ukraine and us to begin work on its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council's request, the High Representative and the Commissioner are working on concrete proposals to strengthen cooperation with Ukraine making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing Ukraine's relationship with the European Union. From the Commission's point of view, this proposal should, as far as possible, also take into account Ukraine's requests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan is a sufficiently comprehensive and flexible tool to allow us to respond to the new situation. The offer the EU makes in the action plan can be modulated to reflect the progress made by the partner. The further a partner is ready to go in taking practical steps to implement common values, the further the EU will be ready to go in strengthening our mutual links. The pace of progress in the ENP will thus depend on the pace of progress made by the new Ukrainian administration. There is therefore no need to renegotiate the action plan with that administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly acknowledged Ukraine's European aspirations and welcomed Ukraine's European choice. Recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed the country's place on the European map. We have no doubt that these events will enter into history as a milestone, not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country. The European Union and Ukraine have a common interest in further reinforcing their political, economic and cultural ties. If Ukraine fully respects its commitments, as expressed in the action plan, the Commission is willing to help ensure that the European Neighbourhood Policy results in significantly enhanced relations between the European Union and Ukraine. We trust that the European Parliament will support us in all these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important sign, which reflects our interest in the changes and our positive attitude towards them. It also reflects the special role played by the European Parliament, which was one of the first to react to the victory of democracy in Ukraine. The time for words is past, and it is now time for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The empty chair of the Luxembourg Presidency, which has chosen to be absent during this debate, is telling. During a debate held in this House yesterday, I highlighted the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of Ukraine in the Luxembourg Presidency’s list of priorities. I am also deeply disappointed at the extremely conservative, modest and static position adopted by the European Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the changes that have taken place, it would be wholly inadequate to offer Ukraine the old Action Plan. Democracy and values that are also shared by us have triumphed in Ukraine, and this calls for a change in the European Union’s approach to the country. We must offer Ukraine a new strategy and a new quality of relations, which means that we need new instruments, not instruments negotiated with President Yanukovych’s government in a previous era.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous expressions of sympathy and support should be transformed into decisive and rapid action, and it should not be forgotten that time is a key factor. We cannot afford to wait, and we must move beyond mere rhetoric. We therefore expect both the Council and the Commission to undertake immediate measures. The old Action Plan drawn up in a previous era is no longer appropriate to the new conditions in the country, and therefore needs to be revised and extended beyond the scope of the neighbourhood policy. We should support Ukraine in its attempt to achieve market economy status, and ensure that a free-trade zone is created between the European Union and Ukraine. The latter should be helped to gain membership of the World Trade Organisation and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and to approximate its legislation to that of the European Union. Political dialogue should be initiated on structural issues and, as part of this dialogue, talks opened with Ukraine on energy security and the fight against terrorism. A simplified visa regime should be considered for the country, and an Association Agreement with Ukraine should replace the Action Plan. Work on such an Association Agreement should begin now, so that it will be possible to replace the Action Plan after three years. Finally, we should offer Ukraine the prospect of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures should act as a strong incentive for continuing and far-reaching political and economic reforms in Ukraine. This is in our clear interest, and in the interest of the victory of democracy across Eastern Europe. I thank you.</p>

What has come out of the crisis in Ukraine is a major victory for democracy and freedom in a country which has, over the past decade, always been on the brink of becoming an autocratic state. Moreover, it is a pleasant surprise for the European Union and not least for this House, both of which have played a major role in the positive outcome of the events in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At long last, democracy has done what it is meant to do in Ukraine. Since the Ukrainians were able to speak out freely about the direction their country was going in, the outcome reflects the will of the people. What has happened in Ukraine over the past few months is a fundamental departure, a sort of democratic uprising which has not culminated in violence, as is often the case elsewhere, and for that we should be grateful to all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the beginning of a new chapter in the development of Ukraine. The new president’s government should, as its first task, entrench democracy and the rule of law, as well as develop the economy. I believe we are all agreed that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, implement the action plan which the European Commission has tabled in the framework of the neighbourhood policy in order to strengthen our ties with Ukraine as much as we can in this context. It follows that the maximum use must be made of the scope offered by this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It was, though, not only Ukraine to which these events posed a major challenge. The European Union will need to reconsider its approach to Ukraine. It is no longer sufficient for the EU simply to intensify the limited dialogue which has always been maintained, despite the outgoing President Kuchma’s policies, with the former regime. Europe is now facing the task of changing political relations with Ukraine, for the country has elected a president who has never concealed his European orientation and aspirations. Those who marched in favour of democracy, marched in favour of Brussels rather than Moscow, and I think that we should give due consideration to this in our policy. I share the view expressed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we should really ask ourselves whether the Commission’s policy, as described by Commissioner Potočnik, is ambitious enough. In any event, the resolution which Parliament is discussing today goes quite a bit further than what the Commission and Council have been prepared to do so far.</p>
<p class="contents">What also matters at the moment is that we give active support to those in Ukraine who really want to carry out reforms. They will need to take a number of difficult decisions, and support from the European Union, clear signals from the European Union, can certainly help them to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken much of the responsibility for a good outcome of the elections. We are now also responsible for the further consolidation of democracy in that country. I should like to add that what has happened in Ukraine comes at a time when we need to revisit the EU’s policy with regard to all countries in that region, and gives us cause to do so. It is also important to formulate responses, and to anticipate questions that Ukraine, and also the other countries in that region, will certainly be raising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a great day for Ukraine, because following weeks of peaceful protests, and despite especially foul weather conditions, it was decided to hold a third round of presidential elections. Eventually, all those involved agreed to this with great maturity. It was an important moment for the European Union, because its unanimous action made it possible to achieve a positive outcome, and also because the European Union made most of the efforts in the field of electoral observation, to which my group has, of course, also contributed. Finally, the correct manner in which the elections were conducted made it an especially great day for democracy. I should like to underline that 300 000 Ukrainians were also involved in this electoral observation, which is quite a gigantic effort. The run-up to the elections as a whole made Ukraine a stronger society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise that there will also be a great need for free and independent media, and that the new president and the government that is to be formed will need to set to building and strengthening the market economy and the constitutional state. I am not sure if I understood you correctly, Commissioner, when you said that the action plan offers plenty of scope for intensifying relations between the European Union and Ukraine. I should like to have this confirmed by you, because, should that not be the case, let it be clear that we too would call for the action plan to be renegotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by reminding you of Article 49 of the Treaty of the European Union, which stipulates that a European country, provided it meets the conditions, can apply for membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, now, are we to do with our Ukrainian friends who have turned towards Europe? The fact is that, in the streets and in the icy cold, the Ukrainian people have, in the course of a month, chosen the camp in which they are to build their future: the camp of democracy, non-violence and Europe. I believe that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is a victory for our European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself was one of the 1 200 OSCE observers who oversaw the poll on 26 December, not in Kiev but in Belgrade, in the Odessa region situated close to the border with Romania and Moldova, where certain villages are neither Russian nor Ukrainian-speaking. Thanks to the new law that has been put in place, the way in which it had been possible to prepare for the second round of the presidential elections was remarkable. We noted how smoothly matters went at the polling stations when the votes were being counted, and we were able to keep track of the ballot papers until they were finally recorded by the Regional Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine’s unshakeable desire to join the ranks of democracy will cause a shake-up in our policies, Commissioner. One has only to read the plan of the new team I was able to meet at the conclusion of our mission. I can inform you of their proposals. Of the two objectives that emerge very clearly, the first is integration into the European Union, an issue already being examined by working parties. The second is decentralisation, which should prevent the country from splitting. Nor must the massive trauma of Chernobyl be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore surprised, Commissioner, at your speech removing this prospect from Ukraine. With their orange revolution, the Ukrainian people have raised, and are raising now, the issue of our capacity to respond to the aspirations created by ourselves. Just recently, and with more than 70% of the vote, we again gave a huge endorsement to Article 1 of the Constitution, stating that ‘[t]he Union shall be open to all European States which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need now to reflect upon the relevance of the New Neighbourhood Policy for countries such as Ukraine if they have no prospects of accession. I think it would be a mistake to send them this message. For us, Ukraine definitely has its place as an EU Member State.</p>

I agree with Commissioner Potočnik that, essentially, everything proceeded without bloodshed, and that the elections were run according to European standards in organisational and technical terms, although in no way without certain points worthy of comment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my visit to Ukraine for the re-run presidential elections confirmed my opinion that the reality of life is dramatically different from the media portrayal. I regret to have to say that even Euronews reports have been surprisingly biased towards the orange faction. I do not understand why we have to manufacture antagonists artificially, and why we are exporting mass misunderstandings from Europe to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that our present task is not to preach to Ukraine, or Russia, or the media, but to work towards the ideals of understanding in Europe. I should therefore like to recommend that we give our support to the working groups, which are starting their analysis of the terms and conditions for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union. This is not just a matter of assisting Ukraine and the Union with mutual links; we must make a contribution to stabilising the political situation in Ukraine by helping to keep one of the new president’s pre-election promises. We can also help to achieve a goal which was never at odds with the wishes of the blue faction, but was just misrepresented by politicians and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I recommend that we open discussions on a code of democratic elections. It is essential not only to establish unified principles, which must be observed so that elections can be recognised as democratic, but it must also be stated to what extent we are willing to tolerate divergences between real life and our ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">My third recommendation is to establish tolerance criteria for foreign interference in the process of democracy. It is undeniably true that every state has a legitimate right to defend its own interests, so that every country has a government which is well disposed towards it. But can we, in such a situation, talk of the legitimacy of the elected government?</p>
<p class="contents">We must find answers to these questions. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether we can be proud of our involvement will become apparent from future events, yet what does the future hold?</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, Ukrainians are aware that the European Union lent its support to Mr Yushchenko. The handshakes with Mr Yushchenko before cameras on Independence Square and the orange orgy in this House, to which the media devoted much space, made it quite plain to Ukrainians that we were not neutral. If it were merely democracy that had been at stake, MEPs would not have got dressed up in orange. Once Mr Yushchenko takes office as the new president, any criticism of him will also be directed at the European Union as the force that helped him to victory.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions will also soon start to be asked, and in fact have already been asked, pertaining to the sources of funding for the Orange Revolution. Thirty-three thousand of Mr Yushchenko’s representatives in district electoral committees were provided with satellite phones, yet who paid for them? Tents and food were supplied to the demonstrators in Kiev, yet who paid for them? We have been told that President Yanukovych brought his supporters in from Donbas on buses, almost certainly paid for with state funds, but who paid for Mr Yushchenko’s supporters to get to Kiev, and on what form of transport? Ukraine is a poor country, and all this must have been funded by someone. Russia, the USA and the European Union are all accusing each other of interfering in the affairs of others. As it becomes increasingly apparent that Mr Yushchenko is unable to fulfil all the expectations held of him, more and more criticism will be directed at the European Parliament, as it was the most visible external force that became involved on Mr Yushchenko’s behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions will also be asked regarding the external bodies that profited most from Mr Yushchenko’s election. Ukraine is currently a poor country, but it has the potential to become a rich one. Who will try to get their hands on this wealth? Who will exploit it, and how much will the Ukrainian people profit from this? It is time for us to realise that there is still a long way to go until the political situation in Ukraine is stabilised, and the use of force is still a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the methods of dialogue and mediation will become established as standard features of political life. Yet are we in a position to guarantee this? If the situation were to culminate in the use of force, what would we do then? I hope the people of Ukraine will find answers to their problems in a peaceful fashion, and I hope the changes that have taken place there will yield positive results. If they do not, the European Parliament will share in the blame. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our donning of the colour orange and the visits made by many of us to Ukraine were not expressions of support for one of the candidates, and this is something that should be stated very clearly. Irrespective of political differences within this House, as I see it, we did not stand up for one specific political candidate or participate in political debates within Ukraine. What we did do, however, was to support democracy and the process of democracy. If we had been sure that President Yanukovych had been victorious in a fair and democratic election, we would have respected the choice made by Ukraine. By becoming involved and helping the Ukrainian people, we supported democracy and freedom ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">and demonstrated our respect for Ukrainians, who showed enormous courage and determination in defending the values which are shared by people from Ukraine to Portugal and throughout our entire continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it very clear that the courage shown by Ukrainians during the weeks of the Orange Revolution should now be shown by the European institutions. Unfortunately, after the Commissioner’s speech today I can only conclude that, to put it mildly, we still lack this courage. The people of Ukraine made it very obvious that their choice related to matters of geopolitics and civilisation, and that they wish to be part of our Community, whilst being aware that this is not a political act that can take place rapidly and painlessly. Realistically, this House must admit that it is a process that will necessarily last some time. Yet Ukrainians, and many of the European Union’s citizens, now expect the EU institutions to offer Ukraine the prospect of membership in the European Union. I thank you.</p>

I too have been able to assist with monitoring the elections in Ukraine and I can now report, as an observer, that the elections were free and democratic. I should like to point out that I know what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Council of Europe, I have for ten years had the opportunity to monitor various elections and this has been a critical period for some countries, I might mention the elections in Croatia, Albania or even the last parliamentary elections in Ukraine. In comparison with all these elections, it can be said that the elections were well prepared, the atmosphere was calm, they were transparent and monitored by observers for both candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority achieved in the results of the election show that the president was indeed elected. This does not mean a victory for the west or a defeat for the east. It can be said that the Ukrainians were victorious. Ukraine now has the feeling for the first time that it has achieved independence, that it has come of age as a state.</p>
<p class="contents">The saying goes: ‘Glory to the victor, honour to the vanquished!’ It is important now for the Ukrainian president to unite the nation in an effort to revive the historical importance which Ukraine has always enjoyed in Europe, to make it an important bridge between the European Union and Russia. And of course, I also support the proposal made here for Ukraine to become a future member of the European Union, but only if its citizens so wish, of course. I support the proposal made by the president of our delegation, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, that a committee should be formed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There, a people has stirred itself into action and, using peaceful means, forced the holding of free elections. Those who have seen the young people in Kiev’s tent camps cannot deny that this was accomplished – and was exemplary in showing what can be accomplished – with the persuasive power that peaceful democrats possess, and that this was comparable to the situation in which many of our peoples found themselves in 1989, 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be in no doubt that we in this House helped to bring this about, as did the other institutions, which we had to win over in order that they might join in. Moreover, it has to be clear to us that this happened in order to set in motion a democratic process and, at the same time, to enable Ukraine to decide where it belongs. The fact is that, ever since the Helsinki Final Act, the vitally important thing about Europe is that every country possesses the right of self-determination – but its people have to fight for it. Where it goes once it has it is for the people themselves to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">We should no longer be thinking in terms of spheres of influence. In this Europe of ours, of course, balances have to be struck and bridges built in order to prevent new tensions from arising, including with our great neighbours in the East. If this is to work, we have to support the democratically elected President in such a way that it becomes apparent to his own people that deciding for democracy is worth it, and that there are rewards to be found in looking westwards. For that, the action plan is inadequate, and we have to do a lot more thinking. It must surely involve Ukraine having the prospect of joining the EU, and whether or not to do so it will have to decide for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">That means, though, that the European Union must create the conditions under which that can happen – and this is where I urge this House to help. Today, a remarkably large number of those who supported the idea of Ukraine joining the European Union were the same people who, yesterday, did not vote in favour of the Constitution. We must put ourselves in a position to welcome other countries as members; today, we are not, and we have to wait until things are really up and running in the ten new Member States. That is why we need to add to full membership the development of other options, such as Article 47 and a sensible neighbourhood policy including the possibility of participation in the European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is done in the right way, Moldova too will soon be moving towards democracy, as well as – I hope in the next few years – Belarus. We will end up with what happened in the Balkans happening on a wider scale, and to these countries we must offer something; not just membership in 20 years’ time, but something that is meaningful today.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue with less reticence and more imagination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, Mr Potočnik, trains are powered by modern electric motors. If we cannot offer Ukraine a modern electric locomotive, we should at least offer it a decent diesel one. We need a new Action Plan, with a new timetable where the terminus station is membership. There may well be other stations along the way, but membership should be the terminus. The Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which I have the honour of chairing and which is appointed by the European Parliament, will work to achieve such a timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been presented with an opportunity to fan the flames of the people’s revolution in yet another European country. It is a revolution that did not begin in 1989, but in 1980 in Poland. In order to support this process, the Ukrainian people and their new government need to make clear declarations and demonstrate their determination and willingness to undergo sacrifices. We will listen carefully to what Mr Yushchenko says as president, not on Independence Square, but when he is sworn in. Renewed institutional support is needed for market and democratic reforms, and this is a task for Europe and the international financial institutions. We must hold realistic talks and cooperate with the United States, and we must also hold realistic talks with Russia in order to ensure that it views the developing situation in Ukraine as an opportunity and not merely a threat. Courage and caution are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The revolution in Ukraine has come to an end. We should not forget that the divisions it brought to light cannot be described in simple terms, with the ‘goodies’ on one side of the barricades and the ‘baddies’ on the other. In the end, both sides took part in round-table talks and resolved the problem peacefully, with the Supreme Court, the President and other institutions being involved in this process. New elections were held, and a new President was elected, whom we recognise as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Work is now getting underway to put the revolutionary slogans into practice, and the consent of both the opposing camps is needed. A better Ukraine cannot be built without the 44% of voters who supported Mr Yanukovych. Finally, a large country is always a source of uncertainty and a threat to cowards, but a source of interest and opportunity to adventurers. We should take our place amongst the adventurers. I thank you.</p>

Yet Ukraine is a powerful country in Eastern Europe, and recent events in this country can easily be compared to another fall of the Berlin Wall, albeit the Berlin Wall in the East.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until the Orange Revolution, democratic principles were unheard of to the east of the European Union, with the exception of the tiny country of Georgia. They remain unheard of today in Russia and Belarus, as well as in the other former Soviet republics. Apart from the tiny country of Georgia, which dared to make a stand for democracy a year ago, the only other place where such principles are currently adhered to is a powerful country of 50 million inhabitants. This country covers an area greater than that of France, and its people vigorously and resolutely called for democratic principles to be applied in practice and not just on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major revolution, and our actions should be equal to these events. Up until now, the European Union’s actions have indeed been equal to events in Ukraine. I will be honest and admit that I was amazed to see the European Union react so rapidly, and to see that it was mediators from the European Union, and not from the United States, who played a leading role in the resolution of conflict in Ukraine. I was proud of that, but I certainly did not feel proud as I listened to Mr Potočnik’s statements today. It would appear that the Commissioner, the European Commission and the European Council are regretting their involvement after 21 November, and now wish to withdraw. We cannot give our consent to this. We became involved, we acted as mediators, and we ensured matters were resolved peacefully. Our duty is to continue providing assistance to the Orange Revolution and to democracy in Ukraine, and to open the European Union’s doors to a country that lies entirely within Europe’s geographical boundaries.</p>

Were it not for the presidential elections in Ukraine being overshadowed by the disastrous floods in Asia, that would have been for me the second-best Christmas in political terms since Prague in 1989.</p>
<p class="contents">I was with Parliament’s delegation in the electoral districts to the south of Kiev and can confirm that the election not only ran peacefully, but also in a very correct manner. We congratulate the democracy movement, and Mr Viktor Yushchenko on winning the election.</p>
<p class="contents">His victory is an outstanding one, gained under difficult economic circumstances and in a region still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and, most of all, of the Soviet regime. We support the democracy movement and the renewal of an ancient European country, Ukraine, as it moves towards the rule of law, human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This tremendous movement will extend its influence into Russia and Belarus, but I wish to refute Commissioner Potočnik’s claim that accession to the EU is not on the agenda. I believe that Ukraine is part of Europe, and, if that is the case, Ukraine also belongs in the EU, provided that it fulfils the conditions. We should do everything necessary to ensure that it does.</p>

That is something that I, as a convinced Calvinist, should like to mention.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday evening, 10 January, Ukraine’s central election committee officially declared Viktor Yushchenko to be winner of the presidential elections and with this, a stunning fact became reality for the West and East alike. In a large former Soviet republic, the opposition managed, by democratic and peaceful means, to beat the post-Communist <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span>. It stands to reason that the democratic forces in neighbouring Belarus, in particular, draw courage from this. It looks as if they will need a great deal of patience, though, to repeat the political masterstroke achieved by Mr Yushchenko and his supporters. At the same time, I expect the Council and Commission to give their support to the reformist citizens of Belarus to the best of their abilities. Incidentally, the Yushchenko camp cannot manage without the same level of European backing either.</p>
<p class="contents">In very practical terms, Mr Klich has illustrated this backing in two useful amendments. Europe helped promote Ukraine’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and its speedy recognition as a market economy, Europe’s support is just as much needed in combating the widespread evil of corruption and strengthening the legal system. Meanwhile, the new Ukrainian President and Government are faced with two sensitive tasks. Domestically, they will need to deal with the supporters of the bad loser, Mr Yanukovych, with much tact and reconciliatory skill. Externally, the most important thing is to be self-assured in striking up the necessary good relationship with Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">So we see Ukraine, 15 years after 1991, being given a second chance in the form of a new start. Under President Yanukovych, this would certainly not have been possible. Striking in this respect is the historical parallel which Ukraine specialist, Professor Gerhard Simon, recently drew in a presentation at the University of Eichstätt. Ukraine’s so-called Orange Revolution is as politically significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the end of the Soviet Union.</p>

Ukraine will never be the same again. There have been public demands for the right to mobilise the people not only in action against fraud in the presidential elections, but also demands for democracy and the rule of law. Wide-spread public participation has helped Ukraine to achieve tasks for which revolutions have in the past been necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">Significant changes in the move towards democratisation have already had an impact on the Supreme Court, security services and media. Several risks, however, remain, which may hinder the Ukrainian people from implementing their choice. The dangers of a divided country may well be exaggerated, but they do exist. There is no reason to doubt that the mass media, which is loyal to the Russian president and retains significant influence in the eastern part of Ukraine, will continue to call into question the choice made by the majority of the Ukrainian people. Other risks include Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy. The Russian market is also Ukraine's most important destination for exports. Quite recently, at the end of the 1990s, the Baltic States, in particular Latvia, still felt the impact of Russia's wish to make use of similar dependency. </p>
<p class="contents">The weakness of previous reforms, particularly in the court system, may threaten the quality of future reforms in Ukraine. The European Union must help Ukraine to overcome these risks, we cannot lose this opportunity for historic change: economic assistance, investments, but above all trading opportunities. The European Union must provide Ukraine with the opportunity of entering its internal market, in particular Ukraine's few competitive steel and food enterprises. Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation must be encouraged. The rapid preparation of a plan of action between the European Union and Ukraine is also important and a clear signal must be given at the earliest opportunity to western and eastern Ukraine, the general public and politicians that, if it meets the stringent entry requirements, the road to membership of the European Union will be open to Ukraine. </p>
<p class="contents">The world has focused its attention on Ukraine; the European Union must now do so. Ukraine should be given the opportunity to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it is now time for the celebrations to end and the hard work to begin. There is work to be done in Ukraine, in order to ensure that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is not wasted and becomes a Pyrrhic victory, but we also have our own homework to do here in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine needs to set itself two objectives. Firstly, it must put democracy on a firm footing, and secondly, it must implement essential and far-reaching economic reforms. Our tasks are as follows. Firstly, Ukraine, as Poland’s closest neighbour and thus a neighbour of the European Union, must be offered a privileged status and an easy-to-understand ‘road map’ of its journey to membership, even if this road will take many years to travel. Secondly, support should be given to reforms of the Ukrainian administration and judiciary, as well as to a genuine reform of the local government system. The Ukrainian authorities should be expected to have a clear vision of these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">President Yushchenko’s first visit will be to Moscow, but I believe Kiev will import standards of democracy and the free market from the West, not the East, as otherwise its road to Brussels will become even longer. There is a long and rocky road ahead of Ukraine, but it is the right road. We should provide assistance and accompany the country on its journey, even when Western television cameras disappear from Ukraine, as they undoubtedly will soon. Ukrainians must carry out the main bulk of the work for themselves, yet they need to know that we are waiting for them and that we do not want to wait too long.</p>

<p class="contents">This was an essentially corrupt alliance between the former communist hierarchy, economic oligarchs, and state bureaucrats. This alliance developed its own ‘guided democracy’ model, originally patented by the Indonesian dictator Sukarno.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Ukraine’s new course towards real democracy is a choice, a choice in favour of fundamentally different values. In the words of Russian political analyst Piontovski, it is a choice between the past and the future, between Soviet Ukraine and European Ukraine. A choice which, according to him, the Russian people will also have to make sooner or later. Europe must be bold in welcoming those choices, and must not be dismayed or disoriented by possible changes in the present balance of power.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be the greatest of tragedies if the people of Ukraine were to become disillusioned in their faith in freedom and justice. It is therefore the duty of the EU to make a long-term commitment to support the reforms in Ukraine and to give the Ukrainian people a European perspective. It is important that the resolution calls for a change in the Neighbourhood Policy action plan in the light of the recent events. We also propose additional measures, such as the convening of a donors’ conference for Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in addition to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we have to offer Ukraine other forms of association that will open the door to closer cooperation. This is in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian people, and could eventually culminate in Ukraine’s accession to the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">The elections were perfectly in line with OSCE standards, and the few irregularities, such as the sudden decision by the Constitutional Court, were handled relatively well. What did, of course, help the elections to be properly conducted was the public interest in Europe and throughout the world, but that public interest and that attention must not flag now, for the democratic process is not yet complete. We observers were impressed by the commitment and determination showed by the citizens – as demonstrated by the high turnout – and not just by experts and elites. We saw a vast number of people walking great distances – as they were obliged to – in order to reach the polling stations.</p>
<p class="contents">What I found impressive and heartening was that the interest and involvement of women in this democratisation process and at the polling stations went without saying. I cannot produce a quotation from the Bible to illustrate that, but these are signs of a society composed of citizens who do not wait for their government’s decisions. I hope that this democratic process will also prove an incentive to Ukraine’s neighbouring states, specifically to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Europe to do now? For a start, the country has been divided and polarised during the election and we must not make these divisions any deeper. Secondly, we must consider what help and what prospects we can give Ukraine. The existing concept of neighbourhood aid will have to be radically rethought if we do not offer the prospect of membership within the next two or three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we must go on pointing out, we owe this victory for democracy to, above all, the Ukrainian people themselves. Day after day and evening after evening, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered and mobilised to demand quite simply that they be able freely to exercise their right to vote. It is thanks to their courage and determination that Ukraine has been able to attain democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also owe this victory to Ukraine’s institutions. I am thinking in particular of Parliament and the Supreme Court which, despite the very many pressures exercised upon them, acted with respect for the law and with a great sense of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a victory for Europe. For once, Europe said ‘no’ by rejecting rigged elections and fraud on a huge scale. When, moreover, we were in Kiev at the beginning of December, we were proud to be Members of the European Parliament. For once, Europe was able to speak with a single voice and, when Europe decides to bring its weight to bear, it comes into its own and is able to change the course of events. Today, the challenges, like the expectations – of reforms and democracy – are huge. Europe has been equal to a tremendous and significant historic event. The Ukrainian people must continue to be able to count on us both now and in the future. We have a responsibility for their being able to do so. We must not, indeed cannot, disappoint them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then, for unexplained reasons, Ukraine is labelled a 'neighbour of Europe' with no prospects for EU membership, only closer integration with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Orange Revolution, which heralded a remarkable change in democratic thinking in Ukraine, occurred without any EU carrots being held out to change its system of government. That contrasts markedly with Turkey and the western Balkans, which are offered full membership – clearly, in my view, a morally unsustainable position in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">I always supported Ukraine's EU-membership aspirations. The denial of EU prospects to Ukraine reflects the unfounded fears in the Council, on the part of the French in particular, of serious agricultural competition, and, on the part of the Germans, of serious industrial competition, notwithstanding the fact that the common agricultural policy will be obsolete by the time Ukraine is ready to join in 10 to 15 years' time, and that industrial relocation is much more likely for a Ukraine in the WTO but outside the EU than it is for a Ukraine as a Member State of the EU with all the onerous single market requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also recommend the OECD to Ukraine, but full OECD membership requires WTO membership first, one of the new government's pressing goals. Curiously, the Commission continues to deny Ukraine – unlike Russia – market economy status. Given the expectations now raised with Ukraine's people, unless the EU accepts that Ukraine can have some kind of long-term aspiration of EU membership, it will be difficult for President Yushchenko to implement the much-needed political and economic reforms and win the parliamentary elections of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">One major policy change that the new government of Ukraine could make and which would demonstrate Kiev's independence from Russia is to help solve the Transnistria problem. That breakaway territory of Moldova is a haven for criminal activity, including money laundering and arms smuggling, and poses a serious security problem for the EU after 2007, when our borders will extend to Moldova. This could be a useful way of showing Brussels that Ukraine really is now independent from Moscow and seriously wants to do business in the international arena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will, as long as it does what is necessary, and as long as we do what is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we have to go much further than President Kuchma’s stagnation-period action plan. We need to concentrate on the essential reforms with which the EU can assist Ukraine, since Ukraine’s achievements during the following two-year-long window of opportunity will largely determine whether Ukraine is cut out for Europe or not. The EU must focus on the practical questions holding Ukraine back: corruption, low administrative capacity, crony capitalism, freedom of the press. Solutions do not just require money, but also thousands of experts from the new EU Member States, which have faced the same problems and have resolved them successfully; their membership of the EU is proof of that. I call on the Commission to considerably extend their development plan for reforms, primarily using citizens and officials from the countries that have successfully implemented the same reforms. We should be pragmatic and use the EU’s human potential to help Ukraine, and we should do so now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Russia’s behaviour throughout the Ukrainian election saga indicates that it is time for the EU to end its ostrich-like policy on Russia. In addition to a significant backslide in democracy and freedom, which according to Freedom House has taken Russia into the <span class="italic">Not Free</span> category, we must not ignore Russia’s foreign policy actions. Just recently, Russia announced that it would not honour the commitment it made at the 1999 OSCE summit in Istanbul to withdraw its troops from Georgia and Moldavia. Russia’s blatant interference in the Ukrainian elections, the growing hostility towards EU institutions, and the unacceptable declaration regarding the EU leaders and officials who resolved the Ukrainian crisis demonstrate that the EU must rethink its policies in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We reacted appropriately and rapidly, and we can be pleased with our efforts. It was not for our own satisfaction that we undertook these efforts, however, but in the clear interest of the European Union, because a stable and democratic Ukraine, with a market economy, is in the interest of the European Union. What can be done to ensure that this is achieved in the long term? The Ukrainians themselves must of course undertake major efforts, and election pledges must be met. We are entitled to expect this of Ukraine, and we can also make the EU’s readiness to open its doors to Ukraine conditional upon it, but we must then ensure that these doors are flung wide open.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, I am astounded by the Commissioner’s speech. It proves that the European Commission has completely failed to grasp the significance of what has happened in Ukraine. How can it be possible to extol the Action Plan’s virtues today, when it was drawn up for a Ukraine that was a completely different country? Ukraine should be offered the prospect of membership, as well as a road map for achieving such membership. This road map should include the following. Firstly, the rapid adoption and implementation of a much-amended and greatly extended Action Plan. Secondly, the urgent organisation of a donors’ conference, along the lines of the one organised by the European Commission and the World Bank for Georgia in April of last year. If EUR 861 million could be raised for Georgia, then it should be possible to raise an amount many times greater for Ukraine, a country of 48 million inhabitants. This project should be negotiated with US partners and the World Bank. Finally, preparations must be made for talks on an Association Agreement, as the recent enlargement taught us that this is the right instrument to use in order to achieve stabilisation and open the doors to future membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was deployed in a rural area about 80 kilometres from Kiev and saw, as any individual observer does, only a microcosm of the story across the whole country. However, I also saw the overall picture as reported by the OSCE election observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there was an essential integrity to this election that was lacking in the earlier one. The margin of victory was of an order of magnitude greater than any possible margin of fraud. It was clear that the majority of Ukrainians had chosen Mr Yushchenko and not Mr Yanukovych as their President. It was essentially a victory for the urban intelligentsia and the rural population over the urban working class. Yet at the same time it was also victory for cleaner politics over deeply soiled politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The celebrations in Independence Square in Kiev on Boxing Day evening, welcoming the rebirth of democracy in Ukraine, were an inspiration. I welcome the election result as an affirmation of democracy, even if doubts remain over all aspects of the social and economic programme espoused by President Yushchenko. The EU will need to look again at its engagement with Ukraine, at least in terms of quality, if not in terms of quantity. At the same time, if Ukraine is not to be torn apart between east and west, rural and urban, President Yushchenko must seek to build bridges, not with the deeply flawed politicians that preceded him, but with the constituencies that they represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have also carefully considered the criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will say a few words about what the European Neighbourhood Policy entails and, after that, I will provide clarification on the action plan, that is to say, I will look at its substance and how to proceed with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Neighbourhood Policy is a major step forward for the countries concerned, in the relations between these countries and the European Union. It is a very ambitious policy which entails a substantive upgrading of our relationship with partners through deeper political cooperation and a significant degree of economic integration, bringing partners closer to the internal market. Implementing this policy with Ukraine – the EU-Ukraine Action Plan – would send a strong message that the EU places great importance on the relationship and acknowledges Kiev's European orientation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is truly distinct from the issue of possible further enlargement of the EU but does not close any doors.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the action plan, let me stress the importance of making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing the EU's relationship with Ukraine. It would be difficult to say that an action plan is an outdated instrument before we have actually used it and implemented it in any countries. It is truly a new instrument which should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main characteristics of an action plan? It is true that, in principle, its approach is the same for all countries. However, it is highly flexible, always tailor-made for the country concerned and, with the concrete proposals on which the Commission and the Council are already working, we can go as far as the country concerned wants and can afford. I can assure you that, in the case of Ukraine, the Commission is ready to go far.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying again – because it is an important message – that the EU has repeatedly acknowledged and welcomed Ukraine's European aspirations. The recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed that country's place on the European map. We have no doubt that these events will go down in history as a milestone not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
