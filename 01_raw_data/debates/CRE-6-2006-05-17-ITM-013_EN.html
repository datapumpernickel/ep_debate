<p class="contents">I wish to begin by expanding on the objects of our two questions to the Council and to the Commission. I should emphasise that they are <span class="italic">our </span>questions – although it is gratifying to see my name on them, the questions are on behalf of my committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to see that the Presidency is able to be present after all. I appreciate that this may have caused inconvenience, but holding this debate at this time presents some inconvenience to me as well: I could be elsewhere consuming asparagus.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Council has changed the original Commission proposal with regard to the role of the European Parliament from the consultation procedure to simply informing Parliament of any decision of the Council, I am bound to ask why the Council appears to be trying to bypass or circumvent Parliament. What could the Council have to hide? In the context of the apparent reluctance to be present here tonight, the substance of our question has added relevance. Therefore, allow me to remind the Council representative, Mr Winkler, of our two specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is: what mechanism would the Council envisage for <span class="italic">ex ante</span> informing of Parliament prior to the adoption of a position by the Council with regard to the Energy Community Treaty institutions? Secondly, by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed <span class="italic">ex ante</span> of the position taken by the representatives of the European Community in the organs of the Energy Community Treaty, such as the Permanent High Level Group? Before the House is invited to vote on the recommendation on the Energy Community Treaty tomorrow, we need some answers and assurances from the Council on these points, and I and others will be listening carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Because this is a very important matter, the proposed Treaty creates an interesting precedent in extending the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in a limited and very specific field to third countries, albeit that two of them should be joining the European Union very shortly or others are in various stages of negotiating accession.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important because energy is currently perceived as a very important issue, largely as a result of events at the beginning of this year. Those events were rather like throwing a large stone into a pond, creating ripples. Energy is vital to our way of life, vital to our quality of life and vital to our standard of living, so how we organise markets and safeguard security of supply is equally important.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question to the Commission, I should like to acknowledge from the outset the high level of cooperation and the positive response to our concerns that we have received from Commissioner Piebalgs. Indeed, I welcome his open and constructive approach in meetings and in the recent letter with regard to the issues of informing Parliament about the activities of the Energy Community and addressing some of the concerns of my committee over social and human rights issues. I trust that the Council will endorse his offer to inform Parliament in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues. I welcome his letter’s assertion that he considers it of the utmost importance that Parliament is fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I come to the specific points contained in our questions to the Commission, which I feel still require a response. The Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty lays down in its Article 4(3) the provisions for providing ‘mutual assistance in the event of disruption’ – see the Treaty’s Title IV, Chapter IV. Yet the same article of the decision stipulates that: ‘in the event of special circumstances’ the position of the European Community ‘may go beyond the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’. So the first question is: what might these special circumstances be? The second question is: what is meant by the phrase, it ‘may go beyond the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’? I ask the Commissioner to put some flesh on those two issues for us.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point – by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed <span class="italic">ex ante</span> of the position taken by the Commission within the various organs of the Energy Community Treaty – has been answered in general terms in the Commissioner’s letter. However, I invite him to share any further thoughts he may have with Parliament on detailed implementation of these undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to the crux of the matter: whether Parliament should vote for the recommendation. Let me say that I recognise the good intention of the Commission in offering to brief my committee about the work undertaken in the preparation and negotiation of this Treaty, although our reaction might have been more welcoming and less suspicious of what was being proposed had it not come out of the blue without any prior knowledge on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recognise and appreciate the Commission’s efforts to persuade the Council to take this Treaty down the assent procedure route instead of, as it were, slipping it through on the nod. However, I am bound to observe that this was after we began raising questions about possible empire-building by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This Treaty could provide an important message to the countries of south-east Europe, and even beyond, that the EU is capable of being outward-looking and wants to embrace them in the family of European nations. I am not entirely sure how much comfort Bulgaria will derive from this, given the earlier decision to force early closure of Kozloduy – a decision which no longer has any technical justification in my view, but maybe this Treaty could help offset that negative message.</p>
<p class="contents">I close by expressing the hope that the Council in particular will be able to give us sufficient comfort this evening so that we can proceed to a favourable vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans Winkler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to say that it is indeed a pleasure for me to participate in this debate on a question that I consider very important, because in the eyes of the Council the subject matter is very important. I was not invited to feast on asparagus tonight, so my destiny is an easier one than yours; but as a Permanent Representative of Austria to the Council of Europe I had the pleasure for five years to be invited to those feasts.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, and with my apologies to Mr Chichester, I shall continue in German; but I hope that I will be able to give comprehensive answers to the questions that were put to the Council. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council does indeed consider the Treaty establishing the Energy Community between the European Community and the countries of South-East Europe to be an important instrument, for obvious reasons: security of the electricity and gas supply to the European Community and also to the contracting parties in the region. This subject came to the attention of the Austrian Presidency somewhat dramatically only a few hours after, at 8 a.m. on 1 January, gas supplies were cut not only to Ukraine and Moldova, but also to Central Europe. That made us all acutely aware of how desperate the situation had become.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee quite rightly notes, one of the objectives of this Treaty is the extension of the EC energy market to the countries of the region through their implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>on energy, environment, competition and renewables. This strikes me as particularly important in the interests of the homogeneity and coherence of a pan-European strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the Energy Community Treaty is characterised by the fact that one of the most important aspects of the work of the bodies it envisages is the implementation of the relevant provisions of Community law. In addition, Article 25 of this Treaty provides that measures may be taken to implement amendments to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, in line with the evolution of European Community law. This dynamic reference also strikes me as very important. The Council would like to emphasise that this means, of course, that Parliament is directly involved from the outset in the preparation of Community rules and the adoption of these rules by both of our institutions under the codecision procedure. Therefore, these are rules that are then to be incorporated into the framework of the Energy Community Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of Parliament’s role in the adoption of the Energy Community Treaty is also reflected in the choice of legal basis, that is to say, in the fact that Parliament has a right of assent, as stated in Article 300(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. We are not just talking about a right of consultation, therefore. The Council’s amendment to the Commission proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty to which the honourable Member Mr Chichester’s question relates concerns the role of the European Parliament in decision-making. The Council has indeed deleted Article 5(3) of the proposal, which had provided for the consultation procedure. It should be pointed out, however, that the Commission proposal had envisaged consultation of the European Parliament only in a single specific case, namely that of the establishment of positions of the European Communities on decisions to be taken by the Energy Community pursuant to Article 100(iii) of the Energy Community Treaty; that is to say, decisions on the extension of this Treaty to other energy products and carriers or other essential network infrastructures. In other words, under the Commission proposal, the Commission would present the Council with a draft relating to the establishment of a Community position on this kind of amendment of the Energy Community Treaty, and the Council would then have to consult Parliament on this position. Such a procedure is not provided for in the EC Treaty, however, and so would be in addition to its procedures and thus alter its institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the EC Treaty, more specifically Article 300(2)(3), provides that the European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed. However, even though the EC Treaty does not provide for <span class="italic">ex ante</span> informing of Parliament in the event of a scenario such as the one I have just described: for example, the extension of the Energy Community Treaty – where the deletion is relevant – the Presidency of Parliament will provide regular information on all the important aspects of the proposed Council position.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say in this connection that, as the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will remember, the last Council Presidencies that dealt with this issue informed Parliament, within the framework of their speeches to this Committee, on the state of affairs with regard to the Energy Community Treaty. I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in certain cases, particularly when this is necessary for reasons of political importance, there is nothing to prevent the Council from consulting Parliament on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the Energy Community Treaty chiefly extends the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in whose adoption Parliament is fully involved. Let me now turn to the decision-making process in the bodies of the Energy Community and to the positions to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House is aware, the institutional framework of the Energy Community consists of the Ministerial Council, the Permanent High Level Group and the Regulatory Board. Parliament is not directly involved in the decision-making process agreed with the parties to the Energy Community Treaty. However, Article 52 of this Treaty provides that the Ministerial Council must present Parliament, and also the national parliaments of the contracting parties, with an annual report on the work of the Energy Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the position to be adopted by the European Community in these bodies, this is laid down in Article 4 of the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty and is adopted by the Council pursuant to the relevant provisions of the EC Treaty. One important aspect of this decision-making process is the requirement for Community positions on Energy Community decisions falling under Titles III and IV of the Energy Community Treaty to be in line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, with the exception of measures falling under Chapter IV of Title IV of the said Treaty, which concerns mutual assistance in the event of disruption of energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Parliament’s involvement, Article 4(5) of the proposal for a Council decision stipulates – as proposed by the Commission – that Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed of any decision of the Council on the establishment of Community positions to be taken in the three bodies of the Energy Community Treaty. There is no formal requirement for <span class="italic">ex ante</span> informing of Parliament, but it is the Presidency’s firm intention to inform Parliament regularly. The Commission will also be required to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition – and the Council will take this into account – the position taken by Parliament once it has been informed will certainly influence the future decisions of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this speech not only answers the honourable Member’s questions, but also allays any fears that Parliament is not duly involved. At all events, I can emphasise once more on behalf of the Council that it is important to us that Parliament is regularly informed and involved regarding not only all the issues in which its involvement is a constitutional right, of course, but also all the issues concerning the functioning of this Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, before answering the questions put to me, I would like to start by explaining the global approach towards the Energy Community. We know, and there is some consensus, that the two main routes for enhancing energy security in the European Union are diversification and the strengthening of market forces. Extensions of the EU’s own market to include our neighbours would gradually create around the EU a shared regulatory area with common trade, transit and environmental rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present a successful initiative in the region of south-east Europe. It is not only because of its needs that the European Union acted in this area. The disintegration of the former Yugoslav energy system has brought havoc to the regional market, by breaking electricity connections, disrupting trade routes and forcing the system to work – on a chronic basis – far beyond its capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, industrial decline and population shifts have made demand much more capricious and more varied, so the technical challenges of keeping the system alive were preventing development and a fresh start. Indeed, some European Union aid was being used to buy electricity and fuel oil for immediate consumption. Such a situation could not go on.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these immediate needs, the Commission made a strategic decision to look at the long-term needs, to gather international consensus for a way forward and create a real basis for post-war cooperation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I can present to the European Parliament the results of our joint work. It is valuable to the stabilisation and economic development of these countries. Within ten years we have gone from war to cooperative management of the most essential sector of the economy: energy. Along the way we have faced difficulties and sometimes scepticism. And I have to thank Parliament for assisting us in overcoming these difficulties. I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues we have been discussing are not only related to investments. We have also addressed environmental and social issues in our debate. So the creation of the Energy Community for south-east Europe clearly responds to the needs of the region and of the whole EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the question. Firstly, the Energy Community Treaty provides for a procedure ensuring cooperation and mutual assistance of the parties in the event of disruption of gas or electricity supply affecting a party. This is quite an important clause. One example is the recent gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, but also, for instance, the blackout in Italy in 2003, which demonstrated the need for solidarity among European countries, and the importance and the benefits that such a solidarity clause could have in the energy sector. I would also recall that this winter Serbia’s gas supplies were cut off for quite a considerable time.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the draft conclusion decision, the positions that can be taken by the European Community under Title IV of the Energy Community Treaty, providing for the creation of a single energy market between the European Community and the countries of south-east Europe and containing the mutual assistance clause, have to be inspired by the existing <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">As mutual assistance may not be fully covered by the existing <span class="italic">acquis </span>– and in some cases our <span class="italic">acquis </span>is perhaps not ambitious enough – it was important to introduce some flexibility to this limitation as regards the mutual assistance clause. The reference to specific circumstances allows for this flexibility. It will, ultimately, be up to the Council to decide by qualified majority, whether or not the specific circumstances are met on a case-by-case basis. In my view, this concerns situations of extreme gravity and extreme disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course any measure concerning the mutual assistance clause will have to remain within the external competence of the European Community. Let me highlight, in that regard, that decisions of the Energy Community on mutual assistance have to be taken by unanimity so that the European Community will have a veto on all decisions to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me stress that, through its proposal to the Council, the Commission has steadily acted in favour of an increased role of Parliament as regards the ratification of the Energy Community Treaty. In this regard, once the Treaty has entered into force, I consider it of utmost importance that Parliament be fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community.</p>
<p class="contents">To this effect, Parliament will be informed in advance of each semi-annual Ministerial Council of the European Energy Community. I have also instructed my services to ensure that Parliament is informed in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues and that it has full access to the Energy Community’s documents. There are no restrictions on official documents of the Energy Community and all policy documents are placed on the Energy Community website. These documents are accessible to all those who have an interest in them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as provided for in the Treaty, the Energy Community’s Ministerial Council will, on an annual basis, submit a report on the activities of the Energy Community to the European Parliament and all other national parliaments involved, as the President-in-Office mentioned. In line with the proposed Conclusion Decisions, the Commission will further submit to Parliament, every three years, a report on the Energy Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my answers to the questions are satisfactory. I would also like to mention the issues referred to by the honourable Member with regard to Kozloduy, because I would like to separate this issue from the Energy Community Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy chapter with Bulgaria was closed in 2002 and both sides have agreed to close that chapter on the basis that units 3 and 4 of Kozloduy will be closed on the grounds of safety requirements. That means we have provided aid for Bulgaria to deal with this situation. So I would not make a connection between these two issues, because the decisions have been taken by mutual understanding and we have done quite substantial work to help Bulgaria deal with the consequences of the closure of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy power station. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An exchange of information is obviously vital. I would like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his particularly active cooperation with Parliament. Today, after the conflict in January, we know that energy security is not simply a problem affecting individual Member States, and not simply a challenge for the European Union as a whole. We need a pan-European approach to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Energy Community Treaty is a step in the right direction. It foresees an integrated gas and energy market in part of Europe, facilitates investment and increases the security of gas supplies to the European Union. However, the Treaty also stipulates that investment decisions will be transferred from a national to a centralised level, as this method is more productive, both in terms of costs and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the Treaty is a good solution. It demonstrates that energy security requires a new approach, also in terms of European Union foreign policy. It is also a good legal instrument with which to manage energy relations with Ukraine, which intends to sign the Treaty. The European Parliament has, on numerous occasions, emphasised the importance of securing energy supplies on the basis of harmonious cooperation between the European Union Member States, which requires the legislative solutions announced by the Commission at the start of this year. It is vital for this cooperation to exist within as well as outside the European Union, namely with third countries, in such a way as to avoid interfering with the interests of individual countries and not to exclude any Member State from the proposed solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Energy Community Treaty, signed in October, integrates nine countries in south-east Europe with our energy market. That is a historic event in at least two senses.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is a precedent, as for the first time it will extend legislation on the single market for the electricity and gas sector to nine countries outside the Union. Secondly, it is the first multilateral agreement that applies to the whole of south-east Europe since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. It will take much cooperation, but will thus stabilise the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing the Energy Community is in many ways a rational and justifiable project. The energy sector in the Balkan region is undeveloped and continues to suffer the consequences of a war that took place a decade ago. There are frequent power cuts and there is no secure source of energy available. Furthermore, the environment is suffering on account of old power stations and their emissions and, in addition, the lack of investment and lack of competition both pose serious problems. The purpose of the Energy Community Treaty is to develop the energy infrastructure with the help of loans granted by financial institutions. It is estimated that around EUR 25-30 billion will be needed for investment in the electricity sector over the next 10 years. The fact is that a viable and reliable energy system will also tempt investors, which will result in the region’s economic situation developing, improved general stability and a reduction in emigration. Moreover, it is important for the Union to improve reliability of the energy supply (we are also speaking from our own point of view) and reduce dependence on single suppliers. The Balkan region is also an important route to the Middle East energy in the Caspian region.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also causes for concern. In spite of the energy in south-east Europe being at present underpriced, much of the population cannot afford to purchase electricity. When the energy sector becomes market-based, it will be capitalised, so prices will inevitably rise. The parties to the Treaty should therefore ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled and that prices are reasonable, so that the poor too can afford electricity and gas. Parliament insists that the parties should sign a legally binding protocol. This kind of binding commitment is important. The single market must apply standards, in the areas of working conditions and social equality, for example, especially as we are talking about an energy sector that will be making massive profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, there have been concerns, and the helpful letter from Commissioner Piebalgs does not entirely answer these. It is not clear whether the ECT states will be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is not clear whether the internal market will be underpinned by health, safety and employment standards, as it is in the EU. It is not clear whether there will be any control of the demand side of energy, as there is through EU energy efficiency legislation, or whether environmental considerations, such as the control of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, have been given adequate attention. There will be no level playing field if these standards are absent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of corruption in the energy sector. To give just one example, in 2005 the British Serious Fraud Office investigated the involvement of a British company in the Serb state power company following allegations that corrupt money was being used to protect war criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of all these concerns, it is understandable that the European Parliament should wish to be both informed and consulted in advance of decisions. I regret that Parliament does not yet have codecision in this area and I wish that there was a Constitution in place so that it would have; but it is an outrage that the consultation mechanism could be downgraded.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the reassurances from Commissioner Piebalgs that he will keep Parliament informed in advance, but we need similar cast-iron reassurances from the Council too. Nevertheless, being informed is not the same as being consulted. Given the serious nature of the questions hanging over the Energy Community Treaty, it would be deeply regrettable if Parliament were sidelined. There could effectively be no democratic oversight of this Treaty, because it is clear – not least from what the Council has said tonight – that the real decisions will be taken by the unelected Permanent High Level Group rather than by ministers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our view, all the signatories to the Treaty should actually make an unqualified declaration of belief in European fundamental rights or, in other words, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. We believe that it is absolutely necessary, including to prevent disruption in the energy market towards which we are striving, that the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding – impact in the fields of employment, social standards, working conditions, health and the environment – be given a binding legal basis. The Commission and the Council need to take very seriously the call for these to be made binding.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, it is very important that this Treaty not enable or pursue energy strategies that would have been appropriate 20 years ago at best. We believe that energy efficiency must be a very important concern in this new Treaty and that the market that we are intending to create should not be geared towards demand alone. In accordance with the discussion on greater autonomy in Europe’s energy supply, consideration for renewable energy must be central in all regions under this Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We greatly fear that privatising the sector too quickly and without proper consideration could be harmful. We have had experience with privatisation of state monopolies that was carried out too quickly, and believe that the Commission must bear in mind that the public interest in privatisation and the strategies to carry this out needs to be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with his introductory analysis and speech, including the questions he posed. As regards the Treaty itself, in my opinion we have succeeded in establishing an acceptable platform for bringing together countries that are not yet EU Member States in a given region, on the grounds of solving energy issues, with a view to their achieving EU compatibility. Given that I am not an uncritical advocate of the all-powerful liberalisation of the market, I welcome the fact that the Commission has expressed the intention of dealing with related social aspects in a separate memorandum, which I take to be a good sign, and not only for the citizens of the region concerned. Interconnection of energy markets undoubtedly translates into greater security of energy supplies both in south-eastern Europe and in the whole of the Union. I do not, however, share the great optimism that the process of interconnecting the markets will lead to cheaper energy; at least this has not happened in the Czech Republic. I should like to make one final remark. I believe that the time has come to address the issue of setting up an independent European control centre for transmission networks, with a view to solving operational problems, in particular relating to the supply of electricity in EU Member States and their immediate neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The internal market is the most important source of prosperity that the EU provides us with. It is also, without doubt, important for the internal market that we link up gas and electricity networks, including in south-east Europe. As we have heard from a large number of speakers in the Chamber, this would reduce the risk of disruptions in one production unit knocking out large areas. There would be stability. It is truly excellent that we can also look forward to having regulatory authorities of an international nature. Perhaps people in the region will also learn to cooperate with each other and thus minimise the risks of violent conflicts of the type seen in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">So far so good – but then comes the poison arrow. All of a sudden, one reads in the report that if we have a common market then this naturally leads to a common external policy. This is not at all the case, but it is possible misleadingly to make use of such an inference. What we have here is precisely such an abuse in the grand tradition of Jean Monnet. Instead of having an open debate about the pros and cons of a common external policy, such a policy is sneaked in in a completely different context. This is a very common technique.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, we know that the people of Europe do not want more supranationalism. This fact is revealed the minute the will of the people is allowed to show itself through popular referendums instead of being filtered through the political establishment. I contend that the text concerning a common external policy should be expunged. Solutions to energy problems in south-east Europe should not be used as a means to promote such a policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth stating this, because success stories of this nature are particularly rare; today, the combination of politics and energy is more likely to generate conflicts rather than diffuse them. We could illustrate this with countless examples, from the manoeuvres of Russia, potentially endangering the gas supply of the European Union, to the Bolivian nationalisations, so enthusiastically celebrated the other day by the leftist Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Energy Community Treaty is a refreshing exception, and a true European success story that the European Union can be proud of. As the result of three years of consistent and persevering efforts, our goal can finally materialise: we can cooperate in the modernisation and rebuilding of the energy supply of the war-torn Balkan region which is of such crucial importance to the safety of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, naturally agree with this goal, just like I also support and require that the controlling role of Parliament in respect of the Treaty is ensured. One of my reasons for this is that I am convinced that the stabilisation of the energy sector in the Balkans will facilitate the diversification of EU energy supplies. I trust that the Treaty will give a fresh impetus to the implementation of the Nabucco gas pipeline project, which is meant to serve this purpose, and may be decisive in relieving the unilateral dependence of Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, on gas imports from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that all these things can be achieved, and that the creation of the Energy Community will be a tangible argument for the single European energy policy, also supported by the Green Paper. If this is achieved, the European Union can produce further energy success stories, and will continue to set an example of an attractive political community to its neighbouring countries and regions wishing to bridge the gap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The balance between the two parts is lost when it concerns the Energy Community Treaty. For instance, does the Treaty not include participation of the social partners? On other occasions Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the importance of social dialogue. Early participation of the social partners in the relevant sectoral dialogue committees, like those in the electricity and mining sectors, has been positive for the social partners in the new Member States. We know that liberalisation of the internal market for electricity and gas will necessitate many structural changes and new challenges for the companies and the workforce, as also for the citizens, with regard to affordable prices and security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand a commitment on the part of the participating countries to respect and implement the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I hope that the Commission and the Council will work towards a good memorandum, with legally binding statutes that also secure democratic control over the sector. They should, furthermore, guarantee to oversee the work of the regulatory authorities and the resources and consultation processes of the relevant stakeholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political ramifications in this case are quite another, and here it is a written document that matters. The EU employs the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> as one of the founding principles to which all its Member States have solemnly signed. How can this be extended to countries which are not even candidates yet?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU suggests going beyond the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and overriding due process in the event of special circumstances. What are these circumstances? How short are your memories? We heard this excuse before. It led to a conflagration from which we are suffering still and to evils which we still do not comprehend.</p>
<p class="contents">You may know that I do not wish my country to be part of the EU, but currently it is and I am a democrat. This House of properly-elected deputies should be consulted and should be the final arbiter, deleting the provision requiring the Council to consult Parliament before adoption of the Commission’s position excludes this House from any meaningful debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all about enlargement by the back door. Page 6 of the recommendation draws a parallel with the Coal and Steel Community and how it started the EEC as it then was. That being the case, why not say so? Why keep it secret? Excluding Parliament, special circumstances decided by an unelected body, secretive motives: all are the beginnings of totalitarianism. No, please do not scoff, because that kind of attitude is exactly how all the demagogues and dictators down the ages got away with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not the case that we are handing these countries something on a plate, as it were – as the EU, too, benefits. As Mr Buzek and others have also said, an important point is that this is a pan-European issue rather than one that concerns only the countries of South-East Europe or only the EU – an integrated energy market certainly could not function like this. This Treaty contributes not only to energy security and energy supply but, generally, to increased stability in Europe. As you know, the Austrian Presidency, in particular, has attempted in recent months to step up cooperation with the countries of South-East Europe and of the Western Balkans, to make some progress in the interests of stability and peace in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is potentially very interesting to recall that the Energy Community Treaty was consciously modelled on the European Coal and Steel Community – which, as you know, was the genesis for the European Union. Members such as Mr Paasilinna have also mentioned here that the Energy Community Treaty enables the very local and specific energy and environmental concerns of South-East Europe to be addressed. A number of speakers have raised environmental concerns, such as increased mortality rates from winter cold, environmental degradation as a result of emissions from old power stations, the use of wood for domestic heating that results in deforestation, and the unsustainable use of wetlands and watercourses for hydroelectric power. </p>
<p class="contents">As has also been mentioned in the course of the debate, it is in Europe’s interests to think beyond the South-East European region – an example given here was the Caspian Sea. I should like to mention in this connection that the Presidency sent a Troika mission to Kazakhstan to meet representatives of all the Central Asian countries, and also sent a mission to the Southern Caucasus. Naturally, the energy issue – both the producer and the transit-country aspects – is particularly important in both of these regions. Other points raised here have concerned Nabucco, for example: this is another important project that will benefit the security of Europe’s energy supply. </p>
<p class="contents">Doubts have been expressed, too, and that is reasonable, of course – but I believe that the issue of this Treaty must be seen in conjunction with the overall endeavours of the EU as regards this region of South-East Europe. I should like to remind the House that all the countries who are party to this Treaty are involved in the stabilisation and association process, which, of course, also comprises respect for human rights, fundamental rights and other EU provisions. Indeed, the purpose of the network of agreements we have made with South-East Europe is to introduce these countries to EU values, too, which naturally includes the values enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the Energy Community is a unique achievement, a successful project, one that we wish to remain successful. I have also sensed that in most of your speeches. Furthermore, there is no doubt that Europe must speak with one voice to third countries on energy policy, and that the process of integrating our neighbouring countries into the European single market should be continued. As I said in my introductory speech, I wish to make it crystal clear that Parliament naturally has a central, an important role to play in this, and that there can be no question of the Council’s attempting to curtail Parliament’s rights – which we could not do anyway, owing to the interinstitutional structure; on the contrary, we have an active interest in due involvement by, and joint action with, Parliament. That is why we shall be involving Parliament in all the important issues regarding the Energy Community: in accordance with the EC Treaty, but also, as I have said, taking a very broad interpretation of its provisions. In addition, Parliament will always be fully informed of developments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I really believe that Turkey is close to joining the Community. It has been working towards this since the creation of the Community. It has not signed up to it, but we shall continue to work with it. It is quite important for Turkey as a candidate country – we have started negotiations with it and it is also a very important transit country – that it could and should sign this Treaty. Two countries – Ukraine and Moldova – have also expressed interest in joining.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of affordability is very important because energy prices should be accessible to the citizens of these countries. Article 33 of Chapter IV addresses this issue as far as the Community can address it. In the process of creating the Community we have devoted attention to social issues. I agree that the social approach in Europe should definitely be directed more closely at countries that aspire to a vision that may one day come much closer to that of the European Union. A memorandum of understanding is a good first step in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have looked carefully at renewables and energy efficiency: Chapter VI addresses this issue. On Kyoto, Article 13 in Chapter III – even if it does not say very much – covers this and the provisions on renewables and energy efficiency in the Treaty will definitely help to achieve the Kyoto goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning privatisation, the Community does not impose any type of action in this area: any decision on privatisation will be taken by these countries’ governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning prices, I think these countries are already paying extremely high prices for energy. An Energy Community could bring down prices because of the new investments it will bring in. It will also help with regard to collecting payments, because there is a lot of money owed. There is also diversification: these regions pay some of the highest gas prices to the supplier. The supplier in these regions does not worry too much about price affordability. This means that the Energy Community could bring much more stability – at least to prices – and could even reduce prices for consumers. In addition, an <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> brings public service obligations, which means addressing issues for the more vulnerable people in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Investments from the World Bank – the EIB is also very active in this region – and other investors will come as soon as the Treaty is approved and ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there has been some misunderstanding about foreign policy. This Treaty does not address that issue at all. The Treaty states that in some cases when energy is bought from third countries, the Energy Community could apply some restrictions if these countries neglect the environment or social issues. This provides an opportunity. This Treaty in no way restricts the powers of the countries that participate in the Treaty to take independent foreign policy decisions. It is very fair to look at these issues, because we cannot afford, if we want to promote sustainability, to buy energy from a third country where environmental standards are neglected and, as a result, the price of energy resources is perhaps cheaper. So I think there has been some misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I really believe that this Treaty serves the interests of the region and of the European Community and I really hope that the countries that participate in this Community will benefit greatly from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
