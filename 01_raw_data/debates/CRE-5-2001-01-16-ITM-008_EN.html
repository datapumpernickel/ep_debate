Many previous attempts have, of course, been made to use frontier workers’ problems as a way in to harmonising tax legislation as a whole. However, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten knows that frontier workers do not even constitute half a per cent of the labour force, that their problems are different from one frontier region to another and that different regional solutions are therefore needed if frontier workers are to have a better time of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I can speak from personal experience, having spent 25 years commuting between Denmark and Sweden. We have now acquired a bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö, and everyone expects a sharp increase in cross-border commuting and for the two cities to become a conurbation It was here that, in 1997 on the initiative of the Danes, the EU-supported principle was introduced of taxing people in the country in which they work. This means that people can take up residence in Malmö and have access to health care, child care, education and everything else, at the same time as paying all their tax to the Danish State. That is quite intolerable if we are to have a common Öresund region.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative recommended by Swedish politicians is the OECD model for frontier taxation, which advocates that tax should be levied in the country of residence. That principle too causes problems, however, because much more than families’ social welfare is financed through tax.</p>
<p class="contents">For ourselves in the Öresund region, it would in actual fact be best if we were to pay local tax where we live and State tax where we work. I think that would put an end to tax avoidance and to cheating in frontier regions. However, a model such as that, too, would require some form of fine tuning in order to create an entirely fair situation, for these are complicated issues. It is therefore crucial for solutions to be worked out in the affected regions themselves, and on the basic principle that frontier workers must pay tax in the country in which they enjoy their benefits financed through tax. Only in that way will long-lasting solutions be obtained. It is essential to adopt a principle of this kind if Öresund is to become a common region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to comment on Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the content of the report, particularly the part which calls for an analysis of the impact of changes to the laws of the Member States on Regulation 1408, relating to people who have worked in more than one State, and especially that part of the regulation which concerns rules for the payment of the pensions of people who have worked in more than one State. We are discussing the problems of cross-border workers: of course we refer to European Union workers but also, indirectly, to relations between the States which have associated themselves with Regulation 1408, that is with the EEA – the European Economic Area – in other words Italy and Switzerland. I regret to say that the Italy-Switzerland Convention and the ensuing regulation have been misinterpreted by the Italian Government, which has hitherto paid the pensions of people who have worked in both Italy and Switzerland according to the scale of half of half the amount, that is a quarter of the amount owed, as laid down by Italian magistrates, judges and courts. I call upon the European Parliament to intervene to stop workers being forced always to institute legal proceedings to obtain their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, Mr President, this situation prevents the people living and working on the borders of the various European Union countries fully experiencing the notion of European integration we champion, even though these are the people who should be the first to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a habit in this House of lauding to the skies the issue of free movement of persons and, hence, of workers. Yet, while there are still obstacles to this, particularly in terms of tax and social security, there are also other matters to be considered. I believe that this issue is inconsistent with the principles of freedom and liberalism which we are considering, even though we seem able to find perfectly good solutions to problems when it relates to the free movement of capital and of goods. This represents a major obstacle to the principle of the free movement of persons and the principal of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this report is a real booster shot in relation to previous reports. We should at least ensure that there is no need to produce many more reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remind the Member States of their responsibilities and ask them to undertake a thorough evaluation of policies which result in upholding systems which have an adverse affect on the situation of frontier workers. We agree with the general thrust of the report but the reincorporation of certain amendments waters down the ambitions which we should be adopting. Bilateral agreements, which, for example, relate to tax or social security, should be perfectly consistent and it is simply not a matter of taking varying provisions into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to sum up by repeating that an accurate inventory should be proposed, listing situations giving rise to prejudice, or even discrimination but also one which would make it possible to clamp down on the fraud which occurs at present. We await the Council’s guidelines in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to reduce the problems experienced by frontier workers. I am familiar with the problems from Southern Jutland, where it is worth noting how few people live on one side of the Danish-German border and work on the other side. I think this illustrates how major the obstacles in practice are. That is why I think it is a good idea to try to get the Member States to continually assess the effects upon frontier workers whenever they change tax and social security legislation. In my opinion, we cannot, however, require governments to compensate frontier workers financially for changes in legislation. It is better to heighten awareness not only of the problems there have always been, but also of new problems that might arise. I should also like to support the view that we should do more to simplify Regulation 1408/71. This is a very far-reaching problem, but one of great importance to many people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the work she has done. Secondly, my contribution should of course be considered as an appeal to the Social Council and the Commission, but mainly the Social Council, to do something about this dossier at long last, particularly in the knowledge that this is the start of the necessary deregulation of the movement of workers across Europe. Frontier work falls under free movement, and will grow, especially once the candidate countries have joined.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, there are still major problems to contend with. Especially in my own country and a number of neighbouring countries, Belgium and Germany, I notice that different groups wish to apply different principles. Foundations involved with frontier workers argue in favour of the principle of the country of residence, trade unions support the principle of the country of employment, the government itself believes in the principle of the country of residence, and so it goes on. It is about time we made a decision, and in that sense, we are unwilling to support a number of amendments which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten tabled, and which are partly designed to adopt a mixed approach. We suggest using the principle of the country of employment as point of departure, and to develop this so-called European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems. The report is further evidence that Regulation 1408/71 requires thorough revision and simplification, proposals for which have been before the Council for two years. We can, therefore, once again regret the lack of success in obtaining more majority voting at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice. The Danish Social Democrats broadly agree with most of what the rapporteur says, but I completely and utterly disagree with her when she sees it as a problem that ever more features of national social insurance are financed through public funds. Regulation 1408/71 concerns the coordination, and not the harmonisation, of social security arrangements, and it is important to make this clear. I should like to emphasise this, because it is precisely this form of argument which has given an unwarranted boost to those Danish opponents of the EU who maintain that the EU is eroding the Danish welfare system. It is partly those who organise resistance to the EU who are purposefully working to ensure that nothing at all happens in this area. They seem to forget that the Council’s incapacity for action does in fact have consequences – consequences for those people and their families who work across national frontiers and who are plagued by uncertainty. However, one further consequence of the Council’s incapacity to act is, in actual fact, that it is the courts, instead of the politicians responsible, who take the decisions. The Eurosceptics talk such a lot about democracy, but it can never be democratic to omit to take the necessary decisions and, in that way, to consign people to insecurity and to give the courts a degree of influence which politicians ought to have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and, in particular, the social and fiscal problems these workers face. I should also like to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals, the proposal to modernise and simplify that regulation, and for the encouraging support given to the Eures network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports your concerns as regards the problems encountered by frontier workers. I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to now set out briefly the Commission's approach to the points raised in the resolution. First, on social security and the labour market, the report calls on the Commission, before the end of this year, to organise an international conference for the Member States and applicant countries concerning the position of frontier workers. This is an excellent idea and advantage can be taken of the experience accumulated under the Eures network. Such a conference could identify best practices and initiatives that could be launched both at Community and national level, and the European Parliament will be involved in its organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the idea of coordination provisions for supplementary pensions, I would remind you that the Commission has committed itself in its social policy agenda to propose in 2002 a directive on the transferability of supplementary pensions. This initiative will complement the already existing directive in this field, which was adopted in 1998. As the proposal will be based on Article 42 of the EC Treaty and rely on the codecision procedure for its adoption, Parliament will be fully involved. Furthermore I can confirm that a study covering the extent and nature of frontier work is already planned to be carried out under the Eures auspices in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">On the initiatives taken by social security agencies for closer cross-border cooperation in order to facilitate access to health-care benefits, I am very much in favour of such initiatives and can confirm that it is the intention of the Commission to encourage such initiatives and to promote exchanges of experience and best practices. In fact the Commission is already giving support to such a project involving the inhabitants of the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, which covers part of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the follow-up of the Decker and Kohl judgments, there are important legal questions currently being debated in new cases before the Court. These questions concern hospital care and the Dutch health system. The Commission will await the outcome of these judgments before taking a position.</p>
<p class="contents">On obstacles to the mobility of stagiaires, students, volunteers and researchers, the Commission has already taken the initiative and presented a proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers. On 9 November 2000 the Education Council adopted its common position on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Parliament for its support on this matter and I hope that the final discussions will enable Parliament and the Council to adopt the recommendations shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the idea of a proposal for a directive on the introduction of frontier effect reports, whereby Member States would be required to test their legislation as to the effects for frontier workers, I should make it clear that it is already the Commission's task to ensure that all provisions of national legislation are compatible with the Treaty and the secondary legislation of Community law. The Commission will certainly continue to use the powers laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty and to launch infringement proceedings against Member States when they violate Community law. However, I understand that the suggested proposal for a directive aims to provide for a more general socio-economic impact assessment of the consequences of national legislation, that is in itself compatible with Community law but might cause further difficulties to frontier workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument. It seems to the Commission more appropriate to stimulate cross-border cooperation of the partners involved in the different regions and at Community level in order to prevent any negative consequences of national legislation on frontier workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my comments on tax. Unlike social security, there is no Community legislation at all on personal taxation. Indeed Member States are extremely protective of their sovereignty in this area. That is particularly true of their competence to enter into bilateral tax treaties. Therefore, there is little chance of the Commission being able to secure successfully the adoption of measures by Member States, as requested in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice. As you are aware, contrary to our common wishes, the requirement of unanimity in Council was retained for tax matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions are, moreover, likely to be divided about the merits of the recommendations made in the report concerning taxation in the State of employment. In fact, the prevailing view in tax administrations is that the State of residence rather than the State of employment is best placed to take account of the overall situation of taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten again for her stimulating report and to underline the Commission's determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
