<p class="contents">In 1997 an amendment to this Decision was presented which extended by two years the deadline for Member States to send their reports and the deadline for the Commission to draw up a progress report for Parliament and for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the common agricultural policy, the availability to everybody of reliable information for the purposes of decision making is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it must be a priority for the institutions to provide the means for this information to be ever more complete, reliable and quick, and therefore agricultural statistics must be ever more flexible, harmonious and coherent with other statistical fields with the possibility of incorporating new sources. To this end, we have to identify, firstly, the areas in which it is possible to implement rationalisation measures, secondly, areas where there are new and increasing needs, and thirdly, general principles in accordance with which actions are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it should not be necessary to point out that all the Member States should act in accordance with these intentions. However, this is not the case: this is a voluntary programme for the Member States. I would like to stress that it is not at all easy for this Parliament to understand that any Member State might say “I am not interested, I am not taking part”. The common agricultural policy belongs to all the Member States. It affects all of us. Therefore, I would like both the Commission and the Council to reconsider the matter and for the next proposal submitted to this Parliament to establish the obligatory nature of its application in all Member States, with a single legal basis in the statistical field.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect which I would like to point out to the Commission and the Council with regard to amendment 5, which I hope will be taken into account, given that the information requested in it, according to Regulation (EC) 1390/99, which entered into force on 23 November 1999, establishes in article 2 that “each Member State will provide the Commission with all the information classified by budgetary items which will be forwarded at the request of the Commission within 30 days”. Therefore, I request a specific commitment by the Commission that it will define each year, amongst the priority plans for technical action proposed to it by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, the things requested in our Amendments Nos 4 and 5, since otherwise, the codecision procedure would be delayed and it would become more difficult for the Member States to draw up their statistical reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to hear the Commission’s opinion with regard to this point in the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the things that I miss from the information we were given is the cost of this operation or what the cost would be if every Member State involved themselves in it. I do not suppose it is very big. Nevertheless the information is necessary for a Parliament discussing the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as the common agricultural policy develops from a situation in which we pay subsidies at the point of export or at the point of entry into intervention into a situation where we pay subsidies for individual animals on an acreage or the hectarage of crop planted, obviously it is extremely important that we know exactly how many animals there are in the Union, how many hectares and how many olive trees and all the rest of it. All that information is extremely important. It is extremely regrettable if we, at European level, the institutions who organise the common agricultural policy on which the farmers of the Union depend for their livelihood, cannot obtain correct information on which to base an effective policy. It is very hard to understand why we do not have better cooperation from all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When we expand the European Union, or even without expansion, we will not retain all the provisions of the present policy. Nevertheless, we will need this information so that we are able to extend some sort of assistance on a reasonable basis to the new countries of the Union where food production and agricultural production will increase by 50 per cent what we have in the Union today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also advisable to remember that in the Court of Auditors’ report, which has just come out and which was debated this week, we did not find in the whole agricultural sector any indication of massive racketeering or fraud on a large scale but we notice that there seem to be an awful lot of little problems with the number of livestock and the amount of hectarage for area aid and so on. There are small errors over a very wide area and that is a serious problem that we have to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that in the new Europe it is going to be important for farmers to base their levels of production on the projected quantities that will be produced in the Union. That cannot happen if we do not know the statistics of the agricultural industry. Increasingly, rather than screaming at the institutions of Union to solve the problems, farmers will have to come together and try to calculate what the needs of the market are and produce for those needs. That does not mean that we want to bring an end to subsidisation. For example, there is the pigmeat industry where we produce 18 million tons of pigmeat annually and we end up in a situation where there is a million tons in surplus. Prices collapse, there is terrible hardship and indeed terrible profiteering by middlemen. If we had good statistics, we would be able to deal with a problem like that before it arose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A viable system for statistics is an important basis for making good decisions. Statistics have to be comprehensive, reliable and consistent. The report quite clearly explains the legal basis of statistics, especially in Amendments Nos 2 and 3, which specify the Community’s share of the advance. Politically, the most important message is contained in Amendments Nos 4 and 5, which urges the practice of cross-tabulating subsidies received according to, inter alia, farm surface area. This information will be especially important when we consider the social side of agricultural subsidies. It would be difficult to support a subsidy scheme that channelled most of the aid to the large farms in the best agricultural regions. We have no data on this, but have to be content with the rumours that 80% of aid would go to 20% of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 emphasised the importance of statistics in connection with enlargement towards the east. This is a very important consideration that still means much work for the EU and the applicant countries. The problems over statistics for the applicant countries will not be resolved through this report. Problems have continued since the land register began to function. Embarking on eastward enlargement without any information on its effect on the budget would be political suicide. It does not help much, though, if our current data on expenditure is based on mistaken or unreliable data.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important aspect of statistical data on the European farmer is the reference yield. When Finland became a Member, as a result of poor yield in previous years, we had to be satisfied with a figure that did not reflect the truth in normal years. These reference yields should be raised to a realistic level as soon as possible, or we should start to reconsider the whole basis of their use and the idea of a drop in the price of grain as compensation for hectarage aid. We cannot undertake to subsidise producers in regions of highest yield in Europe for years and years on account of price reductions that have sometimes taken place in the past. The most obvious answer would be to harmonise hectarage aid as closely as possible within the whole territory of the EU. Mr President, the ELDR group supports this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European agriculture is not uniform. On the contrary, it is extremely diverse. It is therefore essential that statistics are accurate enough in terms of land, and compiled in a harmonised way, for us to be able to obtain judicious analyses by production type and by ecosystem. In 1996, the European Parliament adopted a report by Mr Jové Perez whose proposals aimed to make European statistics much more accurate and reliable. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission’s rather unambitious proposal that has been submitted to us has taken no account of it. This is why we shall support all of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as well as the one by Mr Jové Perez. Indeed, it seems essential to us that the wealth of information stemming from the implementation of the CAP aid should be made use of as a source of statistics. The cost to the Community budget would be almost nothing and statistical secrecy would be guaranteed through the data being incorporated. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the concern that led our group to table an amendment yesterday concerning the traceability of beef and veal because, as a result of the CAP aid, all animals in the European herd must be identified. This applies to abattoirs, too, for reasons of food and animal safety. I have not yet understood why the Commission has not accepted that, as of 1 January, these two facts, which have already been made compulsory across the Community, should be used to enable the operational start of traceability. It is quite inconsistent to postpone the establishment of compulsory labelling of beef and veal for another year and, at the same time, to condemn France’s application of the precautionary principle, precisely because there is no such compulsory labelling. </p>
<p class="contents">If the free movement of products is not accompanied by rigorous labelling, consumers will think it is a confidence trick. It is regrettable that Commissioner Byrne does not employ his zeal in the service of the health and the interest of European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, statistics often have different interpretations which can mean just what we want them to mean. If this is the case, then inconsistent statistics will only exacerbate the problem. This is why I also agree that statistics on the movement, policies and trade of agricultural products must be as consistent as possible. It would be ideal if each State did not, statistically at least, paint a different picture of our agricultural economy. Then, despite any diverse interpretations, we would at least have one true common version of the facts which would help those wishing to examine in closer detail what those statistics actually represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, therefore, that we should adopt the regulation, and I also agree with the comments on the amendments which have been made so that the Commission can see to it that the statistics paint as uniform and reliable a picture as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a sign of foresight, but it also shows that developments have been so rapid in recent years that standing still really means going backwards. This area can justly be described by the phrase ‘never finished, always on the way’. The European Union ought, as quickly as possible, to be in possession of common statistical material which is comprehensive in all areas. The Commission says that the Community’s agricultural statistics should continue to be adapted in the years 2000-2002. This means that we are talking here about extending these. If for a moment we look back to 1957 when the Treaty of Rome came into being, it was in fact the agricultural sphere which was the first big area upon which agreement was reached. Today – nearly 43 years later – no completely satisfactory statistics have been established for this area. The debate this week about the registration of animals showed very clearly that 12 out of 15 countries had not even begun preparations for this work. Things are naturally interconnected. Without registration, careful statistics cannot be kept and there are therefore, of course, opportunities for a series of errors regarding payments. </p>
<p class="contents">The Community makes contributions to offset the Member States’ expenditure in connection with implementing the relevant arrangements. It is therefore necessary that the Commission should now do some tightening up. It cannot be the slowest countries which are to set the pace. The Commission ought to set the agenda to a much greater degree and lead the Member States in accordance with the common resolutions. How can we envisage re-establishing consumer confidence in food following all the scandals when the EU cannot even implement its own resolutions? Food safety, risk assessment and the very concept of safety are such important areas that there is no avoiding them nowadays. Allow me, therefore, quietly to ask: when are we to put our own house in order? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there is no reason to hesitate. The future belongs to those who prepare themselves for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am able to inform you that the Council has obviously adopted our demand to introduce this system by 1.9. This represents a small victory for the European Parliament as far as the timeframe is concerned. However, it did not reach this decision under the codecision procedure. This would have meant it also having to adopt all the other proposed amendments that we voted on here yesterday in the simplified procedure. Then all our proposed amendments would have been adopted in the codecision procedure. Instead of which, the Council decided, under the old regulation 820/97, in accordance with Article 19 of the implementing rules, that the Member States now have the facility to continue with the voluntary system until 1.9.2000. I do not consider this to be the right strategy either. It does, however, go some way towards meeting European Parliament requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, we are now going to continue with the codecision procedure for the other proposed amendments, which we voted on yesterday, for this process will run on after 1.1.2000. The Council must give its reaction to this. If it fails to adopt our proposed amendments then we will become involved in a conciliation procedure. All the other matters that we want to include in this regulation will therefore still be a matter for debate. I hope that we will be able to persuade the Council to adopt our proposals in this area too, and that it allows reason to prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It foresees adoption according to the codecision procedure. The proposal submitted today for your approval is the first example insofar as agricultural statistics are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for her excellent work and, in particular, for her cooperation with the Council and the Commission on this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased about the global support expressed in the report for the draft Council and Parliament decision. The background is Council Decision 96/411(EC) on improving Community agricultural statistics. It has put at the Commission's disposal a flexible tool which allows it to adapt statistical applications to changes in information needs. This has helped to adapt the system of Community agricultural statistics to changes in the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the European Parliament and the Council the Commission has presented an overview of the actions undertaken during the period 1996-1999 in different areas. The overall assessment of these actions by the Commission is positive. However, the process of adapting national statistical systems to the needs arising from the reform of the common agricultural policy has not yet been completed. The Commission has therefore proposed to extend for a further three years, with some minor changes, the validity of Decision 96/411(EC). The changes are mainly aimed at either simplifying the implementation of this action programme or at reducing the delay for paying the Community contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that this new decision enters into force as soon as possible in order to avoid a vacuum in the present legislation. An effort should be made to adopt this proposal after first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns Mrs Redondo Jiménez's report, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendment No 4, even in its new, modified version. This amendment would still imply some new obligations for Member States which have not yet been discussed in the Council. This would certainly prevent the adoption of the proposal in the Council at first reading. Nevertheless, the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that the additional information requested by this amendment would indeed be useful in order to have a better idea of the distribution of aid paid in the context of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore commit itself to include such actions in the next technical programmes, starting from 2001, in view of encouraging progress in this area. We hope that this may reassure the European Parliament about our intentions and may lead Mrs Redondo Jiménez to withdraw this amendment in order to allow the proposal to be adopted at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
