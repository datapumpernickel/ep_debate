You will remember that at that time, after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, uniform rules on visas were to be introduced within the European Union for the first time. This meant that people from third countries entering the European Union were in principle to be subject to the same visa requirements in all countries in the European Union. At the time the Commission had already made a proposal which on the whole was very good and which also received support in Parliament. Unfortunately the Council then made fundamental changes to this proposal and more or less declared the entire visa list to be as good as non-binding when it said that anyone could go beyond it and either impose visa requirements on additional states or leave it at that; they simply had to notify this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time the European Parliament considered that its views had not been properly taken into account and, moreover, that this result was also contrary to what the Maastricht Treaty actually intended. We then instituted legal action. We won the case before the European Court of Justice. The Council regulation concerned was declared null and void. The result was that the Commission made a new proposal to us which was very similar to its first proposal, to which we again gave an essentially positive assessment in Parliament, and which then, because of the change of legal base – Maastricht gave way to Amsterdam – had to be recast in a new proposal, which is now on the table here and which we must once again debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament continues to believe that the visa list in this visa regulation must be definitive, which means that there must be no more exceptions to it, so no black, green, blue, yellow or grey lists, but please just one list, one list which is binding and no other. This is a crucial point if we are finally to have uniform rules on visas in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has given ground on one important point, which Parliament regarded as essential even last time round. It concerns the visa requirements for two associated countries, which are now of course already a long way into the accession process, namely Bulgaria and Romania. Parliament has always been of the opinion that these states should be exempt from visa requirements. We came to this conclusion on the basis that much progress has been made in these countries on internal security and many other issues. The Commission has now also accepted this and is proposing to include Bulgaria and Romania in the list of states which are exempt from visa requirements. We see this as a step forward. Obviously these countries have in the meantime also managed to convince the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we can only hope that, if possible, after listening to the European Parliament, the Council makes the same decision and also recognises that important progress has been made here. My plea to the Council would be that it should debate this regulation as soon as possible. I should like once again to extend my warmest thanks to the plenary, but also this time to the Conference of Presidents, which put this report on today's agenda even though it had not originally planned to do so, precisely because this makes it possible to complete our business quickly and send out an appropriate signal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to this debate a whole series of requests for amendments, which it was hoped we would adopt here, were sent to me from the Council. For example, there was a proposal to introduce so-called reciprocity. What is this? Quite simply, citizens from individual Member States are subject to visa requirements in some third countries. These Member States should, it is argued, have the possibility of demanding visas from citizens from these same third countries. I rejected this. Not because I do not have sympathy for these Member States' demands, but because I believe that in introducing this we would again be contravening the overall principle and we would again be in breach of the provisions of the Treaty, which provides precisely for a standard visa list comprising a list of countries which are subject to visa requirements and a list of those which are not. For this reason I do not believe that we can introduce a provision of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we have come so far – I only need to mention the implementation of Schengen, meaning that there are no longer any controls at the vast majority of borders – that nothing else is simply good enough anymore. We need standard rules on visas, and I think that the Commission has tabled a good proposal. We have also debated it in Parliament accordingly, I hope, as the Commission had in mind. Now it is the Council's turn. As soon as possible it ought to produce a result which is as constructive as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to one or two points from it. I hope that most Members in this House will agree with me that we should be moving towards a visa-free Europe, a Europe without barriers, at ease with itself and the rest of the world. I know we still have some stumbling blocks and Europe and the world are not quite ready for that at the moment. But the rapporteur has spoken about no exceptions and I am delighted to support him in that we have one single list.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to draw attention to a few amendments. Amendment No. 2 is important. It says it is essential that we have procedures that are as smooth and as simple as possible and do not cause unreasonable expenditure for the applicants. Many of us in this House know as well as anyone that getting a visa can be a time-consuming and expensive business. We want to make certain in Europe that is not the case working in the opposite direction. Similarly, Amendment No 6 speaks about young people and encouraging them to take part in youth programmes by not giving them the extra burden of visas. That is important because young people are enthusiastic about the European ideal and we do not want to put anything in their way that makes them think that Europe is not welcoming and not moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns Romania and Bulgaria, particularly Romania, a country I know well. Every time I go there I have to go through the procedure of getting a visa and the Romanians say that as long as the European Union wants visas from them they will demand them from us. So we are taking a step in the right direction and I am happy to support the amendments and the report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lehne's report gives important momentum to this process and we support his report. He is already aware of this, so I do not need to thank him yet again because I have already done so in private.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter I should like to address here, something which I have reflected on many times, because I am of Turkish origin, is the following. We considered whether we should table any amendments, but in fact we decided not to do so. We will not therefore be making any recommendations here on how the report should be dealt with. However, I should like to take the opportunity today – because otherwise no one listens to me – to voice my opinion for once on something which I am very uneasy about. In my opinion, it cannot be right for the European Union to offer Turkey a chance to accede while at the same time maintaining the entry restrictions. I am surprised that we cannot manage to find an alternative way to deal with the Turkey issue, particularly within the context of this harmonised list. I am aware of the reasons for this, but I should nevertheless like to use our Parliament as a platform.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 3 million people of Turkish origin live in Europe and it is for this very reason that our Commissioner ought perhaps to consider in the future how we are going to resolve this problem reasonably and humanely in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That architecture rests on two cornerstones, namely the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in accordance with the new Title IV inserted in the European Community Treaty, and the integration of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the Union framework, to which is added the dimension of variable geometry resulting from the different protocols annexed by several Member States to the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal has a legal basis taken from the Amsterdam Treaty, and its content and wording take account of the institutional constraints that I have just mentioned. The Commission has carefully examined the report by Mr Lehne, whom I would like to congratulate. In the past, as rapporteur, Mr Lehne has already had the opportunity to show his interest, expertise and commitment in this subject that he has just presented. The Commission is pleased to note that the report adopted by the Committee of Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs broadly supports the Commission's proposal. But this is hardly surprising since, as Mr Lehne himself pointed out, the proposal meets a number of requests that the European Parliament itself put forward in various resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments to its proposal, the Commission appreciates very much the Parliament's constructive contribution. To clarify our position: Amendments Nos 3 and 4 can be accepted, as the changes they make to the wording avoid any contradiction with other provisions of the regulation. We can also accept Amendments Nos 1 and 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are prompted by a wish to clarify the demarcation line between the scope of the regulation and other matters, some of which are governed by the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, integrated into the Community. The Commission is sensitive to the desire for clarification which it furthermore took into account in its explanatory memorandum. It takes the view, however, that the appropriate place for such clarification is not in an article of the regulation, and it is prepared to draft a new recital based on the gist of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 in our opinion cannot be accepted since it relates to the conditions for the issue of visas, which do not fall within the scope of this regulation but will have to be addressed in a different instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 6. Despite all the sympathy that can be felt towards the possibility of exempting young people taking part in European Union Youth Programmes from visa requirements, the Commission must stick to its aim of maximum harmonisation and avoid cases creating derogations from, or exceptions to, the visa requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that efforts to ensure that the need to obtain a visa does not constitute an obstacle to young people wishing to take part in European Union programmes will have to be made in the rules on the conditions for the issue of visas which will be dealt with by a different instrument and which are not covered by this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to thank the Parliament, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and Mr Lehne, the rapporteur, for their constructive approach and also, especially, for having examined the Commission's proposal on visas so swiftly. Parliament's swiftness is appreciated by the Commission, and it will help it, in the field of visas, to meet the deadlines set in the action plan adopted in Vienna and reproduced in the scoreboard drawn up following the European Council in Tampere.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
