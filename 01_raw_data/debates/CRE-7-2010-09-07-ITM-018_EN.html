I am not talking about legislation here, but an exchange of best practice between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For too long, the treatment of older people has been inadequate in many areas. We need to know, first and foremost, what data the Commission already has on the provision of care in Member States. Does the Commission see itself playing a role in the dissemination of best practice?</p>
<p class="contents">A key area I have been concerned with for a number of years is elder abuse. It can take many forms – physical, mental, emotional and financial. Take the case of a 93-year-old woman who went into a care home for respite care for one week, one week only, only for her to return home completely dehydrated; obviously, no attempt had been made to help her to drink at all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an isolated case. There are many cases of malnutrition and dehydration, but it would be useful if we could have facts and figures. Has the Commission got any data on the number of deaths attributable to dehydration or malnutrition?</p>
<p class="contents">Just as worrying, of course, is the more frequent use of Do Not Resuscitate orders. It should be up to the medical practitioner, in consultation with the patient, to decide on whether DNR should be on someone’s notes. I know of cases where either the nursing home itself decides which person is to be resuscitated or not, or the relatives are told that they must sign up to the document, which is a complete abuse of the person’s right to choose.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission doing to look at the use of so-called Do Not Resuscitate orders? I am not talking about living wills here, I am talking about Do Not Resuscitate orders. Does the Commission agree that it violates the right to life under Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights?</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the World Health Organisation has adopted a broad definition of elder abuse. We need now at EU level to clarify the extent of that abuse. I hope that the Commission will bring forward a Green Paper on elder abuse; I know that the Commissioner has talked about that himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Over-prescription of medication, particularly anti-psychotic drugs, is also abuse. Quite often, they are used for the benefit of the staff, not for the resident in a care home. Also, conversely, older people are denied medical treatment on the grounds of age alone. This is another reason why I believe pressure should be put on the Council for a decision on the equal treatment directive to outlaw discrimination in access to goods and services, and that would include healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">More must be done as well by each Member State to make sure that older people can be supported in their own homes if that is what they wish, and to regulate qualification requirements for people caring for older people, with adequate training mechanisms in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States have cut back on specialist geriatric medicine and we need to know what the real effects have been on older people. We must not forget, either, the support and recognition that informal carers need. Quite often, they are the ones who care for their relatives day in, day out, with little help.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole area of long-term care for older people has been ignored for many years. I hope, with this oral question and resolution, that all of us together can start to really give this matter the attention it deserves. Quite often, older people who require long-term care find it very difficult to speak for themselves. It is up to us all, working with them, to make sure their voices are heard and not forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is the goal the Member States set themselves in the objectives they agreed for healthcare and long-term care at EU level. In addition, the Council conclusions of 30 November 2009 called on the Commission to develop ‘an action plan for further activities in 2011, which will promote dignity, health and quality of life for older persons’. I am pleased that the forthcoming presidencies, including the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies, intend to take this work forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives to step up work on the quality of long-term care services, increase knowledge in this area and promote debate at EU level. It has long supported work on long-term care provision as part of the open method of coordination in the area of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2009 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion confirmed the importance of addressing the issue of workforce shortages in the long-term care sector. Identifying and disseminating best practice is one of our main objectives. The Commission can act as a catalyst for change and can support national efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">A Commission staff working paper is currently being prepared on long-term care in connection with efforts to promote active, healthy and dignified ageing, and a Commission communication is scheduled for 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the Commission adopted the proposal for designating 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing. The Year will serve as a framework for raising awareness, identifying and disseminating good practice and, more importantly, encouraging policy makers and stakeholders at all levels to facilitate active ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to invite these players to commit themselves to specific actions and goals in 2011, the run-up year, so that tangible achievements can be presented during the European Year in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I want now to talk about people more concretely. You have rightly pointed out that, in most Member States, the bulk of support and care for dependent persons is provided by family and friends, and this will continue to apply over the next few decades. In all countries, women are far more likely to be carers than men. Inadequate recognition of the role of informal carers and inadequate support for their contribution can lead to risks of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">To help remedy this situation, the Member States, together with the EU institutions, could consider moves to assess and certify caring skills, including those acquired while caring for dependent relatives, and in household management, which are activities mainly performed by women.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress will depend on efforts by many stakeholders. The Commission warmly welcomes the work on care issues carried out by Parliament’s Interest Groups on Ageing and on Carers and by civil society organisations such as AGE and Eurocarers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not planning to set up an Active Ageing Observatory, but mutual learning covering active ageing is one of the aims of the European Year for Active Ageing, for which a dedicated web site will be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to mention the contributions of the Grundtvig programme for adult education, the public health programme and the 2011 European Year of Volunteering.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne, you rightly underlined the importance of ethical issues such as those involved in ‘do not resuscitate’ orders. While the Commission acknowledges the importance of this issue – and I fully share the moral substance of your question – we sometimes have to express ourselves in legalistic terms, and if we do that in this case, we must say that such matters are exclusively a Member State competence and that we do not have the capacity, from the viewpoint of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to interfere with that Member State competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken a number of initiatives – including the major conference it held on 17 March 2008 – to increase knowledge of the elder abuse issue and to promote debate at EU level on how to prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, the Commission implemented a pilot project which led to the selection of two projects. One project investigates how elder abuse can be monitored through public health and long-term care systems. The second seeks to map existing policy approaches and policy frameworks in the European Union. Both projects started in December 2009 and the findings will be presented in autumn next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also continues to cofinance a number of actions under the Daphne programme and the public health programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively supporting work under way within the Social Protection Committee on a voluntary quality framework for social services. That framework needs to be flexible enough to apply in all the Member States at national, regional and local level and to a variety of social services.</p>
<p class="contents">One big sector where the framework could apply is long-term care. But delivering long-term care is not an easy task on a daily basis, and it is the sad truth that people with heavy care responsibilities often have to give up, or reduce, their hours of paid work because of these commitments. In turn, this affects their attractiveness on the labour market, their current income and their future pension rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our longstanding work with the Member States on reconciling family and working life has revealed the importance of adjusting the working conditions of persons who provide informal care.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing social services that allow for respite care and care leave, and granting specific rights to informal carers in social security schemes, in particular, as regards pension entitlement, would also help to encourage and enable more people to provide informal care.</p>
<p class="contents">As you suggest, poverty, access to care and longevity may be interlinked. We looked at such links in a recent communication on health inequalities. The evidence clearly confirms that differences in income, working and living conditions are reflected in the average health status at all ages.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are only at the beginning in terms of policies that effectively break or modify the links between the social hierarchy and the hierarchy of health statuses.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are calling for is therefore more awareness and research, and more innovative policy development. In addition, we need to promote a ‘health in all policies’ approach which is a vital component of any successful strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must place an ever greater emphasis on care for the increasing number of elderly people. The traditions and culture of elder care differ by region: in the southern Member States, multiple generations living together solve the problem within the family, while in the northern Member States, institutionalised care is more common.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the costs of the latter form of care are growing and sustainability is increasingly tested due to the economic situation and the growth seen in the ageing population. In Central and Eastern Europe, non-governmental organisations and churches are very often able to implement a certain type of institutionalised procedure efficiently. However, this is still a rare phenomenon, and the state does not support this development route for the elder care system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, the training system established for immigrants successfully solved the employment problem of previously unemployed women through elder care. Obviously, this practice can also be adopted successfully in other Member States. I welcome fellow Members Berès’s and Lynne’s motion for a resolution. I would like to highlight the part of the text calling on the Commission to compile a Green Paper based on Member States’ best practices and models, so that each Member State is empowered to implement the most adequate measures within its means, excluding the possibility of mistreatment and abuse of the elderly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we can indeed be proud that life expectancy is on the rise in Europe, it is also a challenge. It is a challenge partly because we do not know how we can ensure the opportunity for active ageing in an ageing society. It is also unknown to what extent we can ensure the opportunity for active participation in society and non-discriminatory treatment for the elderly. We are aware that there is a lot to do in this area. Can we achieve an increase in the number of healthy years? To what extent can we provide income security for the elderly or lifelong learning?</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe that certain European Year which will be called the European Year for Active Ageing will help draw more attention to this issue. However, it is inevitable that there will be a period when elderly people will be in need of social and health services and will have less power to represent themselves, thus increasing our responsibility to ensure that they have access to quality services. It is particularly important that appropriate services are available for low income, poor elderly people and for elderly people requiring permanent nursing and care, regardless of whether they need home nursing or are looked after in institutions. There are also a few specific tasks with which we are requesting the Commission’s assistance. First, we need some vital data on what the needs are and on those who require care. Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable, we need monitoring mechanisms, and the compilation of best practices is also part of the minimum standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I found quite a lot of it quite encouraging in some ways.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have recognised, of course, that a number of our questions concern the issues about the vulnerability of older people and a very strong feeling that we have that it is crucially important that people can feel safe with those providing care.</p>
<p class="contents">While I take your point about the issues about what is a Member State competence, nevertheless, the open method of coordination exists to help Member States work together on something which, while it is not a competence of the European Union, nevertheless is seen as something of common importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think certain of the issues, even about basic care, nutrition, etc., are very important within this. I am also wondering what further steps the Commission might take to persuade Member States of the cost-effectiveness of supporting informal carers. There are certainly figures from the UK that recognise that this is a contribution of billions saved in our economy, because the care is being given by close friends or relatives rather than by the state, and that in fact, investing in something like a carer’s allowance and support mechanisms for carers really is worth doing, rather than having people totally worn out, isolated and suffering their own health and mental health problems because they have been caring for hours without background support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also interested in what you are saying about the possibilities of improving the qualifications of carers. Part of that issue, of course, is not only that this concerns women, it often concerns migrant women, and therefore a particular sort of investment is needed. But our resolution also talks about the need for contracts to stipulate at least a minimum income, a minimum wage. I would welcome your comments on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My great-grandmother is 69 years old and I have lived a long time with her. This is why I know from experience that the best way for us to care for the elderly is by ensuring that they can look after themselves as far as possible. However, even those who are in good mental and physical shape for their age face a strenuous task. The Attack party raised this issue during the previous parliamentary term and will also do so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The average pension in Bulgaria is a mere EUR 100. That is EUR 100 a month, fellow Members. Pensioners have to use this money to buy their medication, pay their bills and, usually last of all, provide their food. The reason for this state of affairs is the huge act of robbery committed against my country by the last three governments in succession. This robbery goes by the name of ‘mass privatisation’. I must also mention that it was carried out under the approving eye of the European institutions and the International Monetary Fund. Assets worth billions of euro were stolen from Bulgaria, which does not make it strange that my country has the lowest pensions in the European Union. This tragic situation must serve as an example to you when you are wondering how we are to care for the elderly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, it has complied with a request from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the report on intergenerational equity. Congratulations! This important message is coming at just the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of people over 80 years of age who are healthy and capable is constantly rising. For the period from 2010 to 2030, an increase of almost 60% is forecast. In the question put by our Committee, we call on the Commission to analyse the positive, but also the negative, effects in the area of care for the elderly and to propose conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that more and more families cannot cope with the care of their relatives alone. Care workers are in short supply. However, it is not good enough for well-trained and competent staff to be replaced by low-paid employees with basic knowledge obtained in a fast-tracked process. In many places, this care is the only care received.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for demographic change and intergenerational equity, I have called on the Member States to set up transparent and sustainable control systems. Those in need of care must have their dignity protected. We need an EU-wide Code of Conduct containing minimum requirements and minimum outcomes of services for the provision of long-term care. Regardless of income, age, social status or health risk, people must receive affordable, good quality care.</p>
<p class="contents">Elderly people are not a burden, either. Their experiences and their life achievements have shaped our society. We must not leave them alone to face their problems. Let us use the time leading up to 2012 to create many prerequisites to allow politics, the media and the public to engage intensively with the issue of active ageing. In this regard, those affected must, above all, have their say. We must all change our attitude in favour of a sustainable form of care that is continuously focused on people and not just on costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, intergenerational solidarity is mentioned in just one – the second from last. In order for the problem to be fully understood, I would like to add some more questions.</p>
<p class="contents">A moment ago, we were talking about how the European Commission can influence the Member States. Why does the European Commission not suggest to the Member States that they should value the care provided by family members to older, incapacitated people? Why, if a family member is looking after a relative, is that family member not financially rewarded and provided with health and social security cover and able to return to the workplace when the period of care comes to an end, just like a woman after maternity leave? Why are men and women who display intergenerational solidarity discriminated against in our society?</p>
<p class="contents">If we tried to eliminate this discrimination within the Union, we would have a far larger number of happier and more satisfied inhabitants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Ms Lynne for outlining in particular the problems that exist in this so-called civilised society in the abuse of the elderly. The Commission has also given a very rounded contribution, outlining the goals, the challenges and the solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think we should look at this as an opportunity, an opportunity to allow people to work beyond the normal time and age as of now, and secondly, particularly to travel and to contribute to tourism in the off-season. Then, of course, we have the challenge of caring for people in their homes for as long as possible, and then in institutionalised care. But the financial provisions have not been factored in at all yet, and a huge amount of work must be done if we are to reach a situation where the elderly are cared for properly in the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have 27 Member States with different social conditions and material conditions and this is the main reason why the Commission is now working on a quality framework, not something stronger in terms of legislation. We believe this is now the right concept and we should see how it works together with Parliament, with which we have discussed these issues repeatedly in the recent period.</p>
<p class="contents">One key point where I think we can draw strong conclusions is how long-term care connects with our jobs agenda, how we see a strong capacity for job creation, but it also sets us the task of including this into our skills agenda and finding out how we can do more to train and develop a larger pool of carers who can provide professional services in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed an open question how far we have to formalise these services because, as has been said, much of the work that is being done is informal. It is done, or can be done, by relatives and within families. Regulating issues, raising standards or demanding certain conditions within the framework of families and relatives is clearly something which would be highly problematic. Meanwhile, formalising these services and this work would add to costs and raise taxation issues, and we would easily find ourselves in a dead end in a different direction.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is no easy answer, while there are indeed compelling grounds to improve the conditions of those who need these services and are dependent on long-term care, but also to recognise those who provide this work. What we certainly can do is collect and disseminate best practices, for example, by using the open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say, at this late hour, that in a few hours’ time, I will meet some ministers from the Belgian Government in Liège at a conference on pensions. This will be a good opportunity to convey the words of Parliament on this question and connect it with our work on pensions, because these subjects are clearly interlinked in terms of both social security in general and an adequate income for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a longer-term plan to follow up our work on pensions with a serious effort on demography. The forthcoming Hungarian and Polish Presidencies are equally interested in this subject, and we are exploring the right framework for the deliverables involved. This work will be followed by the European Year on Active Ageing, which is not only about employment – and definitely not simply about extending the pensionable age – but is also about doing more to preserve health and to upgrade lifelong learning, lifelong teaching, capacities and institutions in order to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is fundamentally a framework in which we can, I think, continue our work. It is full of challenges, but with the ethical commitment we all share, I think we can produce results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These have been very useful. What has come out of this discussion also is the importance of having a code of conduct. This is something I called for in the oral question and resolution, and to which Thomas Mann and various other people have referred.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, we are not talking about legislation. The good example from Bulgaria of someone living on EUR 100 a month and having to pay for long-term care is just one of the reasons why we need that code of conduct, so that Member States can meet a minimum standard.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to ‘do not resuscitate’ orders. I am not saying that the same sort of legislation should be rolled out across all the Member States, but that we should actually have benchmarks for people to try and achieve best practice. That is where the Commission can do a lot of work in helping us to roll out the good practices acquired from different Member States.</p>
