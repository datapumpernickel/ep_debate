It is something we all tend to agree on. However, in order for the consumer to achieve that, we need to provide the consumer with accurate, exact, correct, scientifically justified information. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that in Europe the consumer assumes and expects that any label that reaches him or her has been checked and approved by an authority. Therefore, there is a responsibility here to do so. I would also like to remind you of something I mentioned earlier, that any vacuum that may be left in Community legislation will be filled in by the Member States and therefore will defeat the purpose of having this harmonised legislation and will mean a return to a fragmented set of rules and regulations that harm the industry, consumer confidence, cause problems for the internal market and of course do not achieve the level of protection that we would all like to have.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we presented this proposal. I would like to thank the committee for all the work it has done on such an important issue, the rapporteur, Mrs Poli Bortone and of course the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank Mrs Niebler and Mr Stubb, the draftsmen of the opinions of the two other committees, and the committees themselves, for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal says something very simple. It says that no one can make a voluntary claim without having the scientific justification for doing so. We must not forget that these are voluntary claims with the sole aim of profit, it is a marketing tool. Therefore, in order to allow the use of this marketing tool for profit, we must make sure that it has the correct scientific justification and that it is substantiated scientifically. Consumers, as I said earlier, have to be able to make their own decisions, but they must not be misled. They must not be convinced by products sold on unsubstantiated claims.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the proposal meets the purposes I would like it to. It protects the consumer; it advances health considerations; it helps the industry, competition and the internal market and it allows innovation. Having a common set of rules in a unique legal environment also helps in the internal market and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Some claims that may have adverse effects will need to remain prohibited. It is also very important to maintain the link between claims and nutritional profiles. Once again I have to remind you that these are voluntary claims and if they are going to be made, they have to based on a nutritional balance. If the nutritional balance is questionable then the use as a marketing tool of a specific characteristic of a foodstuff must not be allowed as it will eventually mislead the consumer. The nutritional profile is a key element of the proposal and therefore it should remain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Adriana Poli Bortone (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on nutrition and health claims has arisen from the possibility of building on the consumer’s growing interest in receiving clear information on the nutritional and health value of foods, and from the need for the food industry to respond to this urgent request with clear, accurate and significant information, which is substantiated scientifically. All of this should take place within a framework of harmonised market regulations, in order to enable food business operators to be competitive according to fair and equitable regulatory criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Healthy food and good health go hand in hand as benchmarks for the behaviour of consumers, who have a much greater awareness of their diet these days and who are increasingly concerned to know what they are eating and to understand how food products impact on their health.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the behaviour of the average consumer, and the food industry has attempted to respond to this behaviour by means of more detailed nutritional labelling, providing claims on the positive benefits, or alleged benefits, of some foods.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that the two basic EU directives in force – Directives 2000/13 and 90/496, relating to the labelling and nutrition labelling of foodstuffs respectively – are not only inadequately enforced in the majority of cases, but they also respond poorly to the present<span class="bold">–</span>day demands of consumers, since they do not allow any data to be given on the alleged health benefits, and they do not clearly define the conditions of use of the nutrition claims.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of specific provisions at European level has given rise, moreover, to a real proliferation of claims on the labels of food products – claims varying in number and type. The Member States have adopted independent provisions and standards to regulate the use of the various claims. This results in a regulatory mess, with different approaches to the same subject<span class="bold">–</span>matter, which has given rise to a state of confusion that leads to neither the effective running of the internal market, nor the safeguarding of public health and consumer health.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with such legal uncertainty, there is a need to harmonise the regulations relating to foodstuffs at Community level and, therefore, a need for a regulation which, without banning any foods, will clearly set out the fundamental conditions to ensure that the claims on foodstuffs are completely accurate for consumers. That is one further step forwards in implementing the nutrition policy included in the objectives proposed by the Commission in 1999 with the White Paper on food safety. In this White Paper it is expressly stated that the Union’s food policy should be built around strict food safety standards that protect and promote the health of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">To these objectives must be added that of increasing the free movement of food products, in that the creation of a regulation will enable food business operators to be competitive on a fair and equal footing throughout the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With the document that we are studying, the Commission has proposed the introduction of a new regulatory framework for nutrition and health claims, authorising the use of nutrition claims provided that they comply with the provisions set out in the annex,<span class="bold"> </span>which contains a list of nutrition claims and specific conditions for the use thereof:<span class="bold"> </span>the use of health claims will be subject to an authorisation or notification procedure (if the Commission’s text were to remain unchanged).</p>
<p class="contents">Through the procedures laid down by Article 93(2), the Commission proposes to draw up specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods within a period of 18 months, which could rise to as much as 30 months, and, subject to consultation of the Food Safety Agency, specific nutrient profiles for foods or categories of foods, and the adoption of a Community list of health claims which describe the generally accepted role of a nutrient or other substances on the basis of proposals submitted by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In setting the nutrient profiles, the Commission will consult both food business operators and consumer groups, in addition to the Agency, which will see its role strengthened as a result of its involvement in the various stages and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be acknowledged, at this stage, that the two years that have passed since the presentation have not been in vain, since all the interested parties – the Commission itself, the Council, Parliament, industry, consumers and the Economic and Social Committee – have recorded significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made many amendments to the Commission’s text, however, in particular by removing Article 4, which, in my opinion, is an extremely important article because it sets out the nutrient profiles. The coherence and complexity of the regulation would, moreover, be of truly little significance if this article were not reintroduced. It is an article that I hope my fellow Members will wish to reintroduce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is this regulation about? It is about regulating food advertising. The Commission’s view is that everything should be regulated: nutrition claims (such as fat content, high energy, low energy); health claims (such as ‘a food strengthens the body’s defences’, ‘a food helps concentration’, and so on) and pure ‘feel<span class="bold">–</span>good’ claims (such as ‘a food keeps you fit, gives you a boost, gives you energy’, and so on). ‘Feel<span class="bold">–</span>good’ claims are to be banned completely and health claims will in future have to be authorised by the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">How this proposal for a regulation is supposed to be compatible with the Lisbon strategy, heaven knows. Neither is there any justification for these provisions, with the exception of those harmonising nutrition claims.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of the discussions in the various different committees we have heard people say time and again that we in Europe have to do something to combat widespread child obesity. That is of course true, but we will not achieve this by banning advertising claims! If people want to take action against child obesity, they need to see to it that eating habits are changed, that our children do more sport and that they spend less time in front of the television and the computer.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, why should mood and fitness<span class="bold">–</span>related claims be banned, when they express an individual feeling and are easily recognisable as advertising? I believe that the approach that the Commission has adopted here is wrong. What we have here is the philosophy of ‘Everything is banned unless it is allowed’, and the Commissioner argued for it when he said that consumers expect every label to have first been checked by the authority. If you will forgive my saying so, this is not only about labels: it is about advertising claims.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that this is a good approach, and I am grateful that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has also given it as its opinion that Articles 4 and 11, in particular, should be deleted. I hope that we will also achieve this result at tomorrow’s vote: the modification of Article 11 and the deletion of Article 4. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have three points. First, I will tell the Commission right off the bat that I am a federalist, but what the Commission is proposing here is simply going too far. It is over<span class="bold">– </span>regulation. I wish to focus especially on Article 4, which is one of the most illiberal proposals to pass through this House. It is not our job to tell the consumer what is good or what is bad. That is up to the consumer himself or herself to decide. I have quite a lot of faith in the individual to be able to make his or her own decisions on what food should or should not be eaten. The key is to know the content and then you can make your own choice. If we put in nutrient profiles, it might prevent the consumers from getting the right information.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I believe diets themselves are more important than the nutrient profiles of individual foods. Different people have different dietary needs, just as Mrs Niebler told us earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that it is very important to have clear labels and better information. However, I cannot support needless legislation or the assumption that people do not understand what is said on the label. Therefore, I would argue very strongly that we should remove Article 4 from the original Commission proposal and we adopt Article 11 along the lines that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In tabling it, the Commission is clearly going beyond its competences. It is not pursuing consumer protection, but is trying to nanny and gag consumers, for it sees the citizens of Europe as stupid, fat and gluttonous, and so nutrient profiles are to be used to divide foods into good and bad products, and this in accordance with a procedure that is scientifically untenable. Above all, this is to be done on the quite simply erroneous premise that advertising alone is to blame for Europeans’ expanding waistlines. Let me tell the Commission that this bears no relation to the real world! I wonder more and more frequently which planet you come from. Advertising that is not expressly permitted is then to be banned in the future. Of course advertisements must not lie! No one wants that. But we do not need advertising censorship. After all, we already have a law that protects consumers from misleading advertising. And of course advertising is the elixir of life for the food sector in this overcrowded food market. Innovation in this sector is only possible if one product can distinguish itself from another. Only in this way can it be successfully promoted and marketed. And innovation is ultimately also of benefit to consumers, who consequently have access to better and better products.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation is key to a company’s success and thus secures jobs. Do you have any idea how many jobs a law like this would destroy? You are creating a bureaucratic monster: a laborious and lengthy authorisation procedure for every single advertising slogan from 25 Member States, obviously to be submitted translated word for word into all 20 official languages!</p>
<p class="contents">This would deal the last deathblow to our SMEs. But they would of course already be overstretched by the ongoing need to provide up<span class="bold">–</span>to<span class="bold">–</span>date scientific proof. Why should people no longer be allowed to say, ‘Fruit is healthy’? Because there may be a type of fruit that is too sweet for the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">We are making ourselves a laughing stock. This is the kind of thing that fosters political apathy and euro<span class="bold">–</span>scepticism. I urge you, Commissioner, to withdraw this proposal for good. I would have said this to you earlier, but you do not seem so keen to talk to us troublesome parliamentarians. Perhaps you should have come down from the glass tower of the Berlaymont building into the depths of our offices and attended a meeting of our committee. Then you would know that we will also be mobilising all of our resources tomorrow in the plenary to put a stop to this nonsense of the nutrient profiles in Article 4 and several other things besides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dorette Corbey, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many consumers are worried about their health, cholesterol, blood pressure or have a weight problem. The food industry takes advantage of this. There is a proliferation of all kinds of claims. This morning, I had a sandwich that is good for my intestinal flora, the butter in which reduces my cholesterol level; I also had an egg that is high in Omega 3. This afternoon, I had a low<span class="bold">-</span>calorie drink. I, at any rate, think this is terrific, for I have no knowledge of these things.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important that this legislative proposal should require scientific proof for the claims made by the food manufacturers. We must prevent the consumer from being misled. Consumers are often prepared to pay more for a product that claims to benefit their health, but they should then be able to rely on that. Deception comes in many forms.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with Article 4, health claims can only be made about products that meet a certain profile. That is right, for you cannot turn greasy croquet potatoes into a healthy food by adding a few vitamins. Yoghurt with 0% fat is not good for the figure if a good measure of sugar has been added. A lollipop that is high in sugar is not a healthy snack even if it also contains Vitamin A. That is why Article 4 is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot identify with the argument by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that SMEs struggle with Article 4. Even a small food company must know what ingredients they use in bread or snacks. My group is behind the consumers and supports well<span class="bold">–</span>intentioned companies. I hope that a majority in this House will take this line and will not repeal Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, the request for a study made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is equally beyond me. It is clear that it is not easy to draft those profiles, but it is equally clear that in the United States and in some companies, nutrient profiles have been used for a long time. I would therefore urge the Liberals not to ask for studies every turn around, but to take a decision and not to leave the consumers out in the cold.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to three other points. The first one is health claims in respect of children. We cannot see why health claims for children should be banned, as long as those claims are scientifically underpinned. It is, indeed, a good thing to carry out research into good food for children, but we do want to control advertising that is geared towards children, even if this is, strictly speaking, outside of this proposal’s remit.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns alcohol. I find it disappointing that some people, even within our group, are against the ban on claims for alcoholic drinks. If you consider all the problems involving alcoholism, damage to the liver and brain, you can hardly condone health claims for alcohol. In the case of alcohol, warnings are what are needed. We should not encourage the use of alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">A third and very important point is the question whether claims should be subjected to the licensing procedure or whether notification would suffice. In the case of a licence, manufacturers must be able to demonstrate convincingly that their claim is justified. In the case of notification, the onus of proof falls on the authorities, which means that a claim is permitted until such time as the authorities have managed to prove otherwise. That is what is at the heart of the legislative proposal and what our group is in any event against.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge everyone in this House to vote in favour of consumers and well<span class="bold">–</span>intentioned companies. We must not now bow to the pressure of companies that are frightened about being unmasked. The internal market is not a licence for misleading consumers. Let tomorrow’s outcome demonstrate to Europeans that Europe is there for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, it is the consumer who is central in this proposal, and that is important too. It is important that the consumer knows that claims about health, nutritional values or food cannot be untrue or misleading. That is what this proposal brings across and that is what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wholehearted supports.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, it is of course the case that those claims that are scientifically proven – those that are true – are useful to consumers. I do not want to talk about those in terms of advertising, for that, being profit<span class="bold">–</span>driven, has a nasty ring to it, but that too is important for consumers. Consumers want to be able to make a choice, and that choice has to be offered to them. It must be possible, though, to provide scientific proof. This is something we should not just accept reluctantly, but, I think, should welcome as enhancing the consumers’ freedom of choice and promoting innovation, and that too is of importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of there being a grey area around what should be done about those health claims about products that are, in fact, intrinsically unhealthy. As far as I am concerned, I would say that this falls within the scope of misconception, and Article 7 already provides for safeguards against this; we are not entirely convinced that we need European nutrient profiles for this. Nutrient profiles can be very useful. I know that Member States use them. They may work nationally, but whether they work at European level is something of which the Commission has not yet managed to convince us.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, I am campaigning in favour of the Constitutional Treaty in the Netherlands. I do not know if Mrs Corbey is doing the same – obviously not – but if I were to tell people in my country not to worry, for Brussels would soon tell them what they can and cannot eat, then this Treaty would be voted down completely. That is really not the message we can send out on the basis of arguments we have heard so far. I therefore want more specific arguments. The majority of our group will not be voting for the deletion of Article 4, but we do think that the Commission should present better arguments, and our Amendment 107 contains a request to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and – as I notice that my time is up – very briefly, since we are for reducing bureaucracy to a minimum, we have opted in favour of the notification procedure which we think offers sufficient guarantees for consumers and entails less mothering. On a final note, I agree that obesity must be discussed and tackled, but not in the context of this directive but much more in relation to the food labelling directive which we would have liked to have seen tabled by now. When you present it to us, Commissioner, then I think it will be much easier to talk about obesity as a problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know that the number of people, especially children and young people, who are overweight or obese is increasing rapidly. Scientists are sounding the alarm, because costs are exploding and will soon go off the chart. In Germany alone, diabetes costs us EUR 20 billion a year. We also know that voluntary agreements do not help. That is why we need clear legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 4 is key to protecting consumers from misleading advertising. That is also why we must not dispense with Article 4, the nutrient profiles. We must not rip the heart out of the bill. We should also correct the public’s misconceptions. This is not about banning products or advertising. It is about transparency and clarity for consumers, and innovation and competitiveness for industry. We have to be credible here. We cannot lament the exploding costs on the one hand, and then on the other quite openly become the mouthpiece for, say, a confectionary manufacturer and forget about consumer protection. We must not allow food with undesirable characteristics, food which is too sweet, too fat or too salty, to put on a cloak of good health.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you will not give way on consumer protection tomorrow, but that the European Parliament will again demonstrate that we want the nutrient profiles – the heart of the proposal – to be left in, and that we want them once again to blaze a trail for transparency and consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has been on the agenda for a few years and this is the second time that someone has produced a report on it. That this is a tricky subject is illustrated, moreover, by the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">For a split second, I thought that Mrs Bortone would now also throw in the towel, for the Committee’s vote completely undermined the Commission proposal and also the rapporteur’s report. Article 4 on nutrient profiles, which is crucial, was simply wiped away by one amendment. This article had to avoid foodstuffs such as crisps, chocolate and alcohol, which are intrinsically unhealthy foodstuffs, being labelled with health claims from which the consumer could deduce that they are healthy because they contain calcium, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Public health is thus really being taken for a ride and the food industry’s lobbying has won it the battle. In order to defend its position that a claim need not be based on a product’s real nutrient values, the Committee has used the same argument as the food industry, namely that there is no such thing as good or bad foods, only bad diets or customs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same breath, the Committee has brushed off the table the proposed licensing procedure and replaced it by a duty of notification. That means that the producer or importer of foodstuffs is only required to notify to a food agency that they use this or that claim without there being the need for scientific proof.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has tabled a number of amendments to rectify a situation that we find unacceptable. We want Article 4 reinstated, and let me finish off by saying that if it is not – not even in a diluted form – then we will be voting against the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, this has not escaped the attention of the food industry in its zeal for sales, which, we have also noticed, manages at times to find very innovative and positive ways of accommodating the consumer’s sensitivities.</p>
<p class="contents">What we establish today and what we have, in fact, known for years, is that summary legislation that exists at European level in this area is lagging behind and that it is therefore high time we adapted the legislative framework in a bid to protect the consumer effectively, provide them with useful information, offer sufficient legal certainty, which will, in turn, stimulate innovation and really harmonise the rules within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal meets these criteria in the sense that it allows for more fact, more benefit, better scientific underpinning and more harmonisation, but a number of changes, as already mentioned by fellow Members, must be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">An area which would benefit from cutting back is notification, at least the admission procedure for admitting certain individual claims. In our opinion, control is possible via notification, and a bureaucratic admission procedure is really a bridge too far. Also, we consider the nutrient profiles that are proposed in a proposal for a directive, to carry at least one claim, to be superfluous. That too is taking matters too far and other Members have indicated the reasons why.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that we should say that there is no justification for ruling out alcoholic products from any possible claim from the word go. We know that nothing has been left to chance, and that the Commission, the competent or representative organisations from all quarters, and also this House, have put an enormous amount of preparatory work into this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirteen years ago, I was a very green Member of this House. My first telephone call to the Commission was one to enquire about the progress made with the health claims, which were an issue as long ago as that. I am pleased that we are, at last, voting on them tomorrow, and I hope that the outcome will be a satisfactory one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She said that we ought to talk to the consumer groups in Europe and see what they think. Well, many of us have done so. I have a letter here, on behalf of 28 consumer groups in all of the Member States, and what do they say? They ask us to vote for Article 4 and for a sensible version of Article 11.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard what Mrs Niebler said earlier on in the debate and I was astonished by it. What in God’s name has all this to do with the Lisbon Process? I do not know about God – he has been around for a long time so he obviously has a healthy diet – but I know what I think and that is that the Lisbon Process, among other things, requires us to have well<span class="bold">– </span>informed consumers who make real choices which increase the marketability of the products they buy. Everybody benefits from that, it is a benign circle, and to have it denounced as though it is simply an instrument of the nanny state and so on, as we have heard in the course of this debate, is absolute rubbish.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally hope that we vote to retain Article 4. We need to have some way of dealing with the misleading claims which are made, which balance one substance against another, and only tell you about the one for which the claim could be made. The only way to do that is to have some effective template from which this can be made. The Commission has worked long and hard on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have many representatives of the food industry in my own constituency who have said that provided we just have that template within the Poli Bortone report, we do not then need it in Mrs Scheele’s proposals, we do not need it for fortification, but we should have it somewhere. And so we should. I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will return to my example: high in omega<span class="bold">–</span>3s. In principle, this is very good, but obviously not for products too high in fat, sugar or salt. The text refers to health and nutrition claims, not to advertising, as we heard here today. No product will be banned, and neither will advertising. Quite simply, the honest thing for these products would be to focus the advertising on pleasure, if manufacturers wish, and not on health.</p>

Recent research carried out by ‘Which?’, the UK consumer association, has shown that 98 per cent of people that it spoke to want health and nutrition claims on food to be authorised so that they can be certain that the food they buy is indeed the product described on the packaging with the qualities that are attributed to that product.</p>
<p class="contents">In my Group we agree that there is a need for authorisation, not notification, because self<span class="bold">– </span>regulation does not work. We need an authorisation procedure and, as others have said, we need to maintain the nutrient profiles – Article 4 – not least to protect children from being the targets of misleading advertising. Sixteen per cent of children in the UK between the ages of two and fifteen are obese, and the problem is getting worse. This demands a very strong response. We cannot allow foods that are high in salt or sugar to be marketed as being good for children’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to ensure better and clearer information for the public so that this important new legislation is as effective as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a major social problem but, perhaps above all, a major problem for the individuals affected. That is why there are also many individuals who try to shop more healthily and to choose healthier food.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, their attempts are unscrupulously exploited by companies that try to make products such as cornflakes, soft drinks and suchlike appear more beneficial than they really are. As a representative of the people, I do in actual fact think that those of us here in the European Parliament need to ensure that no consumer is duped into buying products they really do not want. We must therefore demand that the whole of a product’s content be taken account of when health claims are made. Otherwise, I for one shall not be able to support this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obviously especially important that no one be duped into buying drinks containing alcohol, with the problems we know they cause, in the belief that these drinks are beneficial. Health claims should not, therefore, be used on alcoholic drinks. In no respect is this, of course, a matter of prescribing what people should eat. Rather, it is about giving people the right and the opportunities to make well<span class="bold">–</span>informed choices for themselves. That is why I in actual fact find it hard to understand how, for example, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can think that companies should be entitled to mislead consumers. Do you really not believe that companies can manufacture products that consumers want, but that they have to dupe people into buying them? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But in the regulation this is to be achieved by restricting market principles, degrading citizens to sheep<span class="bold">–</span>like consumers and introducing a great deal of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic approach of doing more to promote a healthy diet and lifestyle is something that I support unreservedly. We must take action here. But the proposed means of doing so is inappropriate; it does nothing more than create the opportunity for an alibi, enabling us, in a few years’ time, to say: ‘We did something. It didn’t help, but we can wash our hands of it’.</p>
<p class="contents">Restricting advertising to the point of banning it surely also flies in the face of a whole series of scientific and political arguments. The idea of prohibiting the making of such claims about the nutrient profile on particular foods goes against the principle of food science, according to which there are no good or bad foods, but only a good or bad diet.</p>
<p class="contents">Across all of its committees, Parliament has sought to reduce consumer nannying, observe market principles and cut red tape. The elimination of Article 4 is the core of or basis for these changes. It is high time that you in the Commission also had a radical rethink of your procedures. Let us concentrate on informing consumers; let us close loopholes in the law to put a stop to the dishonest practices of a few economic agents, and let us create a climate in which it is acceptable to strive for a healthy lifestyle, which in itself has to be presented differently to each individual generation. You cannot live without salt or sugar. Mrs Corbey, I heard your first comments and am very concerned about your lifestyle. Soon there will be nothing left that you can eat!</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make another proposal, which could be a follow<span class="bold">–</span>up to yours. Why not determine human beings’ nutritional requirements on the basis of their body structure, with a computer chip inserted in the head, so that they can only go in certain directions in the supermarket and can only go to certain foods. That would be the epitome of consumer nannying, and then we would have only slim people in Europe. This is good advice I am giving you, so please take note of it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been inviting him for over six months and apparently he is far too busy to join us, but he would be very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Some weeks ago President Barroso assured us that he would ‘Lisbon<span class="bold">–</span>proof’ all legislation coming from the Commission. He mentioned REACH and the Services Directive. Could I ask that Commissioner Kyprianou bring this particular piece of legislation to his attention and immediately ‘Lisbon<span class="bold">–</span>proof’ it? There is far too much unnecessary red tape involved in it and it will place a very onerous and disproportionate burden on SMEs in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the basic principle behind the proposal before us that consumers should not be misinformed, but I have serious doubts about the Commission’s approach, especially in relation to nutrient profiles and implied health claims, i.e. Articles 4 and 11. This legislation smacks of the nanny state and verges on the patronising in its current form. Consumers bear the ultimate responsibility for their own food choices. Almost no foodstuffs are inherently bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Food consumption patterns are what is important. The emphasis should be on encouraging healthy lifestyles and healthy diets, not on censoring information, as is the case in relation to the so<span class="bold">–</span>called nutrient profiles in Article 4 of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Having consulted with nutrition experts from the University of Ghent and from Trinity College Dublin, I am convinced that the concept is not grounded in solid science and will have the adverse effect of depriving consumers of a great deal of information. Reference intake values are the accepted scientific norm today and should be used to ensure that labelling is clear, unambiguous and meaningful; they would greatly facilitate consumer choice, not least as a tool to fight obesity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made this point, I fully support the proposal to delete Article 4. As a fallback position, I support the proposal put forward by the PPE<span class="bold">–</span>DE Group and others at committee stage and now resubmitted by the ALDE, namely to decouple Article 4 by requiring a study into the scientific basis of nutrient profiles before making a decision on their implementation. This is a very sensible option.</p>
<p class="contents">All nutritional health claims should be scientifically substantiated according to scientific best practice. In particular, I would refer to the inclusion of a positive list of allowed nutritional health claims. I question whether this is legally sound, and it is a poor approach to legislation. It could lead to certain claims being banned by default because legislators were not aware of them at the time of drafting. Such an approach does not allow enough flexibility to take account of new products placed on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, just last month the Food Supplements Directive, which had a positive list of allowed substances, was found to be illegal by the Advocate General in Luxembourg. It is not yet clear what impact that will have on this nutritional health claims proposal. I would like the Commission to clarify this particular matter this evening. Will this proposal for a regulation also end up in a fourth reading in Luxembourg? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Markos Kyprianou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I wish to remind honourable Members of two facts. We are talking about health, the health of European citizens. We are talking at the same time of a marketing tool, of a means of making profit on the part of industry, voluntarily, without being obliged to do so. The industry chooses to use a health claim in order to sell a product. It is only logical that this claim should be based on science, should be accurate, truthful and correct. That is a very simple matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one thing to say consumers should decide. Do we expect every single consumer to have a PhD in chemistry or in biotechnology, or to set up a little lab in their house so that they can analyse every claim and test it to see if it is accurate or not? That is impossible; it is ridiculous; it will not happen. That is why we must make sure that the industry that chooses to use this marketing tool carries out the requisite tests to ensure it is providing correct information. As I said earlier, nobody wants a nanny state, but in our efforts not to have a nanny state, we must not go to the other extreme and abandon consumers, allowing them to be bombarded with inaccurate or misleading information. The result will be exactly the opposite of what was intended: it will be that the consumer will not trust any claim. Consumers will ignore even truthful ones, even scientifically based claims, because they cannot choose between the good and the bad claim, the correct and the incorrect claim. Therefore the tendency will be – and you heard earlier from Mr Whitehead about the consumers’ position – for them to ignore all claims.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure the industry does not want this. Yes, we support innovation, there is no question about that, but innovation based on science, not based on misleading information. We are not banning advertising. This is a misunderstanding and I have to make it clear that there is no question of banning advertising. We are concerned with the message the advertising contains. If it cannot be proved scientifically that a certain product helps health, the advertisement should just say the product tastes good, following the good old way of advertising a product. Not everything has to based on health claims if there is no scientific evidence for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, a correct diet is good, but for consumers to decide their diets they have to have the right information. Regarding the list, I think again there may be a misunderstanding. The list is not an exclusive list, its aim is to harmonise. Therefore, claims that have been approved will be able to be used by everybody, which will help the smaller industries because they will be able to draw on the list and use it without having to go through the approval procedure themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding SMEs, when it comes to health they have the same obligations as the larger industries. We just have to make it easier for them to meet these obligations. I agree that we have to simplify the authorisation procedures, but that does not mean that SMEs can make a claim that is not correct.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no intention to withdraw this proposal; it is very important. We have an obligation to the European citizens, a responsibility towards them to maintain this level of consumer protection. What we are trying to do is to empower consumers so they can use information that is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">Nutritional profiles are important, they have to remain. They will help ensure that claims are accurate and do not mislead the consumer. Also, the authorisation procedure is very important. Notification is not enough. It would not offer the necessary consumer protection, nor would it offer fair competition in the industry. However, we can discuss simplifying the procedures to make it easier for smaller businesses to meet the authorisation requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 11, on prohibited claims, can be softened. We can discuss which claims can be allowed and which ones not. There are a number of claims that could lead to an adverse effect, and they should not be allowed. But this is something which is open to discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">As for children, we all agree that there is a need to protect them. The question is whether this is the most appropriate legislation for doing so. We have other legislation, we have the directive on unfair commercial practices, which was approved recently. We also have non<span class="bold">–</span>regulatory procedures like the platform on obesity, which we launched recently. Through these legislative and non<span class="bold">–</span>legislative procedures we can offer protection to children. Applying this particular legislation to the protection of children would only complicate matters and not achieve the target.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, I apologise for exceeding my speaking time and I would like to say that a complete list of the Commission’s position on all the amendments is available to Parliament.
