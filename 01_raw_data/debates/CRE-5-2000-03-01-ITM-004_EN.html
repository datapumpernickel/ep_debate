<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span><span class="bold"> – </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination. The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission’s way of working. Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission. I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, these are the main points of the reform. One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources. This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board. In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance. In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point is human resources. It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission’s best asset, its richest resource. They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used. This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work. However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission’s staff is very low. Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism. All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility. These are the areas in which changes will be made. </p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management. This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security. We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General. At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system. This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related <span class="italic">ex ante</span> control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations. This is a complete revolution of the Commission’s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place. In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world. We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology. We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission. This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission. This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise. We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission. I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well. The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history – and I hope that it will remain closed forever. Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks. The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We need – the whole Union needs – a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions. This is why we are redefining all our work priorities. This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out – another important area of reform – in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity. For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently. We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission’s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them. We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence. The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone – on what we achieve. </p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution. Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms. The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: “Reforming the Commission”.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements. Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context. In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred. The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world. Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised. Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too. The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions – it is well understood everywhere. But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance. That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone. All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly. I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House. Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September. Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years. Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended. It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union. It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission. And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us. If they are <span class="underline">proven</span> not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority. If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities. On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability. That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.</p>
<p class="contents">In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital. The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time. The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital. Attempts to micro-manage the Commission’s operations are clearly in no one’s interest. A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.</p>
<p class="contents">In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable. Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals. I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon. It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.</p>

Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community’s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.</p>

<p class="contents">I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.</p>

And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions. That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may. The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms. Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern. Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside. And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later. And if we look at the original proposals – and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones – it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations. Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced. I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I want to make concerns information technology. Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old. By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour. I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices. I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not use those as an excuse. We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously. I would like everything to happen much more quickly. It is better to do it absolutely properly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out. We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">One of those obligations very clearly – and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this – is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union. One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.

<p class="contents">Two questions if I may. We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.

<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly – and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper – that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system? If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.

<p class="contents">So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented. It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands. It is conceivable therefore – I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage – that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to – I emphasise very strongly the conditional – we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision. That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain. Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control. I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission – that is certainly an objective – but it is simultaneously to “responsibilise” – it is an appalling word but we all know what it means. In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so. I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks. Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money. We are also interested in value for the people who work for us. The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made it clear in the course of the debates that we have been having in the past few weeks, in particular with Commissioner Kinnock – and in saying this I am taking up what Mr Cox said – that we cannot endorse the wholesale scrapping of independent financial control. Decentralisation, yes, but we certainly require independent financial control, i.e. a unit in the individual Directorates-General which are, however, directly subordinate to the Financial Controller. To do otherwise would be to make one and the same body responsible for authorisation and financial control.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have spelt this out again and again, and also made it very clear in Mr Van Hulten’s report of 19 January, in paragraphs 10 and 11 to be precise. Now so far I have not had sight of the White Paper and I would like to ask you Mr Kinnock: does it reflect our position? I have a question concerning ex-ante control, which is still to be carried out where necessary, and on an independent basis at that. I understood Mr Prodi to say – or I believe I understood him to say – that this ex-ante control will not take place as a matter of course, but neither will it be scrapped wholesale either, and the independence of financial control will be preserved. Is this reflected in the White Paper? I will read it with a great deal of interest and very attentively, but perhaps you could give me an idea now as to how these matters have been dealt with in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The question of transitional periods is worrying us. The expression “soft law” has been bandied about but there is no such thing. There is neither soft nor hard law.

I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control. There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation. However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it. So, the changes that we seek to make – as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts – are not negative in any way at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures. One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances. There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General. If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage. Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called “soft law”. We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call “hard law”. But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council. There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances. The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform. The first one is that people feel – for reasons I well understand – that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.</p>
<p class="contents">Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline. I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system. Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the system we currently have – as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly – is now unsustainable. Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction. Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another. In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union. How can we – the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries – meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries? The delegations are actively engaged – as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic – but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another. How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States. We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering. I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see. All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thank you for the presentation. It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public. That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time. It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork. Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control? That is a clear complaint that we get. That needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee. This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure. Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee’s work? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan. We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.</p>
<p class="contents">In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too. We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe. I know I can rely on everyone here.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
