<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zappalà (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">– (IT)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this House and I wish you and the entire House a successful two and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to vote on the directive on public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts and the directive on specific sectors – entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors – in plenary. The Commission worked on them for four years, conducting a series of hearings, studies and assessments. Then Parliament worked on them for a further two years. A very well-attended public hearing took place and the Committee of the Regions, trade associations and professionals from all over Europe were also consulted. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that such a huge amount of work has been necessary should not surprise us, considering that public works contracts take up around 15% of the Union’s total GDP, that is over EUR 1 500 billion. It is estimated that only 20% of that sum is actually covered by the provisions of the current directives in that the threshold above which it is mandatory to apply them is relatively high and, in any case, more or less equal to that laid down in the agreements for the participation of third countries. The current directives are now outdated and therefore need revising and bringing into line with new technologies and new market trends. It was precisely the need to increasingly develop the internal market which prompted the Commission to research and propose the directives in question. The subject is of considerable importance and could not and still must not be treated lightly. In addition to individual Members, four Parliamentary committees delivering opinions and the committee responsible – the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – examined the texts and tabled amendments: almost more than half this House has been able to examine, debate and amend the texts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a simple matter to summarise the contents: they revise and modernise the current directives, they introduce electronic auctions; they clarify the standards on technical specifications, they define rules on award criteria, they simplify the thresholds and they introduce a Common Procurement Vocabulary.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the proposals deserve our support and, indeed, have it: we are all aware of how important they are and we all want their path to be smooth. However, the most significant past and present problems which have emerged and which are the subject of debate within the different political groupings, and between the groupings and between national representatives need to be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The thresholds, or the value below which the directives are not binding. This value, which – as I have said – is already relatively high, corresponds, however, to the value laid down in the agreements with third countries, in line with the Commission’s proposal. It has been proposed to increase this value. That would raise two problems: it would reduce the number of work contracts required to comply with the directives, possibly to the advantage of third countries whose existing contracts cannot be reviewed. It would also allow contracting authorities to operate outside the common rules, with the associated risks. However, it has been maintained that, even if the thresholds are raised, the number of contracts awarded to European tenderers will not decrease because, below a certain value, it is not economically beneficial for businesses to operate away from their region, still less their country. A further consideration is the possibility that each Member State and each regional government could apply local rules where the threshold is not reached. That would mean that the higher the thresholds, the greater the disparities between legislation within the Union. Thus, the rules within the Union would become even less uniform.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, whatever the thresholds, we must not allow there to be differing legislation within the Union. That would shrink, rather than expand the common market; it would also make it possible for individual territorial legislative authorities to restrict access in their regional or national territory purely to local operators. This should only happen where the matter is not regulated by the directives. Thus, the general contents of the directives must be included in national or regional legislation as well, and an amendment has been tabled proposing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major issue is environmental and social concerns. It has been proposed that the directive should incorporate specific rules governing these areas. This suggestion has prompted broad, far-reaching debate and could lead to the report being referred back to committee if a position supported by a sufficient majority is not achieved at the vote. I feel that a law intended to further the internal market’s development in an economic sector and increase competitiveness cannot introduce principles which are not already laid down by the sector’s legislation. The Commission’s proposal contains sufficient provisions as it is to ensure that all the principles in force on the environment and workers’ rights are respected in the drawing up of calls for tender. This legislation cannot be expanded or altered by means of directives whose scope should be limited to works, supply and service contracts. The related amendments, adopted, moreover, at the vote by a number of committees delivering opinions and by the committee responsible, seek to introduce new rules. Were these amendments also to be adopted in plenary, I feel that it would be better to keep the current texts unaltered rather than to have texts which, although more up-to-date, could well mean a step backwards in basic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further issue which these texts cannot disregard but which the Commission has failed to deal with adequately: intellectual services. The time has come to make a clear distinction between intellectual services and executive services, between design and execution. This is a difficult concept for certain trade associations to take on board: as they see it, they are defending long-established positions. However, intellectual activity cannot be considered to be the same as manufacturing something and a company cannot do everything. It cannot carry out both design and execution, except in exceptional cases or where specific technologies are involved. There are two of reasons for this: <span class="italic">works of art</span> are not quantifiable: no two ideas are alike. The history of Europe as a whole, give or take a century, is full of different kinds of works which have survived the passage of time because of their artistic value. Not everything, not every service can be compared to a work of art, but the products of the mind cannot be confused with mere execution. An executing company possesses skills and experience and executive technology and is therefore the most suitable company to design and implement others’ ideas on a technical level, but that is all, with a few rare exceptions. By separating intellectual services from executive services we will be according the professions and the products of the mind their due value. Joint contract awards, where contracts for executive design alone and execution are awarded together, are appropriate if there are intellectual service providers qualified as such according to the prevailing legislation in the company or attached to it. These considerations are the basis both for the amendment which makes it possible to award contracts for the design and execution of works either separately or together but requires justification to be produced where mixed contracts are awarded, and for the amendment which clearly defines what is meant by preliminary project paper, final project paper and executive project paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, two directives are before Parliament which are essentially similar in that certain specific sectors have been liberalised or will be in the not-too-distant future. Telecommunications are already considered to have been liberalised and are therefore not being taken into consideration. The gradual liberalisation of the water, energy and transport sectors, monitored directly by the Commission or, upon request, by the individual States, will allow the second directive to expire without making it necessary to amend the first directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I hope that objective considerations will prompt us to adopt provisions which are specific to the sectors without expanding on them dangerously, provisions which will increasingly further the development of the internal market, which take into account the forthcoming accession to the Union of other countries which have their own traditions and needs, and which will make our rules increasingly uniform rather than fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I feel we ought to acknowledge that the work carried out by the Commission in its proposal deserves our greatest appreciation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have to say that I am proud to have helped to develop and, I hope, improve legislation which both contributes to the building of a more united, stronger Europe and also curbs the fraud and malpractice which very often prevail in economics. Precisely in order to prevent loopholes, it is better for the directives to suffer a setback, should this prove necessary, than to have rules which are too loose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Zappalà has just referred to the fact that, according to the Commission's estimate at any rate, 14% to 15% of the EU's GDP is accounted for by building and supply contracts and contracts to provide services, all granted by the State or by enterprises whose function is to provide services for the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Looked at in terms of actual figures, 15% of the EU's GDP of about EUR 900 billion per annum amounts to EUR 125 to EUR 130 billion, not a small sum by any means. In this very area of public contracting, though, the internal market has not yet prevailed to any particular degree. There is a need for change to be brought about here. The award of contracts across frontiers is still the exception. Regulations are complex, muddled, rigid, cumbersome and bureaucratic, and the integration of social concerns and environmental issues into procurement practice has not yet been clarified either. Those, at any rate, are the challenges Parliament itself enumerated in its debates on the Green Paper and the communication from the Commission in 1996 and 1998. It is for that reason that we must now focus on the economic objectives and those related to competition policy. Our aim is also to help bring the Internal Market to fruition in this area. There is a need for clear, transparent rules that do not discriminate against anyone tendering for these contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, though, there must also be the guarantee that nobody tendering for a contract can gain unjustifiable advantages for himself. It must therefore be made clear that standards must be adhered to as laid down by the law on labour, pricing and the environment. It is for that reason that Mr Zappalà is not quite correct when he argues in his final remarks that the economic aspects should be separated from the others. You cannot, of course, evade the other standards in order to gain an economic advantage. That is one of the ground rules that we all share, and it must also be obeyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is by ensuring that current legal provisions are complied with by all tenderers so as to avoid any unfair competition. I would ask Members to bear that in mind in the light of what the rapporteur said in his introductory remarks. We need to note in this respect that it is not a matter of social criteria – putting a question mark over the objective nature of the procurement process – but the very opposite: what matters is to create a level playing field for all those taking part in a procurement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second way in which we want social criteria to be taken into account is by enabling contracting authorities to pursue certain social and employment objectives, such as equal opportunities and social inclusion in connection with procurement. But this is always – again I would stress this in the light of what the rapporteur has said – subject to the strict requirement that it does not distort competition. This is made plain repeatedly in the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that were in turn inspired by the opinion of the Committee on Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Employment looked at the different stages of the tendering process and made a number of recommendations for each of those stages. At the first stage, the need for the inclusion of a reference to the law applicable should become a component of the contract documentation. Candidates, tenderers in a procedure, should have access to all the information on all social and employment criteria that they should be taking into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 27 is particularly important in the general directive in that respect. I would draw Members' attention to Amendment No 129 by Mrs Berger. It is an excellent amendment, which I hope will be supported by the House.</p>
<p class="contents">At the second stage we need to ensure that we have proper compliance with the standards laid down in the first stage and there should be a possibility to exclude people who have not toed the line in the past in relation to those social and employment standards. Article 46 is particularly important in that respect and I would draw Members' attention to Amendments Nos 82, 86, 87 and 89.</p>
<p class="contents">During the selection of candidates and the award of the contract, we need to ensure compliance with legal provisions relating to employment protection and working conditions. That is Article 53, which has attracted most attention in the discussions inside the Committee on Legal Affairs. I would draw Members' attention in that respect to Amendments Nos 134 and 140. I sincerely hope we can reach agreement on one of those amendments in our vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there needs to be an adequate review procedure to ensure that these criteria are applied in the execution of the contract. Amendment No 108, among others, is important in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw attention to one final amendment, which is important. It was highlighted in the opinion of the Committee on Employment and relates to sheltered employment. Amendment No 36 gives Member States the possibility to reserve certain contracts for sheltered employment schemes or sheltered workshops where the majority of workers in those schemes or workshops are people with disabilities. This is a longstanding issue in some Member States, in particular my own. I hope this amendment can be adopted tomorrow and we get a clear reference to this in the directive for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the main gist of the opinion of the Committee on Employment. These concerns are all reflected in the amendments to be considered tomorrow. I hope they will command the support of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here in the European Parliament, we try to do this in mainly two ways. Either we try, by means of directives and regulations, to ban or limit environmentally damaging activities; or we try, by means of directives and regulations, to encourage private individuals, companies and public authorities voluntarily to act in ways that reduce damage to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Zappalà that the time is quite simply past when purely economic criteria could be considered and that the EC Treaty now in actual fact obliges us to take account of social and environmental, as well as economic, factors. The two draft procurement directives must therefore make it possible for local authorities, county councils and state authorities to procure goods and services in such a way that there are minimal strains upon the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Commission’s proposal is odd in as much as it makes environmentally friendly procurement of this kind impossible. In the two opinions for which I have been draftsman in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have clearly incorporated the opportunity for taking account of the environment in procurement. These opinions were adopted in their entirety without any changes whatsoever, meaning that there had been a very strong and clear input from the Committee on the Environment. I have also been glad to note that the majority of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment have been adopted by the committee responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are nonetheless a couple of points on which the committee responsible has arrived at odd results. This is above all the case with the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts. Article 53 of this has to be changed so that it is significantly easier to take account of the environment in awarding contracts. In the second directive of the two – namely the proposal for a directive coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors –the same change is not, however, made to Article 54, which is of course identical to Article 53 in the directive first referred to. I presume this is an oversight, but I want in any case to draw attention to this and call upon everyone to vote in favour of Amendment No 140 to the report on the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes are significant. The two directives ought, as I said, to tally with one another. If the wording, ‘the most economically advantageous tender for the contracting authorities’ remains in place, it means that the contracting authorities do not need to take account of the environment or of life cycles and the interests of society in a broader perspective. It is therefore very important that we should in actual fact change this wording so that it agrees with that in the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">These criteria do in fact form part of the Sixth Environment Programme. They form part of the integrated product policy, and the rules must also of course promote, among many other things, sustainable development in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam. I cannot fathom the incomprehensible impairment of the existing directive by the Commission, which believes that adopting, for example, a life cycle perspective as an evaluation criterion is not permitted. However, this issue has been subject to legal proceedings . The Advocate-General has clearly come out in favour of its being my and the Committee on the Environment’s view that is correct, and not that put forward by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also extremely pleased about the changes made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because sustainable development involves having to take account of economic, social and environmental criteria. I therefore hope that we shall vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the Group of the Party of European Socialists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have an example in the field of the so-called Utilities Directive where legislation can achieve widely different effects whilst appearing to be neutral. If we say that the Directive applies to operations in municipal hands but not to those that are contracted out, we have then made enterprises with the same purpose subject to completely different legal regulations, and the effects are not neutral.</p>
<p class="contents">It was for this reason that a large and cross-party majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which does not otherwise have a reputation for particular concern for social and environmental matters, was prepared to take up these aspects in its proposals. I would like to take this opportunity to describe some of them clearly, as we did not just have discussions, but also incorporated into the present proposal significant results from the Industry Committee and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our most important proposal is that, in addition to the provisions of social security and labour law, collective agreements between employers and trade unions – as our proposal still terms them – should also be adhered to at the place of performance. I believe that the Industry Committee, in order to exclude the possibility of misunderstandings, might also find the formulation "generalised collective agreements" acceptable, especially as the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market opens the door to other misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">We must in any case make one thing clear, and I say this with reference to the Member State from which I come. We cannot have elements of the political spectrum there fomenting fears for the labour market on the grounds of the forthcoming eastward enlargement, while some of us in this House are engaged in opening the doors and thus possibly justifying their fears. We must not leave ourselves open to that reproach.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s acceptance of our demand that enterprises be liable to exclusion from the tendering procedure if they fail to comply with the provisions of the law on tariffs and other social security and labour law in the State of establishment or another affected country. We have incorporated in the Utilities Directive and in the draft under consideration today two important items of potential significance to municipal enterprises, one stating that associated or joint companies with at least a 50% average share in turnover shall be excluded from the scope of the Directive. That is in the text as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The other states that the supply of energy and fuel shall be excluded from the scope of this Directive, thus maintaining the current status quo against the background of the varying states of liberalisation prevailing in the European Union, and avoiding the situation I described at the beginning of my speech in which operations belonging to municipalities are treated differently from contracted-out enterprises. We are also in favour of postal services being covered by this Directive – not all kinds of postal service though, but only those for which there is as yet no free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">If my observation on the subject of tariffs is also included in the final vote, and if the points on which I have enlarged are taken into account, then that is a result with which I think the Industry Committee will be very satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to inform the House that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously adopted the opinion for which I am rapporteur on 12 June 2001. This unanimous vote is important, in that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully acknowledged that the procedures on public contracts were instruments falling under the sustainable development strategy and that the environment should be integrated across all the European Union’s policies, as advocated by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the relevant authorities, which have political responsibility, must be permitted to draw up environmental as well as social criteria that they intend to use in awarding public contracts, whilst, of course, respecting the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid repeating what other speakers have already said, I would like to draw attention to two points. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposed simplifying the award procedures, firstly by doubling the thresholds above which the directive applies for public contracts and, secondly, it is also proposing to give special protection to small and medium-sized companies by stipulating that the contracting authorities have the power to decide that 15% of the total number of contracts that they award can be granted to small and medium-sized firms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, though, exceptions to every rule. Not, of course, being unacquainted with the ways of the world, we are aware that we cannot carry on this debate on these new proposals by the Commission for a directive on the award of public contracts without taking their social and environmental aspects into account to some degree. It is therefore quite clear to us that social and environmental considerations of course play a part in this decision, but we are making a very clear distinction. We are of the opinion that, in the European internal market, the conditions for all who participate in this Internal Market should be equal. The key phrase ‘level playing field’ was mentioned by an earlier speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a ‘level playing field’ is of course guaranteed only when the criteria we are trying to add on alongside the economic criteria are already a component part of the tendering conditions and are not introduced or implemented only later, when the tendering process has been completed and discussion has moved on to the award. This has been the reason why, in the debate so far, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has always taken the view that, in so far as such criteria are also to be taken into account, they should be so under the heading of the tendering conditions and not left to be dealt with when the contract is awarded. I would therefore like to make it clear that Article 53, which was constantly being addressed and represented one of the main points of discussion and dispute, refers to the award. That is why the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats will take a restrictive approach when the amendments to Article 53 are voted on. We want Article 53, as proposed by the Commission, amended as little as possible. Only then can we guarantee that the possibility of manipulation does not eventually arise, with the authorities that invite the tenders ending up able to use, as it were, criteria introduced into the discussion retrospectively to come to decisions that have quite different backgrounds from those under discussion here and which are informed by objective criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as a quite crucial difference, one that needs to be brought out in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that has perhaps not yet become completely clear in the Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may say just one thing more, we are also opposed to incorporating conditions in the Directive that will in fact end up bringing the internal market to a standstill and causing it to fail, just as we are opposed to leaving those who will later transpose the Directive into national legislation free to include such conditions. For example, in Germany, my homeland, a so-called ‘tariff fidelity law’ is under discussion, which will in fact – and I share Mr Kuhne's view on this – mean that tendering will not be on the basis of the generalised collective agreements – which are like laws that one must obey – but rather on the basis of tariff agreements, ranging from regional down to in-house, a condition that will make it possible to put a contract out to tender in such a way that only one enterprise ends up being able to participate in the process. That smashes the Internal Market to bits. Such a thing is an absurdity, and one we are not prepared to go along with. We will therefore vote against such a possibility’s being opened up by means of amendments. It is, however, very much my view that what Mr Kuhne said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, namely that there should be no going beyond what is generally binding, is something that could certainly meet with support from me or from the Group I belong to.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group has not yet come to a final decision on the threshold values. We will be doing that in our group meeting before the vote, as there are differing views among us on the subject. I would, though, like to point out that Mr Zappalà has made a very interesting proposal. I refer to Amendment No 147 which is by way of a compromise in the event of an increase in the threshold values being decided on and is designed to ensure that the fundamental principles of this Directive apply to all contracts awarded under this threshold as well.</p>
<p class="contents">One could say at this point that this goes without saying, but the proposal includes a significant innovation, which I think would be a real step forward for the internal market – the justiciability of what we are doing here, and the justiciability of the tendering procedure. That is at present not guaranteed in all the Member States under the threshold. I believe that, if this were to be possible, it would represent real progress. In particular, I ask the Commission to reconsider their attitude towards Amendment No 147 and to inform Parliament tomorrow of whether they might give this Amendment their approval, because I think this could be a genuine compromise on the issue of threshold values.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank most warmly the rapporteurs, principally Mr Zappalà. This is one of this House's most problematic legislative proposals, and you have so far piloted us through its depths and shallows very well. For that you have my gratitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on behalf of my group and thanking him and all the draftsmen of the consulting committees' opinions for the enormous work involved in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already been occupying ourselves for a long time with these two draft Directives from the Commission, a good year and a half in fact. We had a public hearing on this subject a year ago. I think the intensive discussions and the highly laborious vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it high time that we complete the first reading with the plenary vote tomorrow – which I hope will actually take place.</p>
<p class="contents">The many amendments that we have had to deal with in Committee and, to some extent, still have to deal with in tomorrow's plenary session, do not mean that we were not in agreement with the Commission's basic premises. The consolidation of the previous Directives, and their harmonisation and modernisation, is certainly a very important step. As far as my group is concerned, in addition to a number of other important topics, some of which have already been addressed, there is a central issue on which we cannot agree with the Commission. I refer to the new criteria for the awarding of contracts, where the Commission is attempting very substantial changes in content in comparison with the former legal position, and what it is consolidating is not only current legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal dramatically restricts the room for manoeuvre which was formerly provided for and which is still current law, and does so above all at the expense of qualitative criteria, notably those to do with social security, the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">In its two interpretative statements, the Commission has itself shown how this room for manoeuvre and rearrangement can today be used without discrimination. The European Court of Justice, too, has handed down a very good and reliable interpretation of current law in indicative orders and particularly now in the final plea in the Helsinki case. The Commission appears to find the current legal position unacceptable for political reasons, and it is therefore to undergo massive alteration. A number of Members will probably be very confused at this point, as much of what the Commission thankfully sets out in its two interpretative statements will, by reason of the new legal position it has outlined, no longer be feasible if we do not vote any amendments to it tomorrow. Principals, such as municipalities for example, may now only think, in purely egotistical terms, of the immediate benefit to themselves. The economic advantage must unambiguously be the principal's. In Austria we call this the ‘Florian principle’ according to which it is better to let your neighbour's house burn down than your own. It means that factors occurring to the detriment and cost of another local or regional authority must no longer be taken into account when awarding a contract. The Commission also wants to prohibit the imposition of criteria relating to the manufacture of a product. This makes illegal, for example, an invitation to tender that specifies wood products from sustainable forestry or foodstuffs that are grown organically or derived from species-friendly animal husbandry and represents discrimination against conventional providers.</p>
<p class="contents">This not only undermines the objectives of the Treaty, for example the integration of environmental protection into all spheres of policy, and also a policy of sustainable development, it also restricts the autonomy and democracy of cities, municipalities, regions and federal territories. We are then using EU law to prohibit a democratically elected institution such as a city or a municipality from deciding to introduce, or continue with, an environmentally friendly purchasing policy. I do not believe that this will enhance the European Union's popularity among its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also, indeed, the perspective of Europe's cities and municipalities that leads to a majority of our Group’s advocating the raising of the threshold. Even in a small community like my own, in a country in which the climate means that building is very expensive, even the mere building of a school goes above the threshold. The costs of putting the work out to tender are significantly greater. Yet this amount cannot be cut back because it is still too low to attract tenders from other countries. It has already been emphasised that the rules of the Internal Market also apply below the threshold values.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in my concluding remarks, to appeal to the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats to change the position they adopted in committee on tendering conditions, even if only on a few points. We have brought in differing split votes on my Amendments Nos 134 and 110. I think, then, that it must be possible on this basis to further improve these points in the Commission's text.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thors (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, it is good that we are holding this debate at a busy time in the House and that we are not just engaging in legal hair-splitting, for the directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts are among the most important methods we have for preventing administrative corruption in the most effective way. We are talking about the most hated and most loved directives which have consequences quite far afield in the national administrations in various parts of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">During the hearing in the committee, I and many others besides me became concerned that so few cross-border offers are made. I think that the most important thing today, following this debate and reading, is that we obtain directives that operate as well as possible, together with an important follow-up mechanism. There is a lot left to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has already been said about environmental issues, but I think it is important for us to note that, on environmental issues, we must give public authorities the same opportunity we require the most progressive companies to exercise. Why should it not be possible to compete in this area within the public sector, just as it is within the private sector?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says that as much value for money as possible must be obtained. I want to say, however, that, in this context, it is quite often a question of self-governing local authorities which operate in such a way that, if a mistake is made and people are not satisfied, the latter can replace the decision makers. The decision-makers want to see good environmental decisions made by their local authorities. I also think there is something extremely seductive about the argument that, since we have adopted directives on how, for example, we are to promote the use of renewable energy, we should also have procurement directives that encourage such use. It is a familiar argument, but one worth mentioning. I share the assessment which says that the Commission’s approach in the proposal is rigid in relation to prevailing legal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a difference between the environmental and the ‘social’ issues. The basic conditions we have when it comes to environmental issues are relatively uniform, but we have extremely different directives where social issues are concerned. It is interesting to note that so many of those who have talked about social issues come from Germany. I come from a small EU country where my experience has shown that, precisely with reference to ‘collective agreements’, it has been extremely difficult for Finnish companies to enter the German, and also the Swedish, construction markets. That is why it is important for us not to adopt provisions that are ambiguous. The basic conditions are not uniform when it comes to social issues. We do not know which regulations are to be complied with in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I still hope, however, to be able to send an important signal on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Party, to the effect that if the proposals for increased threshold values are adopted, we shall not be able to support the proposals because, in our view, they limit this area of application still more.

<p class="contents">I shall describe a case which relates to these Directives, and which concerns my home city of Helsinki. Some time ago the Helsinki public transport corporation, being the public procurement authority, put out to public tender certain bus routes and set criteria stipulating <span class="italic">inter alia</span> that the buses to be procured were to have the lowest possible emissions; in other words, that they had to be environmentally-friendly. And so the City of Helsinki consequently opted to procure buses which run on natural gas and whose emissions are very low.</p>
<p class="contents">A competing bidder was not satisfied with this, but appealed to the national court, claiming <span class="italic">inter alia</span> that the City of Helsinki had selected a bid which was not the most advantageous one economically, in other words it was not the cheapest. The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice has recently issued his opinion on this matter, which may be adopted as the judgment of the Court. In fact the opinion of the advocate-general supports very strongly the view of the City of Helsinki that a public procurement authority should have the right to set environmentally-friendly criteria which it will use in its competitive tender, and also to select products in compliance with this. It is interesting that the position of the advocate-general is precisely the same as that of the Commission's Directorate-General which is responsible for environmental matters, and different from that of the Directorate-General which is responsible for the internal market. Now I would also like to draw the attention of Commissioner Bolkestein to this decision, which may well in fact become final; we do not of course know this as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">These Directives are of great economic significance: our obligation is to enable the rules of the game to be as transparent and straightforward as possible, and competitive tenders to be as open as possible, and also to ensure that public authorities are able to promote solutions which are environmentally friendly and also socially favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">To my esteemed and dear colleague Astrid Thors I would like to say that of course social legislation is different in the different countries, but perhaps this is the precise reason why we should also permit a public authority to comply with its own social criteria, and why we should find sustainable compromises between the political groups in these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like my fellow Members, who have underlined that this was a report of titanic proportions, requiring a great deal of work, I would like to use my two minutes’ speaking time to try to put forward what I personally believe to be the essential points, bearing in mind those involved, particularly the local and regional authorities and the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Zappalà report, which was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, improves on the Commission’s original proposal for a directive. On the pretext of simplifying and updating the existing legislation, the Commission’s proposal does indeed propose to make the regulations uniform, but the main way, if not the only way, it achieves this is through liberalisation and this is something I cannot accept. Thus, when it comes to using prices as a criterion for awarding contracts, the lowest price is favoured over social and environmental criteria. I believe therefore, as do other Members, that the stakes are very high. Given their activity, public authorities should favour employment and sustainable development but decisions are instead based on financial criteria alone. However, in March 2000, the European Trade Union Confederation pointed out how much importance the Community regime for public contracts placed upon the concept of price, to the detriment of social and territorial cohesion, equality and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the Zappalà report improves on the Commission’s directive, particularly by raising the thresholds on opening up public procurement contracts by 50% and also by taking into greater consideration the social and environmental criteria. If adopted in its current form, I think it might represent an improvement on the current situation. Despite this, it is essentially the approach of liberalisation that is favoured.</p>
<p class="contents">In a communication of 15 October 2001, the Commission was forced to put forward the option of integrating social and environmental aspects into procedures for the award of public contracts. However, this communication is not legally binding in character. We must therefore go further and approach it in a different way; this is the sense of the amendments tabled by my group. Within the award criteria, employment, the environment and town planning must be put on the same footing as economic cost. Of course, my group’s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee’s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Vice-President. I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur and all the draftsmen on their work on what may appear to be a very simple topic but, when you get into the detail and analysis of it, proves extremely difficult. Rather than repeating what has been said already, I would like to deal with three particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to raising the limits on when tenders have to be put out for consultation, looking for the 50% increase is important because it has already been proven that the present limits do not allow for greater cross-border interaction between companies and between companies and agencies. This is because the contract limit is too small and the economic reality underlying this is that to move your operation into another Member State requires extra money and a more valuable contract to make such a move profitable. There is no point in saying that we should be spending public money merely to prop up a failing or ageing system. We should be using the money properly – of course to increase infrastructure, to provide better services and to increase local employment as much as possible – but it should not be used merely as a substitute for private and other investments or for other initiatives to create local employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area, concerning environmental considerations, is another very important question. It is one in which each and every one of us would agree that certain minimum standards have to be laid down. We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that we put in place proper controls and mechanisms to guarantee that what we pass on to future generations is in a better condition than that in which we received it. However, that should not be used as an obstacle or a block to development. There is a happy medium and a balance between both, which must be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns social obligations, and in particular I agree fully with the Members who said that there must be a social return for the contracting authority and its area from the awarding of the contract. However, it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria. Of course we must have protections in place to ensure that those who are guilty of wrongdoing, fraud, racketeering and of interfering with Community assets and finances should be excluded from public contracts. However, I have one concern with regard to the question of a judgment that is not yet final: we are acting as judge and jury in denying somebody a right to be an applicant for a tender without having a final decision or analysis made as to whether that person is guilty of a crime or not. This is something we must be very careful of.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is about time that these directives were brought together, that the texts were clarified and that greater certainty was put into the legislative framework under which people have to operate. But, most importantly of all, it must be seen as a move towards guaranteeing better public services for all people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to consolidate and modernise the present procurement directives. This is with good reason, for they are too complex and too bureaucratic for contracting authorities and industry alike.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we realise political ambitions via the public procurement procedures? This question seems to be at the heart of the long-term discussion on this topic. Via Amendment No 98, this report wishes to add both social and environmental criteria to the assessment of the most favourable tenderer. Environmental criteria – a European area of policy <span class="italic">par excellence</span> – can be measured objectively by means of management standards and can therefore easily be deployed in practice. However, we believe that it would be taking matters too far to prescribe at European level that national bodies must take account of social criteria in their assessment. Social policy is to be established nationally, and that is how it should continue to be. Furthermore, this amendment would make the procedure considerably more complex, both for the contracting authorities and the tenderers. It could lead to all kinds of new points of contention and differences in interpretation. This is why the directive would become just as difficult to implement as the current one.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly support the exclusion of economic operators that have been convicted of offences. In my country, there are currently various criminal cases pending against building contractors, and it seems as if fraud is becoming a widespread phenomenon. This text drives the message home to industry: you do not mess with public money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Procurement in the EU accounts for EUR 1.5 billion per year, EUR 40 million of it in Sweden alone. The figures show the importance of clear and simple ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to compete on equal terms. If the EU is to become the world’s most competitive market by 2010, small and medium-sized companies need to be given a boost and the conditions under which they operate made easier for them. It is important to maintain the threshold values in order to obtain solutions that favour consumers and stimulate competition. In that way, we can increase the number of purchases and create the basic conditions for a European procurement market. It would prevent protectionist behaviour in national markets and – something which is not to be sniffed at – make it easier for politicians to be thrifty with people’s taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear rules must also apply to environmental and social considerations. The two directives we are debating today are financial directives. If and when account is to be taken of environmental and social factors, this should happen when the procurement criteria are established. In that way, the rules for those who submit offers will become clear, and they will know what prior conditions apply to procurement. It is the tenderer with the financially most advantageous offer to whom the contract must be awarded.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to agree completely with what Mrs Thors said about her experience of small countries engaging with the German market. I have the same experience where my own country is concerned. Nonetheless, I also want fully to acknowledge my country’s extreme uncompetitiveness in the construction sphere, something which also leads to our having high housing costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal must be to raise the quality and reduce the costs of cross-border procurement by simplifying it and making it more efficient and widespread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of laws are like our favourite clothes. If we do not look after them, they rapidly become unsightly and end up being unusable. They no longer fulfil their purpose. So it is only a good thing that the Commission has taken in hand the law on the award of public contracts, which dates back to the Seventies, and that we are now engaged in doing justice to the requirements of modern times and of the Internal Market with two directives. A certain amount has already been said about the modernisation of the directives on the award of public contracts, and I do not need to add anything to that. I would, though, like to sound a clear warning that we may be improving the law on the award of public contracts in technical terms and making it more manageable, but at the same time causing its substance to deteriorate. That is what the Commission intends with its proposed text, in which the smoothly functioning internal market and competition sweep all before them. People's justifiable desires and interests are neglected. That is something this Parliament must not permit.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty is not to any old mechanism or economic ideology. Our duty is to the citizens of Europe and their needs, and we are, moreover, obliged to see to it that their taxes are not squandered. A well-functioning internal market can help in this if it adheres to people-friendly standards. Public contracts cannot, then, simply be awarded to the lowest bidder. Social requirements must, as criteria, be no less decisive than consideration for people's health and careful treatment of the environment. That is why there are amendments tabled by my group, and, in my view, if they are not adopted, it will be impossible to vote for the Directive on the award of public contracts. Let me give an example. It is, of course, obvious that contractors must abide by regulations on industrial safety and working conditions as well as by all the other collective and individual provisions of labour law. This also includes adherence to the wage agreements in force where the principal is located. Without that, we easily end up in a spiral of discrimination and wages dumping at the expense of many workers' families. Competition in the internal market must not be allowed to be like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition must not be pursued at the expense of the environment, and so it is perfectly clear that public principals must require the maintenance of high environmental standards. Let me close with a word on the threshold values for European tendering. Since the existing threshold values have demonstrably failed to bring about any increase in cross-frontier exchange in the sphere of public contracting, we need have no qualms about raising them. Speaking personally, I have no problem with the idea of doubling them. Raised thresholds deter unjustifiably high expenditure on smaller projects, promote greater flexibility in the planning and realisation of manageable projects and contribute to the careful use of money raised from tax. The public will thank us if we do not oblige their mayors to throw the money out of the window with both hands.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to apologise to Mr Zappalà and also to the Commissioner for the fact that I cannot stay to the end; a party of visitors has been waiting for me since four o'clock, and I really must get to them, although I would actually have liked to stay to hear the Commissioner's reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also, in the context of the internal market, about encouraging cross-border tendering and working: 15% of EU GDP – that is an important input in achieving public policy aims. We should be looking to achieve best value for our citizens and a transparent process for those tendering. But best value can never be based on purely financial criteria. Price alone can never be a complete measure of what is in the public interest, of what is the most advantageous offer.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember, as the member of a local authority, seeing a council waste time, effort and money trying to unscramble a valuable school meals contract that proved to be totally unsatisfactory. Yes, the price was right, but only the lawyers won.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals pursued by public authorities are justifiably, in the public interest, a mixture that includes environmental and social goals. As long as the playing field is level and the procedure is absolutely transparent, such goals and choices can and should be valid, as the ECJ has recently confirmed. Such choices, indeed, are a valid and intrinsic part of local political life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have brought credit on our constituency in the dignified and splendid way you have conducted yourself over recent weeks and we are very pleased with that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In that constituency, as you well know, it is not taken for granted that what is publicly provided or done is bad and only what is privately done is good. Nor does the Commission take that view. But, as Mrs Wallis has just said, this debate focuses on the very question of what decisions are properly taken by the public authorities, by democratic procedures on the basis of public choice, and what must then reasonably be left to the market to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial for that dividing line to be got right. Mrs Hautala asked a question which the Commissioner must answer when replying to this debate today. It is a question which can also be addressed to Mr Zappalà, who says that we should only take economic conditions into account, not, for example, environmental or social ones. If Helsinki or Edinburgh became seriously polluted with diesel fumes, that would give rise to costs. Somebody would have to pay to clean them up eventually. To say that is a non-economic cost is simply an odd kind of economics. So we turn the thing round: we ask who shall decide if the streets of Helsinki or the streets of Edinburgh need environmentally friendly and sustainable buses? Who can best take that decision? Is it best taken in Brussels? Is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament? Is it best taken in London? No, it is best taken in Edinburgh or in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a decision of that kind to be taken locally. Of course, we do not want that decision to lead to unfair consequences. It must be open and transparent. Who can come and bid for this contract and on what terms can they obtain it? That is fine, but do not exclude the local authority, the people of a region, from saying themselves what standards they demand of those who serve them. If that is to be ruled out by European law, Europe will not grow in popularity among its citizens. We must have this kind of clear responsibility for the public good taken by public authorities. I would like to hear the Commission's reply to that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, may I too offer my congratulations to you on your election as first Vice-President.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to provide a different perspective on the debate this afternoon. In this debate we have not heard from the people who are now supplying public authorities across the European Union as a result of the tremendous progress that has been made in opening up public contracting all over the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So far we have heard nothing this afternoon about the people who are driving the economy forward because they are getting open access to tenders, cheaply and readily available by electronic means. That applies to businesses, organisations, service providers, manufacturers, contractors all over the European Union. A few weeks ago I went to see one of those companies in my constituency. It employs 80 people. Every morning it logs on to the <span class="italic">Official Journal</span>. Five or six tenders are listed there, all for the United Kingdom. This company does not at the moment have export ambitions but the <span class="italic">Official Journal</span> gives it cheap, ready access to customers in public authorities to a standard format. It fulfils and puts in tenders for them every week.</p>
<p class="contents">In this perspective I want to look at the balance between economic, environmental and social issues. That company in the Black Country in the United Kingdom employs 80 people, that is 80 much-needed jobs, and it complies with every single social requirement in United Kingdom law. It complies with all the environmental rules in United Kingdom law. It is perfectly entitled to apply for a contract. Why should that be otherwise? Why should it have to do anything else? This is primarily an economic instrument. That is what it was designed to be to begin with. We may want to add to its social burdens – and plenty of colleagues over there would like to do that. We will have many more debates with Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and other colleagues about adding to the requirements to improve the safety and health of their workers. That is fine. If companies comply with that, they should be entitled to apply for contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up on Mr MacCormick's points, because methinks he protests too much. On the question of the Helsinki bus contract, surely it was up to the Helsinki authorities to decide, before they put the contract out to tender, what was the optimum and most environmentally friendly bus that they wanted? It is not part of public contract to require the bus manufacturers to do an environmental appraisal for Helsinki before they then submit the contract. If the Helsinki authorities had said that they wanted 100 buses powered by natural gas and that is the contract, then fine, if that is what they want to do. But it should be done on an open and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to turn to this question of thresholds. This seems to be the most extraordinary debate. I particularly refer to one of the opinions from EMAC, in which our colleague, who unfortunately is not here, said he wanted to simplify matters by raising thresholds but at the same time he wanted to allocate 15% of contracts to SMEs. Does he think that by removing a substantial number of contracts from the public procurement regime, by raising thresholds, he is going to improve the situation for SMEs? What sort of world are we living in?</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area where we want SMEs to compete. We want local authorities to put in contracts on a consistent open basis that will give our citizens value for money. We want to oblige them to do that. Just because they find it difficult, because they think it costs them money – probably because they do not want to comply with all the requirements – they want more discretion to give contracts not on an open basis. That is what raising this public threshold is all about. We should not do it. It will undermine the value of a system that is working well already. That is what we should be looking at: improvement, not destruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed they are benefiting from providing euro slot machines for public authorities even though Britain is not in the euro zone. There are lots of opportunities here. But I want to direct some very pertinent questions to the Commissioner and I hope he will answer those questions in his response.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we need some clarification regarding thresholds, as Mr Harbour has indicated. I would genuinely like to know what would be the effect on the public procurement market if thresholds were to be increased, and particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises and on consumers. I would also like to know, as regards our international obligations under the WTO general procurement agreement with third countries, whether it would be the case, as has been established by Commission services, that the US and Japan would actually be favoured contractors and that our EU suppliers would lose out because we would be operating two distinctly different regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise questions on the social criteria. Members have already stressed the compatibility of incorporating strong social progress criteria in award procedures while respecting the principles of competition law and of equal treatment and non-discrimination. It ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles. I cannot understand why, if we have a system of transparency and open competition, how we cannot prevent that from being used as a protectionist smoke screen in the publication of tenders. Why has the Commission not incorporated the full force of good practice from European case law into the body of this directive to ensure that we guarantee the highest social and economic standards in public procurement? Surely we owe that to our public authorities, to our consumers and indeed to our businesses. Why has the Commission gone down the route of a voluntary approach?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will accept the amendments mentioned by my colleague, Mr Hughes, to allow for reserve contracts for sheltered employment schemes. I hope it will respect Parliament's wishes for a strong line to be taken in this directive, ensuring compliance with core labour standards and permitting the exclusion of those in breach of those standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has far more impact than would appear at first sight. Annually, thousands of contracts are awarded by public, often regional or local, governments. At the moment, public procurement is said to account for approximately 14% of the entire European GDP. However, existing legislation is too complicated and complex, as a result of which, to date, this market segment has been far too much hidden from the benefits of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The current report, therefore, cannot afford to miss its target, namely the simplification of legislation and greater opportunities for European procurement procedures. For these reasons, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, I am opposed to raising the thresholds too high, as a result of which a meagre 8 to 12% of all procurements in the European Union would fall within the scope of this regulation. In addition, the introduction of social and environmental criteria must be handled with care. Too many conditions that are too wordy once again make matters much more difficult, both for our towns and municipalities and for our SMEs. We must realise that they will bear the brunt of this European legislation. We must bring them closer to Europe and get them to spread the European message. This is certainly not achieved by issuing an unhealthy number of rules and regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I admire him most of all for not losing his Roman cheerfulness despite what was at times a very difficult process. Many thanks also to my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where we had what I think was one of our most interesting debates to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions in this House have also shown that views on threshold values and social standards cut across Group lines, and we can look forward to tomorrow's vote with great excitement.</p>
<p class="contents">I see a requirement for the new Directives to be progressive, fair and functional. We support the modernisation proposed by the Commission, for example with regard to the introduction of electronic auctions and the electronic submission of tenders. What greatly worries me, though, is that on one point the Directive is not being made fairer. I am referring here to the issue of social and environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for the benefit of the other members of my group that I would like to expressly reiterate that the issue is not, for us, that social and environmental criteria have no part to play in the procedure whereby contracts are awarded. No! Mr Hager has shown that very clearly. These standards must be laid down in the description of the product. We want to avoid the situation where, when the contract is awarded at the end of the process and the tenders have been compared and it is clear that tender no. 1 is the best in economic terms, no. 2 is worse, no. 3 is even worse than that and no. 4 is the worst of all, there is then another assessment which establishes that one firm is more socially responsible because it employs more disabled people and another more ecological because it has a waste management system, whereupon it is decided, despite the fact that there was another tender which was better in economic terms, to award the contract to the more expensive firm after all. That is the situation we want to avoid, for it would run counter to the internal market. That is why this is such an important point for us, and a Directive with standards of that sort would basically be no use to us anymore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The battle for social and environmental criteria, which was won mainly thanks to the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, proves that the European Parliament still basically supports the European social model and sustainable development, which is the only way to make Europe competitive in a global environment. The amendments to the social and environmental criteria, which have to be evaluated in tandem, do not impose any new obligations or costs on companies; they merely state the obvious, i.e. that we need to respect the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>when it comes to protecting work and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same vein, the position taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that contracts could contain terms to encourage the recruitment of minorities or excluded persons and combat employment, should be adopted unanimously. Now it has been agreed that employment policy needs to be mainstreamed, adopting this position would confirm that we believe and mean what we say.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also encouraged by the new paragraph in Article 7 calling not just for a legal framework for protecting work to be defined, but for it to be aligned with Convention No. 94 of the International Labour Organisation and the directive on the secondment of employees. Meeting minimum labour standards in international conventions is one of the fundamental obligations of the developed countries in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question which we addressed was the question of thresholds. I think that, in doing away with thresholds, we really have warded off the danger of excluding small and medium-sized enterprises from the market, which is, of course, what would happen if they had to compete, with the complex procedures in the directive, with large companies at Community level. This amendment therefore helps employment and helps companies to remain viable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Commission to include other means in procurement by electronic means, not just the electronic auctions which are held on the market. By which I mean certain models of public procurement, such as electronic catalogues, electronic government purchasing methods and a series of corresponding electronic means used by companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Local authorities and state organisations must therefore naturally be entitled to take account of the environment, the working environment and social goals when they procure goods and services. This is a right, Mr Harbour, and not a duty, even if you repeatedly try to present it as such. It is a right that local authorities must be given, with due attention having to be paid, of course, to ensuring that there will be no question of a distortion of competition. The EU has, of course, some splendid objectives in both the environmental and social areas but, if we do not integrate these objectives into all EU legislation, then little progress will be made and we shall not get anywhere. The public sector must be able to make environmental demands of the products it purchases, and it is particularly important to emphasise in this connection that it must be able to impose requirements upon such products throughout their whole life cycles. It is surprising that the EU’s own eco-label has been given so insignificant a place in the Commission’s proposal and, when the public sector prepares technical specifications, it must naturally be able to refer to the EU’s own eco-label. By means of a number of amendments, we have tried to integrate social and environmental considerations. I hope that, this time round, the Commission will take a positive view of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In May 2000, the Commission adopted two proposed directives designed to simplify and modernise Community public procurement rules. Those proposals contain significant new developments to adapt the directives to modern procurement requirements. In the interest of simplification, the Commission has proposed a recasting of four existing directives merged into two new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that Parliament has taken advantage of this recasting of the four directives to question the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> in areas where the Commission has not proposed any changes. I refer here in particular to the amendments raising the thresholds, which will significantly reduce the directives' scope, above all – may I say to Mrs McCarthy – with respect to small and medium enterprises. If those proposals were to be adopted, the Commission would have to give serious thought as to whether the proposal should be retained at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are to be welcomed. The Commission supports those amendments which add to the simplification and modernisation process. They are Amendments: Nos 1, 3, 167, 141, 4, 13, 16, 17, 24, 28, 34, 36, 174, 40, 50, 128, 53, 79, 80, 85, 88, 97, 109 – to the extent that it concerns production processes – and 112.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept the substance of a number of amendments, subject to some drafting changes, namely Amendments Nos 2, 10, 42 in part, 45, 46, 47, 123, 52 in part, 93 and 95 in part, 109, 110 and 154 concerning the extent to which environmental considerations can be taken into account at different stages of an award procedure. Similarly, Amendments Nos 11, 15, 48 in part, 51, 129, 52, 86, 87, 124, 89, 100 in part, 110 and 164 concerning the need to ensure that tenderers comply with employment law, can be included in the directive in an appropriate form. That is also partially the case for Amendment No 163 concerning information on sub-contracting.</p>
<p class="contents">Various amendments designed to address the increasing centralisation of procurement are also acceptable, subject to some redrafting, namely Amendments Nos 5, 6, 20 in part, 126, 21, 41, 168, 172 in part and 175.</p>
<p class="contents">In a similar vein, Amendment No 38 concerning consortia formed by contracting authorities and Amendments Nos 39 and 40 are also acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments add to the broad range of electronic means available to contracting authorities, namely Amendments Nos 23, 54 and 65 concerning reverse electronic auctions, as well as Amendments Nos 74 and 104, which deal with the integrity and confidentiality of data supplied by operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning confidentiality of data, part of Amendment No 31 can be accepted, though Amendment No 77 would then be superfluous and would have to be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Various amendments concerning the competitive dialogue, in particular as regards payment of participants, can be taken into account, more specifically Amendments Nos 9, 56, 57 in part, 58 in part, 137 in part, and 138.</p>
<p class="contents">Various amendments which I would describe as explanatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 7, 125 in part, 18, 142, 26, 30, 35, 46 in part, 70, 113, 114, 121, 132, 153, 169, 170 and 171. Subject to drafting changes, the substance of Amendment No 147 concerning the applicability of the Treaty below the thresholds is also acceptable, if placed in a recital.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which call into question the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex. Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following amendments:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments to raise the directives' thresholds – as I said earlier – by 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directives a large number of contracts currently covered, namely Amendments Nos 32, 33, 67, 130, 101, 105 and 106. The unfortunate consequences of these amendments are not alleviated by Amendment No 147, however good its intentions. In fact, the raison d'être of the directives is not in itself sufficient without the detailed procedural rules of the directives to guarantee uniform and legally certain application and to safeguard the rights of economic operators through efficient remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of public contracts from Community competition, namely Amendments Nos 37, 38 in part, 122, 136, 150 and 157.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations, namely Amendments Nos 12, 14, 98, 134, 140 and 166 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic – and in particular social and environmental – criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement, namely Amendments Nos 70 in part, 73, 75, 102, 103, 115, 117 and 131.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through the regulation of subcontracting and other requirements, namely Amendments 42, 48 in part, 49, 76, 100 in part, 116, 133, 152 and 159.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which reduce transparency in calls for competition, in particular Amendments Nos 62, 68 and 78, and which extend the scope to negotiate, namely Amendments Nos 57, part of 61, 66 and 151.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which restrict the use of framework agreements with no apparent justification, namely Amendments Nos 25, 27, 135, 139, 63, 64 and 158.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments introducing environmental considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directives, namely the part of Amendment No 45 concerning eco-labels, No 92 concerning the selection stage and No 109 regarding the definition of technical specifications and their compatibility with the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of the competitive dialogue, in particular Amendments Nos 55, 58 in part, 59, 60 and 160.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments containing additional cases where persons convicted of certain offences would face mandatory exclusion; in the proposed mechanism, only those cases subject to criminal sanctions in all Member States should be included. It is not, therefore, possible to take account of some of these cases, namely Amendments Nos 81, 82 and 83. On the other hand, some of these cases are already covered by the optional exclusions contained in Article 46(2). Amendments Nos 84 and 90 should also be rejected, since they could lead to a situation where it is not possible to contract with a company which is trying to re-establish itself financially.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which are superfluous or likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason, namely Amendments Nos 8, 19, 20 in part, 22, 29, 30 in part, 43, 127, 44, 45 in part, 55, 59, 60, 69, 70 in part, 71, 72, 94, 96, 108, 111, 143, 156, 162, 172 in part and 173.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which, without justification, detract from the powers delegated by the legislator to the Commission under existing law, namely Amendment No 107.</p>
<p class="contents">The last category of amendments not acceptable to the Commission as regards the first proposal are those amendments which remove clarificatory changes designed to create greater legal security, namely Amendment No 99 on the weighting of award criteria, Amendment No 100 on abnormally low tenders as a result of State aid, Amendments Nos 144, 145, 146, 148 and 149 modifying the definition of works contracts, and Amendment No 161 on the principles governing time limits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the second directive, the so-called Utilities Directive, it is the second proposal adopted by the Commission in May 2000. Besides the objectives of simplification and modernisation, which I just mentioned, this second proposal is particularly aimed at reviewing the scope of the directive in the light of ongoing or future liberalisation of the sectors concerned. This proposal is also a recasting of the existing texts, with the proposed changes incorporated in a single text. I can only repeat the misgivings caused, in particular, by the proposed amendments concerning the threshold values.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are therefore to be welcomed. The Commission supports the amendments consistent with the line it has taken, such as Amendments Nos 2, 7, 21, 37, 43, 47, 95, 111 and 116. The Commission can also – although somewhat reluctantly – accept Amendment No 29, given the large consensus on this amendment in both Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject to drafting changes the Commission can equally accept the substance of a large number of amendments:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3, 18, 34 in part, 35, 36, 38, 40, 64, 87, 89, 92, 96, 99, 101, 118 and 119 concerning technical specifications, the possibility of taking environmental concerns into account at various stages of an award procedure and means of proving technical and financial capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4, 9, 44 in part, 56, 90 in part, 93, 97 in part, and 108 in part concerning observance of other legislation, in particular social legislation, clauses relating to the execution of contracts and provisions concerning sub-contracting.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 57, 59, 60 and 109 concerning exclusion criteria are acceptable in part to the extent that obligatory exclusions are limited to contracting entities which are public authorities and that the list of grounds for obligatory exclusion corresponds to that provided for under the Public Sector Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 66 in part, 67, 68, and 69 regarding simplification of the provisions on mentioning the relative weighting of award criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 70, depending on language versions as changes are not required for certain of them, concerning abnormally low tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 76 on the coal and solid fuel sector is acceptable to the extent that it requires voluntary application of Directive 94/22 to be taken into account for the purposes of Article 29, however without such voluntary application being associated with any legal presumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, and 86 concerning increased transparency on remedies. Subject to acceptance of the substance of the Commission's proposal on Article 29 the Commission could also support Amendments Nos 13 and 16 concerning transferral of entities offering postal services from the Public Sector Directive to the Utilities Directive. The objective of allowing economic exploitation of coal-generated heat at the heart of Amendment No 15 will be taken into account through the acceptance of Amendment No 29. As drafted the amendment is not acceptable as it would have quite different effects from those intended.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the issue of contracts awarded between related entities, Amendment No 27 is acceptable in part, as far as the possibilities of awarding service contracts to newly created, affiliated undertakings and of awards of certain service contracts to a joint venture are concerned. Amendments Nos 51 and 75 concerning preservation of confidentiality in respect of information forwarded by electronic means are acceptable. Various amendments which I would describe as clarificatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 22, 30, 53, 113 in part, and 117.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which question the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and which detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex. Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments to raise the directive's thresholds by approximately 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directive a large number of contracts currently covered or otherwise greatly reduce transparency; namely Amendments Nos 20, 46, 72, 102, 105 and 107.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of contracts from Community competition; namely Amendments Nos 6, 19, 24, 25, 26, parts of 27, 28, 45 and 84.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which would substantially change the conditions provided for in Article 29 and Annex X for the Commission to grant legally binding exemptions in the case of liberalisation having resulted in effective competition or which would create inconsistencies between this directive and other Community legislation: Amendments Nos 31, 58, 76 insofar as its inclusion in Annex X would create a legal presumption, and 77.</p>
<p class="contents">Those amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations; namely Amendments Nos 8, 17, 65, 94, 104, 110 and 122 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic criteria, in particular social or environmental criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement; namely Amendments Nos 49, 50, 73, 74 and 103.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through regulation of subcontracting, in Amendments Nos 32, 41, 42, and amendments introducing social considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directive, namely Amendments Nos 33, 55, 62, 63, 71 and 88.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments on technical specifications either introducing environmental considerations in a manner incompatible with the directives or introducing improper requirements concerning equivalence of technical solutions; namely Amendment No 34 for the part concerning eco-labels, 36 for the part concerning costs, 39, 91, 98 and 100.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of this directive, which is applicable to both public and private commercial entities, and amendments transferring provisions from the public sector directive without good reasons, namely Amendments Nos 10, 11, 52, 54, parts of 59, parts of 60 and Amendment No 61.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments which are superfluous, would create significant legal uncertainty or are likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason; namely Amendments Nos 1, 5, 12, 14, 23, 48, parts of Amendment No 66 on the weighting of award criteria, 106, 112, 114, 115, 120, 121, 123 and 124.</p>
<p class="contents">In my reply to Parliament and in view of the fact that Parliament deserves to have the opinion of the Commission on all the amendments which have been tabled, I see that I have been speaking for 24 minutes. I have some replies to question put to me during the debate but I fear that would take me far beyond the time allotted so I really am in your hands as to what you want me to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To change that approach would in particular prevent or, at the very least, greatly hamper use of turnkey projects, public/private partnerships, works concessions and competitive dialogues. The Commission is, therefore, opposed to imposing a separation between the design and the execution of works.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Schörling, the Commission has proposed including as possible award criterion the environmental characteristics of a product or service, provided that they present an advantage to the contracting authority. That criterion allows a public purchaser to evaluate the intrinsic qualities of the product or service and to award contracts to the most economically advantageous tender. The proposed amendments go further, in allowing more general environmental considerations such as the long-term effects on the environment of the products or services purchased to be taken into account at the award stage. Such considerations are not measurable; they cannot assist in an evaluation of the intrinsic qualities of the product or services and are therefore inappropriate at the award stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Rapkay and Mr Hughes, the purpose of the public procurement directives is to coordinate the procedures for the award of contracts and not to state which obligations – social or otherwise – private contractors must comply with once a contract is awarded. Contractors are in any event required to comply with all applicable laws and obligations, whether social in nature or not.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is willing to state in the recitals of the directives that tenderers must comply with applicable social rules, including collective agreements of general application in performing public procurement contracts. The Commission also agrees that contracting authorities should be required to state in the contract documents the body from which information on applicable social obligations can be obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Hautala, I should like to say that regarding the preliminary reference currently before the Court of Justice, the Commission has taken note of the conclusions of the Advocate-General. However, those conclusions cannot prejudge the judgment itself. In addition, having regard to the content of the communication on the environment and public contracts, the Commission – as it explained at the time of the Court hearing – does not see an obstacle to the emissions criterion being taken into account where this involves – as the case of the city of Helsinki has shown – an external cost to the purchaser itself. The Commission will, therefore, wait for the Court's ruling and reconsider interpretation in the light of the judgment and, if necessary, will consider revising its position on the amendments from the European Parliament.</p>

May I therefore say that if Mr Lehne had been present I would have said the following – and I am, of course, willing say it even though Mr Lehne is not here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne stated that social and environmental clauses must be introduced in the tender documents themselves and should not influence the choice at the award stage. Therefore, I would support his view that Article 53 on award criteria should not be modified. Such considerations may be taken into account at the appropriate stage, either in the tender documents or in the contractual clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot support Amendment No 147 by Mr Zappalà, since it will not provide any legal certainty to economic operators.</p>
<p class="contents">May I end my reply to Parliament here and conclude by saying that there is now a real need to ensure that our public procurement rules remain relevant to increasingly sophisticated procurement requirements. That is why Parliament and the Council must now press ahead to ensure that these directives are adopted at the earliest opportunity.</p>

In any case, I would like to thank him for all his comments, which were certainly important from my point of view, although I do maintain – and I will do so tomorrow – that Parliament should have the autonomy to decide on a political basis rather than on the basis of other factors. However, his response regarding Amendment No 147 does not make sense at all: while the Commission is against raising the thresholds – which, as was said during the hearings, meetings and debates within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I believe is because it wants the directives on works contracts to be applied as widely as possible – according to what the Commissioner has just said, raising the thresholds would actually reduce the number of works contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Now then, Amendment No 147 seeks specifically to open up works contracts to competition, and I cannot understand why the Commission is opposed to this. I would be grateful to the Commissioner if, either now or later in private, by some means or other, he could explain to me what part of Amendment No 147 is unacceptable. It is important, Mr President, for this is no trivial matter. I repeat, if it is not appropriate to do so now because it is time to suspend our work or move on to something else, I am quite prepared, if the Commissioner agrees, even to meet him afterwards so that he can explain to me what is wrong with Amendment No 147, which, as I see it, ensures that absolutely all works contracts, of whatever type, can be governed by European legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until 1971 the only rules and principles applicable to public procurement were those enshrined in the Treaty itself, and in particular the provisions of Articles 28 and 49. However, experience has shown that the genuine opening up of markets and the creation of a real and efficient internal market required that those rules and principles be clarified through detailed provisions coordinating national procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">To revert to the legal situation of the 1970s – and this would be the result of the proposal just made and enshrined in Amendment No 147 – is not acceptable, especially in a proposal aimed at modernising the legislation. Moreover, to do so would also deprive economic operators of one of the most important advances in the field of public procurement, namely the possibility of enforcing their rights through efficient legal remedies guaranteed through the two specific directives which govern remedies in respect of contracts falling within the scope of the public procurement directives. Therefore, the introduction of Amendment No 147 simply does not make the amendments aimed at raising thresholds throughout the directive acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
