I actually think that, in this case, there is scope for the exercise of political will to a degree that there is not in the case of earthquakes and tsunamis, in the face of which we are fairly powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are a few figures. According to the World Health Organisation, of the million deaths attributable to malaria, 200 000 are apparently due to the counterfeiting or poor administration of medicines. The well-known British journal, <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, attributes 192 000 deaths in China to the taking of counterfeit medicines. How many hopes are ruined by the use of these medicines? The necessary moral basis for justifying firm political action is given to us by this state of affairs, which can in no way be compared with the counterfeiting of luxury goods. I am thinking of products such as handbags, ballpoint pens, cigarette lighters and spectacles, the counterfeiting of which naturally requires the active complicity of the purchaser, who knows what he is buying and pretty rarely allows himself to be deceived. The counterfeiting of medicines is the most amoral of all forms of counterfeiting as, of course, there is no complicity at all in the purchase on the part of the buyer, who gets into debt only to end up killing his children.</p>
<p class="contents">In this particular case, the Food and Drug Administration and the WHO believe that 10% of the world market is affected by counterfeiting. Seventy per cent of anti-malaria drugs in seven African countries are counterfeit medicines. On average, 25% of medicines taken in the least advanced countries – 50% in the case of Pakistan and Nigeria – are counterfeit medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we talking about? I quote the WHO’s definition. A counterfeit medicine is one that is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity or source. The medicine concerned may be either patented or a generic product. Some counterfeit products contain good ingredients and others bad ones or, indeed, no active ingredient at all. There are others that do not contain enough of the active ingredient and whose packaging is misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being done? Little or nothing! As I said, people are deceived, sometimes with their own consent; but if they kill, it is always without wanting to. We, here in the European Union, are in a protected environment. We have an efficient health system. Our health professions are monitored. The state keeps an eye on things and monitors society. We need, however, to do something for those countries that do not have all our advantages. That is a duty on the part of the Union, whose honour is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">The world is, in fact, unprotected. There is little specific legislation, either international or national. Borders are extremely porous. There is a proliferation of modern distribution systems such as the Internet. There are few or no authorities to regulate and monitor product quality. Distribution systems are archaic and unsupervised, and there is no distinguishing between counterfeited and protected brands. Let us make no mistake. It is not a bunch of naive amateurs we are dealing with here. We are dealing with a very well organised underworld, as the counterfeiting of medicines is less risky and more lucrative than drug trafficking. We therefore need to pull out all the stops and take tough action right across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask that the European Union adopt a major role in drawing up an International Convention to combat counterfeiting at every stage. That is also the burden of written declaration no. 53, which I would encourage my fellow Members to sign.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of 2006, the WHO has set up a working party to perfect model legislation for tackling counterfeiting – legislation that might then be adopted by each Member State. We in the European Union have the political means to take the lead, thanks to our network of partners and to the intellectual input, political support and financial backing of the bodies responsible for the supervision that we shall be able to exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have all the means required for taking action. We have a wide range of partners. We have the amount of necessary aid – need it be pointed out that we are the world’s biggest aid donor and that just a tiny portion of this aid would enable us to solve the problem? We also have the legal machinery and the means of putting pressure on the main actors, which need to be the WHO and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to be sentimental, but who cannot but think of a mother mourning her child in the belief that she had given him the medicine that would save him. Imagine there being just one similar case in Europe and what our media would make of it. There are cases like this on a daily basis in the least advanced countries. We are not in the sphere of magic and of miracle cures. This is sordid reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform you, Commissioner, that, on behalf of the European Parliament and with the help of my fellow Members, I shall exercise my right to follow up this matter. In a year’s time, I shall question you again to see what has been done. There should be no let-up in fighting this war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question rightly mentions three problem areas. The first is the fight against counterfeit medicines within the European Union. The Commission is taking action on this at two levels.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have of course reinforced legal protection. In 2004, new legislation was adopted on the protection of intellectual property, and 2003 and 2004 saw the adoption of new legislation on customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights. Discussions are currently being held on two proposals on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent study in the Community revealed that, within the European Union in the last five years, 27 counterfeit medicines have turned up in legal distribution channels and 170 in illegal distribution channels. On the basis of these findings, the Member States are currently developing measures to combat this counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission, together with the Member States, the European Medicines Agency and international partners, is investigating what measures will be necessary in future to protect public health. The issues being considered in this regard include the enforcement of existing legislation, cooperation between the various authorities, and also communication and awareness-raising. Nor do I exclude the possibility that the existing legislation will have to be further developed, and that we shall have to consider amending it.</p>
<p class="contents">More effective customs controls are an important instrument for curbing the trade in counterfeit medicines. I am pleased to say that the quantity of counterfeit medicines seized by customs is already increasing. The Commission communication on a customs response to latest trends in counterfeiting and piracy that was issued recently addresses the problem of counterfeit medicines, and recommends specific measures to combat this growing threat.</p>
<p class="contents">In the experience of the customs authorities, a large proportion of the counterfeits are transported through the EU and are often destined for developing countries. The fight against imported counterfeits is particularly difficult in that they often enter the EU in small quantities, and customs authorities have to detect the illegal goods in a very large number of small consignments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission encourages right holders to take full advantage of the protection afforded by Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003. On their application for action by customs, right holders supply the information the customs authorities need in order to perform a targeted search for the highest-risk consignments.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area concerns the issue of what we are doing for the poorer countries, which are actually the main victims of these counterfeit medicines. What are we doing to help them regulate and monitor the quality of medicines in their own territory?</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of principle, we of course endeavour to work at multilateral level. The Commission therefore supports the initiatives of the World Health Organization to combat counterfeit medicines. The WHO Conference held in Rome in February 2006 created a platform for specific action. Accordingly, the Commission supports the launching of a WHO taskforce to combat counterfeit medicines at international level. The results of the work of this taskforce will benefit all WHO members, including developing countries. The Commission will play an active part in this taskforce and provide the necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is carrying out projects supported by the European Development Fund, particularly the EC-WHO partnership on pharmaceutical policies. This partnership is intended to enable ACP countries to render more effective their legislation and quality assurance systems for medicines, and to improve aspects such as their controls, their action against substandard or counterfeit medicines and their information management. EUR 2.3 million have been provided for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the idea of an international convention against counterfeit medicines. The idea of such a convention was discussed in detail in the course of preparations for the February 2006 WHO Conference and at the conference itself. Most participants, including the Commission, were of the opinion that an international convention is not, at present, the most effective means of combating the growing threat from counterfeit medicines. The taskforce set up at the conference is in a better position to gather and pass on information and work out the urgently needed solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I reassure the House that the Commission shares Parliament’s concerns and is prepared to take up suggestions and take further initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Counterfeit medicines are manufactured and traded illegally without any form of supervision. Their effects cannot be checked, which makes them a potential risk to public health, and so this piracy should be stopped. Mr Cornillet already broached the subject, the Commissioner mentioned it as well and I welcome every measure the Commission takes to tackle this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Since problems mainly occur in the developing countries, the poor countries, that is also where I can foresee the biggest problems when it comes to dealing with this piracy efficiently and adequately. In those countries, the supply of reliable, legal medicines is often not organised as well as it is in Europe. That is why traders in counterfeit medicines have relatively more scope to sell their medicines, the effect of which cannot be checked and can, consequently, even be harmful to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, developing countries often lack an adequate legal framework. Their laws are simply not adequate to the task of addressing this problem effectively. Even when these are in place, monitoring leaves a great deal to be desired. In developing countries, there is a need for affordable, effective and, of course, legal medicines, and that is why I should like to mention the scope which generic medicines offer. They cannot make the problem go away, but can go some way towards alleviating the need that exists. Unfortunately, little use is being made of them at the moment. More could be done perhaps in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner claimed that an international convention or standard is not enough, but I can well imagine that one could make a difference, and if it proves inadequate, then more should be done. I take the view that a clear and universal approach is extremely important. Europe will need to do its bit, and that also involves the transfer of knowledge, in order to address the fight against counterfeit medicines more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know – and the Commissioner has already partly answered in his explanation – what the new plans are for tackling counterfeit medicines and the organisation in this respect, particularly where criminal activity is concerned, in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the start of his speech, he gave the World Health Organization’s definition of what is to be understood by counterfeiting of medicines. I think that this is very important, as the discussion of this issue could easily become sidetracked, with many of us believing it was about saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to generic medicines. By giving this definition and through his stance, he made it clear that counterfeiting can affect both patented and generic medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been said already, in developed countries it is predominantly so-called lifestyle drugs that are counterfeited, and no doubt we all have our own tales of deleting thousands of spam e-mails offering medicines at low to very low prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing countries, medicines intended to treat diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids are being counterfeited. Sometimes counterfeit medicines for simple illnesses such as coughs can even cause umpteen deaths, as they have had toxic chemicals added that are normally used in products such as antifreeze. According to the World Health Organization, 30 people died in Cambodia in 1999 after taking counterfeit malaria medicines. There is a whole list of tragic cases such as these and, in addition, there are probably many cases going unreported, as it is not possible to compile statistics on the problem of these criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem affects all regions of the world, but developing countries of course bear the brunt of the damage. Once again, the reasons are poverty and lack of access to health services. When people cannot afford the medicines they need, they will try to obtain them unofficially at lower prices. For this reason, it is impossible to combat this phenomenon properly without effective health services or affordable medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures to enhance intellectual property rights are good and are suitable as part of the strategy, but do not tackle the problem at its roots.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important – and I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for stating this so resolutely and specifically – that we assist the countries concerned in building their capacities for producing safe medicines in, and importing safe medicines into, their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all of one mind in saying that pirate medicines – and I am in complete agreement with what Mr Cornillet has stated – are a scourge that kills, above all, of course, in the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this potentially lethal counterfeiting is not widely known about and, in the majority of cases, goes almost unremarked. We are a long way here from the spectacular legal actions – recipients of much media attention – that have been brought by the manufacturers of luxury products and that, in a number of cases, have also been transferred to higher courts – actions that, it has also to be noted, have not met with much success.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to antibiotics, the Pill, steroids, powdered milk for babies, anti-malaria drugs – which have already been talked about – vaccines – a counterfeit Tamiflu, for example – and Viagra too, the counterfeit medicines industry is quite amoral in the way it copies everything, since this is done without the consumer’s knowledge. Mr Cornillet quoted a whole range of revealing figures. I noted the EUR 25 billion per year represented by this traffic. Worldwide, one antibiotic in three and one medicine in ten are counterfeit.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above the damage to the economy obviously represented by these figures, the big issue here is the disastrous impact of this counterfeiting in terms of health. At best, these counterfeit medicines are ineffective. At worst – as I said – they kill, especially when it is a question of medicines used in the case of mortal diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS. In China alone, the hub and empire of counterfeiting of every kind, 200 000 people were dying each year after having been treated with pirated medicines, including in a number of hospitals administered by the Chinese Red Cross.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the observations that can be made. As for the causes, these are known, at least in part. Mr Cornillet referred to them at length: the absence, still scarcely remedied, of any real will on the part of national governments to combat this scourge; the absence, too, in many countries of legislation that might genuinely act as a deterrent; the ridiculously low cost of these counterfeit medicines; and, above all, the poverty to be found in the countries concerned and the fact that the most vulnerable population groups, which are crying out for accessible medicines, find it impossible to gain access to health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In a debate such as this, no one claims to have the solution, or at least a ready-made one, but a responsible policy needs to be proposed, given the urgency of the situation. In April, while denouncing all forms of counterfeiting before this Assembly, Commissioner Frattini took a tougher stance in terms of sanctions against Europeans and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must take the lead and, in close cooperation with the WHO, put a global strategy in place to combat this scourge effectively. Certainly, judicial and police coordination needs to be set up and sanctions put in place, but people also need to be informed and, above all, warned. Today, the difficulty consists in making essential high quality medicines available to the whole populations in the countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It might therefore be hoped that our fellow Member’s timely question will finally lead to some results.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, the main motive for counterfeiting medicines has to do with the fact that they are much too highly priced for poor countries and their populations. The first tactic should therefore consist in ensuring that poor countries and the most impoverished populations have access to generic medicines. This is something that my fellow Member has spoken about. Generic medicines still do not have a significant enough place on the medicines market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would not want the fight against counterfeiting to consist in reinforcing the protection of patents in the pharmaceutical sphere and so protecting the future development of the already considerable profits made by the pharmaceutical industry in many sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority is, therefore, to encourage the development of public health policies in the countries concerned, as well as to encourage the establishment of states governed by the rule of law. That is indeed the priority. Nothing is possible unless viable states and public health policies are established enabling, in particular, medicines to be monitored and pharmacies to be set up in accordance with properly laid down rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue of a public health policy is one basic element, the other being prevention. Indeed, health is not just about medicines. In other words, swallowing medicines is not the only route to good health. For example, unclean drinking water is at present a cause of death in a number of developing countries. Another example relates to AIDS. The counterfeiting of medicines is highly developed in this area, and the recently held Onusida conference placed great emphasis on prevention. It is therefore also through policies of prevention, information and education and by relying on the practical knowledge present in local communities that attempts might be made to solve the problem and not merely through putting dozens of substances on the market at prohibitive prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that, in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to begin by strengthening existing measures and coordinating them better. Then, we must above all help the developing, or poorest, countries to establish viable states and to put public policies in place covering all health problems and not only that of access to medicines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
