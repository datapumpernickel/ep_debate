<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fava (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no hesitation in defining as a historical step the approval of this regulation on the Single Sky, which is the work of myself and my colleague Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, and of many Members who have contributed over the last two years to make this a fundamental commitment for our Parliament. I consider it important because it allows us to extend our philosophy, our challenge to also see European integration in our skies, and it enables us to attain two fundamental objectives: the first, immediate aim, is to create an integrated air space, governed by the same rules, the same guarantees; second, it also enables us to review the concept of sovereignty in order to adapt it more completely to the process of European integration in which we are currently investing our energy and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The first objective that this regulation has certainly achieved is that of safety. A report drawn up a few days ago lists the last 18 air incidents, the last 18 major air disasters recorded since 11 September 2001: we have calculated the total number of deaths at 2300. Not one of these disasters is linked to terrorist acts; they are air disasters linked to problems concerned with flight safety. So, in this sense our regulation makes a fundamental contribution. If air traffic grows at the same rate at which it has grown in recent years and if we do not take steps in relation to safety, as we are seeking to do with this regulation, then in the year 2015 – according to forecasts – we will have a disaster of this scale every week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Single Sky is a fundamental contribution, a contribution that also seeks to have spin-offs in terms of organisation, efficiency and good sense. Currently in Europe there are 41 different air traffic control centres, each often having its own rules, with its own flight paths, its own corridors, its own flight quotas. From Rome to Brussels one passes through the hands of seven different flight control centres, and handovers are not always smooth: consider what happened over Lake Constance a few years ago when as a result of a misunderstanding between two flight control centres during a handover an aeroplane crashed to the ground. As a result of this regulation safety will once again become the priority of European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority the regulation would appear to have established concerns costs and timetables. The growth of European traffic will take us from seven million flights in 1997 to twelve million flights by 2010, and today one in five flights experiences more than 20 minutes delay. It is clear that efficiency in terms of timetables and costs makes our companies competitive in the market: the US has more or less the same geographical area as Europe, but they have double the number of aeroplanes in the air and much shorter delays. How have we attempted to deal with these points and these issues? We did so with the committed and knowledgeable support of the Commission, represented by the Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio, and with the good sense shown by the Council in this difficult conciliation phase.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three points I want to touch on briefly: the first naturally concerns civil-military cooperation. In the compromise finally reached it was decided that explicit reference should be made to the statement of the Member States on military matters. In that statement the Member States acknowledge that air space can be used in a safe and efficient manner only if there is close cooperation between civil and military authorities. We consider it a milestone in the process of European integration: for the first time the military top brass of all fifteen European countries understand that the European skies are not anyone’s property and that a balance must be struck – at the highest possible level in terms of quality – between the defence requirements of all Member States and the safety requirements that are the main concern of the customers, that is to say European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is the role played by Eurocontrol. We have attempted to take on board and make good use of, in terms of experience and efficiency, what Eurocontrol stands for and the role it could play in constructing this integrated European single space. To achieve that goal required cooperation whilst avoiding the duplication of roles and functions; cooperation with the European Institutions and the Commission is a must for this regulation. It has been established that Eurocontrol will be able to participate as an observer in the meetings of the Committee on the Single Sky; we are therefore moving towards a major stage in the contribution that Eurocontrol will be able to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, provision has been made for sanctions, at Parliament’s request, on the basis of an elementary principle taught us by Beccaria: without sanctions, without the threat of sanctions, it is difficult for any legal principles to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that the merit of this regulation – and of the European Institutions that have contributed to its achievement – lies in having again overcome certain national concerns and egoistic considerations. A European Single Sky from 1 January 2005 will provide clear confirmation that Europe is growing, that the process of integration is developing and that that process is also synonymous with the quality and safety of our lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sanders-ten Holte (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as the elections approach, I am increasingly being asked whether Parliament actually amounts to anything, and whether it really does have anything to say. I think that this dossier is a case in point, and I shall discuss this in more detail. The Council and the Commission initially had very great ambitions, particularly after 11 September, but these gradually evaporated. There were all kinds of sensitivities regarding sovereignty and legal hurdles; in short, the Council did not dare to make a bold move, and Parliament clearly took a different perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a clear aim, which is increased integration in European airspace in the interests of the citizen. That is necessary, and, in consultation with the Council, we finally obtained a clear commitment on their part to achieve that aim, too. This is a first step in the right direction. The main points that we agreed with the Council in conciliation were on the subject of implementation, of course. Service providers must comply with stringent requirements, and this compliance must be monitored. Conflicts of interests must be eliminated, and access to services must be guaranteed for all airspace users: including military, I should like to add. I think that it is important for that to be pursued by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reached agreement on the charging regimes. Incentives can be used to promote a better use of airspace. There must be a decrease in subsidies, and, furthermore, everything must be made more transparent. We have also pushed for clarity as regards the future. When shall we see legislation regarding the licensing of air-traffic controllers? At what point might the concepts of the Single Sky in the upper airspace also be applicable to lower airspace? We should like some certainty on those points. In addition, we think it is a good thing that Eurocontrol has become involved with this; it has worked very hard on this, and indeed I believe that the discussion on this dossier has focused everyone’s attention, which is all to the good.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which there was a difference of opinion was, of course, civil-military cooperation. I think Mr Fava’s greatest achievement was to succeed in securing the inclusion in the text of a clear reference to the need for this kind of cooperation. Parliament is committed to this, and emphasised it continually in the course of the negotiations. Indeed, this could perhaps be a stepping-stone to more and better military cooperation in the future. We in this House also succeeded in making clear the importance of data exchange; again, that applies to all – including military – service providers. We are also pleased that the Member States have committed themselves to cooperating on the concept of the flexible use of airspace across national borders: that will prevent many delays. Mr Fava has already discussed this in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the point on which conciliation nearly foundered: cross-border airspace blocks. I think that we have reached a reasonable compromise in the form of Article 5(6). Speaking personally, I think this was one of the most important points, because, if progress is to be made, provision for conflict mediation has to be included in the text, otherwise it is all too easy to hide behind someone else. Having invested a great deal of effort in this on behalf of my colleagues, I am fairly pleased with the outcome. The Member States are obliged to take the views of the Commission into consideration, and they must also take those views as the basis for resolving conflicts over the creation of cross-border airspace blocks. What helped win us over was the Commission’s pledge, in the form of a written statement, to take action to review the procedure after five years if no clear progress has been made with the reorganisation of the airspace. This provides the impetus that is vital in order to make European airspace safer and more efficient. This is important for service providers, airspace users, and, of course, passengers. It is also essential in view of the current increase in air traffic of more than 2% per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you can be assured that the European Parliament has acted in the interests of the citizen and that we shall closely monitor the progress made and take action if the Member States are found wanting.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation and the services for their support. Negotiations with the Council may well have been tough, but they were also congenial and constructive throughout, with each party understanding the other’s views; and that is the way it should be, too. It has been an honour to do my share towards making air transport safer and more efficient in the interests of the citizen. I should also like to take this opportunity to point out how important the role of the European Parliament has been, because I think that, together with the Council, we have achieved a very good proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pleasure to be able to attend this debate which is going to represent the positive conclusion and therefore the approval of what has been one of this Commission’s priorities and, of course, one of my priorities, as Commissioner responsible for transport: the implementation of the Single European Sky.</p>
<p class="contents">The work we have been doing has been hard and complicated, and we have therefore been working for some years. In relation to this initiative, for the first time, dressed in uniform, military aviation chiefs from all the Member States of the Union, together with civilian chiefs, met on the premises of the European institutions – and specifically the Commission’s premises – in order to discuss certain aspects which have been pointed out by the rapporteurs, such as the flexible civilian and military use of European airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an initiative for which the support of Parliament, and in particular that of Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has been the key to being able to promote it and bring it to light.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political groups and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their support during the many discussions we have held.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that an initiative which, at the time we launched it, met with great scepticism from the Member States of the Union, which was fiercely opposed by certain sectors, is in the end going to enjoy generalised support.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that all the Member States support this initiative and they demonstrated this with the adoption of the latest decisions within the Council, and I hope that in today’s vote this will also be the case. I would also point out that the various sectors of the industry in question (air navigation service providers, airlines, manufacturers of equipment, airports ...) are aware of the opportunity offered by this initiative, an opportunity to promote a market with greater dimensions, greater capacities and, above all, which is going to allow us to be leaders and work on the definition of new concepts of air navigation and air traffic control with a view to the STAR 21 initiative for 2020 and also participate, cooperate and combine proposals with those of the United States in order to promote a safer system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fava insisted on the safety aspect, which is a key element of this initiative, safer systems for the future but with a more appropriate technology which allows better, safer and more efficient use of the airspace and I would insist that all of this is going to lead to greater safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something which is also extremely important, and that is that the unions, in particular those which represent the key actors in this field, such as air traffic controllers, have in the end been appreciating the advantages of an initiative of this type and in this regard I am pleased with the joint statement which unions and employers have issued on the final text agreed, a final text within which Eurocontrol one of the key elements which was involved in the discussion also finds its role and responsibility as a body with experience and knowledge which is absolutely essential to the development of the Single European Sky.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that some people have doubted the willingness of the States in relation to specific aspects and, just today, the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has indicated that we are going to closely monitor how the States of the Union develop in terms of the implementation of this Single European Sky.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the text we have finally agreed on is a balanced text, a balanced text which will certainly evolve in the future, but we must be aware that we are carrying out a genuine revolution and an extremely important step forward in the construction of Europe in a real sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion that there is sovereignty over airspace, an area in which we are going to regulate and act according to common rules within an integrated system is a tremendous step forward which we cannot underestimate, and therefore, the fact that the Member States maintain – as reflected in the text which we have finally agreed on – the guarantees necessary to accept this change, seems to me to be the appropriate compensation if we want to continue taking steps forward in the knowledge that Europe cannot be built in one day, but that it is a process within which we must continue to make progress on the basis of consensus with the support of all the States, because it is not a question of leaving anybody behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I know there are still things to do – and I would insist: over the coming years there will be new proposals – but I believe that today we are opening up new possibilities which mean taking maximum advantage of the prospects offered by our very membership of this group known as the European Union, in other words, taking advantage of European added value. And that is what we are doing today in order to create an airspace which can be managed more efficiently but, above all, more safely, in a manner which respects the environment, at the service of the citizens, and which represents, I would insist, a step forward which, in certain respects, is almost revolutionary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Council for its position which has allowed us to develop in this way throughout these discussions over all these years – the first meeting took place in January 2000, it was one of the first things I did – four years during which we have all been able to develop and come together in relation to rules which allow us to introduce this initiative which, I would remind the honourable Members, will also affect Swiss airspace and Norwegian airspace. Furthermore, Switzerland and Norway have participated fully in the discussions we have held over all this time and, once again, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all the Members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Parliament and the Council for their contributions which have undoubtedly improved the final result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think they have fought splendidly and with commitment, particularly in the final stage, when one sometimes got the impression that only Parliament was left to carry on the fight on this issue, the Commission having thrown in the towel a while back. According to the splendid brochure that was issued in 2002 with a foreword by the Commissioner, ‘the time is ripe’. Then along came the many proposals that, alas, never seem quite to have taken legal effect. It is for that reason that I am a bit wary today of talking in terms of a historic moment or of a culmination. This is at best a start.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us have no illusions; this is the third time that this House has discussed this topic, and if the public could listen in, they would find it utterly beyond belief, believing as they do that this ought to have been sorted out ages ago. On the ground, we have no borders any more; I can get in the car and drive from Berlin to Paris or from Paris to Rome without undergoing checks. Despite the compelling arguments in favour of its doing so, this situation does not, however, apply in the skies above us, where aircraft fly over borders on a day-to day basis. What is so comic about all this is the lamentable fact that the Council, in March 2002, when it met in Barcelona, came out with an explicit statement, noted a need, and made a demand to the effect that ‘we need a single European sky’, and it was the Council that stonewalled wherever it could, right up to the very end. I put this in such blunt terms simply because I have for a long time been considering whether I can at all vote in favour of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As we saw it, there were two central points, the two big issues. We wanted greater safety, and we wanted more efficiency in the air. We were aware that the two were closely interconnected, and that, on the one hand, collaboration and cooperation between civil and military aviation had to be organised, whilst, on the other, we must put an end to fragmentation once and for all. As the brochure so splendidly put it, the patchwork had to become a network. As Mr Fava put it, the fact that there are 41 air traffic control centres in the Member States alone, with a short flight from Brussels to Rome having to pass through seven of them, not only makes for potential dangers, but also provides reasons for unnecessary delays. The Council has spent a long time blocking these central points.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret having to tell you, Commissioner, that, when the Common Position came back to the committee, it was your representatives who said that the Council may well have taken a conservative position, but that was the only big success we were going to get. If Parliament had not stood so firm, and if the two rapporteurs had not given their all, it would not have been possible to achieve what is at least a beginning, with some degree of cooperation, an agreement, an understanding, a shared conversation between all the users. Nor, moreover, would there have been the clear instruction to the Member States – who, let us recall, have had decades in which to create functional airspace blocks – combined with the declaration, which I saw as crucial, that if nothing changes in the next five years, we must and will make improvements, in which event we cannot allow the Member States to retain competence in this matter. With this in mind – for this was what I saw as essential – I said it would be better to have a bird in the hand at the moment and to make a start, for there was nothing else on offer. Let me make it quite clear, though, that I have not lost sight of the two birds in the bush, and I would ask that all of us in this European Parliament should continue to keep on working hard so that this single airspace in Europe should not be merely a vision, but should indeed, one day, become reality. We need it – whether we get it with the Member States or despite them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you once shared with us a vision of how we would in future be able to fly directly from A to B within Europe, thus enabling much better use to be made of capacity, reducing delays to a marked degree, radically minimising safety risks by, in short order, creating a few functional airspace blocks in Europe, and putting an end to the patchwork in the skies above Europe. What we have ended up with is a sort of ‘Single Sky <span class="italic">lite</span>’. Politically speaking, it is clear, nothing more could be achieved, and agreement between the Council and Parliament was reached only at the very last minute – quite literally, at five minutes to twelve.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is the overall result that matters to us, Parliament has moved a long way and has acceded to many of the Council’s wishes and concerns. It has to be said that the Council of Ministers gave us the distinct impression that the national point of view continued to predominate – and that impression remains. The result is that we have flown in the right direction but have landed well short of the runway. Particularly where military-civilian cooperation is concerned, Parliament had to be very careful of national sensitivities and was in fact obliged to abandon the concept of flexible use of airspace. Substantial areas of airspace continue to be barred to any but military traffic. While a direct flight from Rome to Brussels has presented no problems in navigational terms for some time now, it will not be possible in future, which is economic and environmental nonsense. We have in any case made progress in that the Member States have, for the first time, acknowledged that the only way to ensure the safe and efficient use of airspace is for the military and civilian users of it to cooperate, irrespective of how this is to be arranged in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, though, do other than agree with Mr Fava when I say that, as regards the functional airspace blocks, which are at the heart of the Single Sky, the result was less than what the facts of the situation demanded, for a real Community solution would have been needed, with the Commission having clear decision-making competence. That, unfortunately, is something we could not get accepted; here too, the Member States still have the last word, but decisive progress has been made in that they are, for the first time, obliged to negotiate about the establishment of cross-border airspace blocks. Moreover, the Commission is to closely monitor developments, review the situation after five years and propose any changes that may be needed to the system; like Mr Schmitt, I hope that it will. To put it in plain language, the Member States can no longer evade their responsibilities, as they did over past decades, now that they are under close observation, and both Parliament and the Commission expect great things of them. To sum up, the outcome may well not be the quantum leap in air transport that we had hoped for and that had been heralded, but we have started to stake out the ground and can look forward to more Europe above the clouds in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the integration of lower airspace that is being contemplated and – if I may go one step further – the creation of a single trans-European airspace, I hope that the topic of flexible airspace use and, of course, of functional airspace blocks can again ...</p>

On behalf of my group, I abstained on this agreement, but I support the steps forward made from the initial draft.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, after various air disasters, the issue of safety remains the priority for any approach in this field. Therefore, from the start I looked at these reports mainly from the point of view of safety. I had expressed my regret in this House regarding the ideological bias that was placing liberalisation at the heart of the measures proposed. It was a bias that was aiming to make economic issues the regulator for air activity and the main method of improving things. In my view, the agreement reached now has a much more realistic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between civilian and military air traffic will be promoted, insofar as it is compatible with the sovereignty of the Member States, even though I would have hoped for a more dynamic approach in this area. The airspace blocks will be based on operational or functional requirements, irrespective of national borders, in consultation with Eurocontrol. In the event of a dispute, the Member States will, if they wish, be able to jointly request the opinion of a Single Sky Committee, the body responsible for implementing the plan. Chaired by the representative of the Commission, this committee will be made up of two representatives of each Member State and a representative of Eurocontrol. The agreement allows the Member States the freedom to entrust air monitoring to a public service or a private company. I see these proposals as positive developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is not the initial plan to dismantle the chain of so-called ancillary services, I nevertheless regret the fact that it was not more clearly recognised that the management of air navigation safety is a chain of actions and services that requires a global approach rather than a piecemeal one. I still regret the fact that Parliament did not wish to retain the amendment that I had tabled on behalf of my group aimed at doubling monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure that operations continue in complete security in the event of a fault.</p>
<p class="contents">I still think that the absolute rule of obligatory separation of functions between the service providers and the national monitoring authorities does not necessarily take into account the complex realities of decisions in sectors that are so inter-related. I also think that the issue of air traffic control and of everything involved with the regulation and safety of air traffic are tasks that are the responsibility of the public authorities, who should be considered as public services. I have met the operators. I have worked a great deal with the unions on this matter. I wish to thank them and say that their contributions counted towards the positive progress that we have made. I also think that in the future, the points of view of the main people involved, the employees, should be better taken into account. This is one of the conditions necessary in order for other improvements to be made and also for the measures that will be taken in Europe to be effective. You can be sure that my group is determined to contribute to this. This is the reasoning for my vote, aiming to both take into account the progress made and show how much there is left to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank them for their dedication to bringing common interests to the fore. It is clear, after all, that the whole political spectrum in this House advocates greater European powers in order to better guarantee safety. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that our national governments will have to be accountable. If an accident should happen, this would be owing to our continuing strong adherence to national lines, and so countries would have to answer to their own citizens regarding the lack of a genuine Single Sky. We often parade the principle of subsidiarity, of which I am a great supporter, but that subsidiarity must also apply from the bottom up. If this is necessary for the sake of the safety of air transport, the national authorities must be prepared to hand over power to the European Union. Anything else would be irresponsible. I recently had a conversation with the federal authorities of the United States, where no fewer than 48 000 people are engaged in monitoring air transport safety under a single federal umbrella. In my opinion, the degree of safety must not be subordinate to our great predilection for diversity. If there is one place where diversity should not apply, that is in matters of safety monitoring. For that reason, we agree with you that we are taking a step forward with the Single Sky today, but we could actually have taken this step as long as 20 years ago, and we should have been able to go much further today than we have now gone.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we are not blind to the improvements that have been made in the arrangements discussed during the negotiations. Nevertheless, we should like to emphasise that accidents of this kind, such as the one near Lake Constance, give us a further impetus to go over to those cross-border<span class="italic"> </span>airspace blocks, in order to preclude the possibility of even more accidents of this kind occurring as a result of poor communications.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the improvement that we have here is still insufficient. After all, if we look at the way in which the civilian and military spheres are already cooperating on interoperability to a certain degree for the benefit of safety, we see that the concept of national sovereignty is invoked much too often there, and that could be detrimental to safety. That is a priority for this entire Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand the reasons for their reactions; however, if they themselves go back a bit, six or seven years back, and look at where we were then, they will see that we have before us a very important step, a very important step for Europe, a very important step for the European citizens. As you too, Mr President, were personally involved in the conciliation procedure, you will understand, I think, better than anyone, that a very important step is being taken in the field of restricting delays and, consequently, in this manner we are strengthening air transport, protecting the environment better and efficiently supporting European tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Right until the end, we were faced with prejudices either on the part of certain Member States or certain military authorities. You know that, up to the last minute, there was a problem as regards cooperation between military and civil authorities, on the one hand, and there was a problem as regards the way in which single operating sections or blocks are defined at international level. Some steps were taken under pressure from the European Parliament. Perhaps the steps were not taken which should have been taken. Nonetheless, it is better for the European Parliament to agree to what we have before us and to look on it as a first step. Our efforts must not stop here. It is worth our putting even greater pressure on the Member States to become more bold in their approach and, I think, to close my short position, within these frameworks, it would be an oversight if we failed to mention the exceptionally positive role of the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, for whom I imagine it is perhaps one of the greatest achievements which she has had in her term of office to date as the Commissioner responsible for transport. We must thank her and congratulate her on that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would simply like to say that, as we saw with the Lake Constance disaster, the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and those of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, whenever there is an accident people look to Europe. And generally speaking the very people who are against European integration forget they were against it when tragedies happen. I therefore believe that the creation of the single sky bodes well for the future. At any rate, in this integrated European area we ought to do for the sky what we have done for roads and what we are trying to do for shipping and the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in this matter Parliament’s role was quite decisive in getting the general interest and public service nature of air traffic control recognised. Conversely, I think that air traffic control personnel have gained a European dimension that will make them think differently in future and probably play a more active part in the next stages of the single European sky. I am pleased about all that and I think this text is at last integrated and that this evening we have good reason to be pleased with the result we have achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Behind the term ‘single sky’ is the race to privatise the old national carriers. This policy has already resulted in thousands of redundancies in the aeronautical sector. At this very moment, massive redundancies have been announced or are under way at Alitalia, at KLM, which is controlled by Air France, and in other large airlines. It is obvious what the privatised airlines’ shareholders have to gain from the reduction in personnel, not only flight staff, but also those involved in maintenance and safety checks. But this profit-driven approach means that passengers are running growing risks.</p>
<p class="contents">To continue with this policy after the Lake Constance disaster 18 months ago, which was a direct consequence of the privatisation of air traffic control in Switzerland, is criminal. As for the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster, even if the precise technical cause is not yet known, everyone knows that the airlines, including the one that owned that aircraft, make their profits by turning their aircraft round more quickly, extending their flying time, taking on staff who are less well paid and often not trained well enough or by cutting maintenance and technical inspections to the mandatory minimum. Even the major airlines are doing the same, hounded by the competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The quest for profit is not compatible with the quest for safety. We will vote for the amendments aimed at improving safety, but we are against every aspect of a policy that is based on competition, whether or not regulated at European level, because it will create an enormous mess and can only end in disaster.</p>

You succeeded in getting it through the high-level group and in laying to rest many misgivings at national level, and, although Mr Schmitt is right to criticise what has emerged from the conciliation procedure, we do all agree that the system has undergone fundamental change. It formerly consisted of cooperation under Eurocontrol, but under Eurocontrol alone. The Member States were sovereign, there was no Community law, and each and every state could escape scrutiny by insisting on its own sovereignty. With this legislation, we now have a Community law that nobody can evade, one that can be adopted and amended by a majority, and the Commission’s role as guardian and administrator of Community law means that no Member State can admit that it is doing something not quite right in its own airspace control and safety measures, while asserting that it is no business whatever of the Commission’s. On the contrary, there is a manifest sharing of responsibility, and the Commission is at the heart of the implementation of the new law. I see this as a very great step forward, and one that is very much to be welcomed. As a result, I believe, we will be able to reduce waiting times in the air and at airports, and this will be to the benefit of passengers and airlines. We will be more successful on the environmental front, as every aircraft that spends too much time in parking orbit has a disastrous effect on our environment, and we will make progress in terms of safety, for fragmented technology and cooperation will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I have to tell my socialist and post-communist friends that their belief that air navigation services must be provided by the public sector is one that I cannot go along with. If, though, we look back over recent years, let us ask ourselves where it was that service was always provided according to the book? Where was it that aircraft were left hanging in the air? The country that always occurs to my mind is one whose air navigation services are staffed by State officials, who do not necessarily make for better and more effective use of airspace. This, Commissioner, is something we need to discuss together as and when the opportunity arises. Following this legislative act, I believe, we will need – perhaps in two or three years’ time – a new initiative to introduce competition among air navigation services, where, as much as anywhere else, competition is required if performance is to be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Further to the last Council common position – which my Delegation broadly supported – and the subsequent conciliation procedure, we are now able to fully support this regulation. During the process, one of our key objections concerned the inclusion of military operations and training. I am delighted that this sovereign competence is now excluded. Had it not been excluded there could have been an adverse impact on NATO operations, so I am also delighted that this is no longer the case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, care needs to be taken during implementation that the newly-created bodies – i.e. the single sky committee and the industry consultation body – do not duplicate their efforts, thereby causing unnecessary confusion. It is quite clear that the aviation industry cannot continue to sustain the loss of USD 4 billion per year due to airspace congestion across Europe, and I believe that this regulation will go some way towards addressing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurocontrol should also be congratulated for its initiative, put in place in January 2002, which introduced reduced vertical separation. I understand that we have increased capacity by some 30% and reduced delays to the levels we saw in 1998-1999. However, it does behove certain countries and areas, such as France, Italy, Spain, southern Germany and Switzerland, which are responsible for 44% of the delays, to make radical improvements nationally if this regulation is going to succeed. Another area which needs to be addressed urgently is the shortage of air-traffic controllers across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, with this regulation we should improve safety, efficiency and the economics of air traffic management, which, as air traffic across Europe continues to grow, is good news for the industry, for business and for the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This, ladies and gentlemen, is not merely technical satisfaction. Some Members have already said that, on this issue, we could certainly have done more, we could have achieved more, we could have gone further in terms of the level of harmonisation, but I would invite you to reflect on the satisfaction that we must feel from a political point of view: we have, at any rate, succeeded in breaking a taboo, since from now on – and armed with a regulation for achieving it – we can talk about a single European sky; of course, not yet at the level that we want and hope for, but nonetheless on the basis of an actual situation of which good use has been made. There is even more reason to be satisfied because this provision belongs within a framework that has already brought other provisions to bear: I refer to the one, approved by the Council, on denied boarding, and the one – and I really hope that it will be adopted – that Mrs Maes is preparing on aircraft safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must also be satisfied, because this is the Europe that the citizens understand best, the Europe that the citizens feel close to, because it is the Europe that increases their safety, enhances their rights and increases their satisfaction with the response to their expressed needs. I believe that the citizens will be our main allies when, on this issue too, we seek to progress and achieve the results which today are not within our reach but which we will certainly be able to achieve in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the encouraging prospects that have been illustrated here are certainly more significant than the doubts raised by the debate in previous years in committee and within the Council and the Commission, and which have also been expressed here today. What I would like to stress – and in doing so I support what previous speakers said in their speeches – is the political aspect, as well as the emphasis being placed on defining this agreement as historic: we must not forget that it is the same emphasis which, ten years ago, we placed on abolishing territorial borders, which at the time seemed a miracle and which paved the way for real European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reached certainly represents a balanced compromise given the many difficulties and the selfishness of the various sectors which, quite rightly, set down their interests and competences. The result is, therefore, a result that is due to everyone, but I too would like to express my satisfaction that you, Commissioner de Palacio, focused on this objective with great tenacity, together with the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and also ourselves as members of the committee. The result is satisfactory. The new role of Eurocontrol and military and civil cooperation have been highlighted, but I would also like to stress the interoperability of the European air traffic control network and the issue, no less important – which you, Commissioner de Palacio, emphasised – of the certification of service providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly positive – the rapporteur Mr Fava mentioned this, and I would like to say that I completely agree with him – is the matter of sanctions for service providers and airlines that breach the provisions of the single sky, with safety objectives set, not just for the benefit of our European citizens but also for the benefit of all those who are to use, and fly in, the skies above Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have broken a taboo, according to Mr Lisi, and we would perhaps have liked to have gone even further and to have created more common ground, and I am sure that in the coming years there will be modifications to these two regulations, to this legislative package, with a view to improving it. Once the degree of trust increases, and the application and reality of the Single Sky becomes the norm, and we all see how we can combine the elements relating to the concepts of sovereignty and defence, which are present in airspace, with more appropriate, efficient and safer management of airspace within European civil aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the honourable Member, Mr President, because it is true – Mr Dimitrakopoulos – that your work during the conciliation procedure was key. Also key was the work, as I said a moment ago, of the two rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and all the people responsible within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that for the Commission, and for me personally, this is one of the three great initiatives which I will always remember from my time in the European Commission. Then we are going to talk about another one, the GALILEO Programme, as soon as we finish this debate. With this initiative, together with GALILEO and certain others – perhaps maritime safety, despite the fact that some people do not yet see it like this – we have carried out a genuine revolution and we have changed the limits, the borders, of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this initiative we are Europeanising our airspace, which was previously not European. Through this initiative, we are truly creating a European airspace, we are creating a European sky, furthermore combining guarantees for States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am just going to make a brief comment: there are certain Members who say that on the whole issue of functional blocks there should be Community competence; <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, although it is not exactly the same, it is as if the Commission had full competences in relation to defining road routes or railway networks and in relation to constructing them. We must also take account of the will of the States. It cannot be done in a contradictory manner, the Commission must provide this European thinking and this European component which is perhaps not always present in the national view, but it is obvious that without the Member States we cannot carry out this kind of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that Eurocontrol, throughout these years, has also made very great progress. And I believe we have contributed something to these improvements because Eurocontrol is aware of the process and the impetus that exists and, in this regard, I am extremely pleased that we have been able to finally achieve full Community participation in Eurocontrol, which has been extremely important, as well as the organisation of its cooperation in the whole Single Sky process.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying just one thing: what the Commission has never done in relation to this initiative has been to throw in the towel. Some have perhaps done so at certain times, but the Commission, and myself personally, have not done so.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, I began in January 2000, with a series of meetings in which civilian and military chiefs participated, when no progress had yet been made on defence aspects, though over recent years progress has been made. There was no COPS or anything like it but nevertheless they came and, I would insist, at that time, it was believed that our initiative was impossible. We have been able to separate the issues and resolve what could be resolved and not paralyse everything as a result of trying to resolve everything. Because we all know that one way to ensure that nothing happens is to try and achieve perfection overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we have achieved today is very important, and that it is this very mixture of a vision of creating a European Single Sky and of realism, which has guided our action, both in Parliament and in the Commission, and also – I would like to point out – in the Council, which has allowed us to take pleasure today in a positive result, which is an extremely important step, which we all know will be followed by further steps, but which is the first step in this new frontier of the Single European Sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
