<p class="contents">The first of the good qualities is the fact that it is essential. The second is that it really is an important step in the right direction for the coal industry. The slight defect is that it contains a certain number of inaccuracies which have not been removed at the committee stage.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is essential because the previous arrangements will expire in July 2002, hence the need for a new regulation. Above all, it is essential because of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, which is the legal basis of the previous arrangements governing aid to the coal industry. The restructuring of the coal industry in Europe has not been entirely completed, so there can be no question of not having a new regulation on these arrangements for State aid. This proposal is also a step in the right direction insofar as it makes provision for production aid to cease in 2007. In fact, I believe that it is inevitable and desirable to make provision for the cessation of this aid, since coal and steel products will be re-integrated into the common law of the Treaty on European Union following the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">My attention and the discussions in committee were concentrated on the revision, from my point of view, of this text, an important revision, because it consists of supporting the creation of what is known as an ‘indigenous primary energy base’ in order to preserve the European Union’s independence regarding this product.</p>
<p class="contents">This creation is slightly surprising in a text which originally had only a technical purpose. In any case, it calls, and has called, for the following comments from me and from a certain number of other Members. Is Europe threatened if this indigenous primary energy base is not created? Is there any strategic interest in creating such a base? In other words, is coal strategic, and is indigenous coal production within certain limits strategic to the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">My reply to these two questions is negative. I believe, and the experts agree with me, that the world coal market is characterised by both great dispersion of supply and great stability of prices in the medium and long-term. The risk of shortages is quite small. In addition, there are a number of products which could claim strategic status, and therefore the replies obtained from the Commission have led me, I regret to say, to propose that this revision be stated separately in this text in order to deal with this problem. The period of validity of this regulation is set to end in 2010. I had proposed that it should end in 2007, for the sake of consistency, because that was the year, in the Commission proposal, for ending production aid. I regret to say that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not agree with me, and my report was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, I invite you to vote for this report on the original version of the Commission proposal because, despite its uncertainties, inaccuracies and obscurities, the proposed regulation is a step in the right direction, towards support for the restructuring of the coal industry, albeit for a limited period of time. I believe that this is how that support should be given, because it cannot continue indefinitely.</p>

What shows that it is not such a bad compromise is the fact that these conflicting interests and views were also, of course, present in Parliament and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and our agreeing, the second time around, to support this very Commission proposal, which is nearly a year old, says something about the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We – by which I mean my group – will in any case, when we eventually come to vote, be supporting it without amendment, and we will keep to what we agreed in committee. That notwithstanding, whereas Mr Novelli made a few critical comments from his standpoint, I do so, of course, from my own, for any agreement on the details does not indeed prevent us from having outlooks that differ overall. If the translation is accurate, Mr Novelli, you twice spoke in terms of the Commission proposal envisaging the cessation of production subsidies in 2007. That is not actually the case; rather, production subsidies are to continue until 2010. That is right and proper. Closure aid is to come to an end in 2007. I do, though, have a small problem with that, in that, in view of our desire for a strategic base of this sort and, of course in retrospect, the need for capacity to be adjusted as well, I can very well imagine that we will also need aid for closure and reconstruction, especially if it is maintained that this base, too, has to be underpinned by laws on the grant of aid. No single Member State, no matter which one, can do as it pleases about this, but it must, both before and after 2010, be monitored by the Commission in accordance with the laws on subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few difficulties with the phasing out of aid as well. It is indeed the case that they have to be marked down on a sliding scale. What the Commission is proposing appears to me to be a bit too mechanical. On this point, I would recommend to the Council that they should just think a bit about whether they can refer back to what the ECJ decided when they ruled on the subject in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point has to do with the clause about the post-2007 assessment, which was mentioned in the proposal. We should think again about that as well; otherwise, our approval of the Commission proposal is unconditional.</p>

That report, far from helping to reach a consensus around the European Commission proposal, which was viewed by the majority of the members of our committee as balanced and comprehensive, meant sudden death for the European coal industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand it meant cutting aid to companies in the sector, and reducing the periods within which our industry could receive that assistance. Given the importance of the issue, particularly for the families and regions that depend solely on that activity in the European Union, the majority of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy came to an agreement on a fair and balanced consensus text that is none other than the draft regulation from the European Commission. That regulation envisages maintaining aid to that sector at least until December 2007. During that period the European Commission will evaluate the development of the sector, both at Community level and at world level, and if necessary will put forward fresh proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it should also be remembered that this date is in some way subordinate to the security of energy supply that the European Union needs, as this is a factor that the European Commission will undoubtedly take into account when formulating new proposals. We think that this is an important subject that should be treated as a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand it had incorporated the positions of those who wished to remove aid to this industry, which is fundamental for energy supply and for social cohesion in our countries, while on the other hand others among us would have liked to go further and have greater certainty about what is going to happen after 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the report was rejected in committee and as the chair I was given the task of conducting the necessary negotiations to solve the problem, because we would have been unable to deliver an opinion on the Council’s decision. This was why I contacted Mr Novelli, as he had already worked on this report, and also, out of parliamentary courtesy, I thought it was appropriate to consult him as to whether he wanted to put forward the only text that could receive a consensus, which was the Commission’s text, and Mr Novelli agreed, which I thank him for. He thinks it is a step in the right direction, as do I. He thinks that it goes too far and I do not think that it goes far enough but it is, however, the only possible text, and we therefore think that we should give it majority support and comply with the agreement between the different groups, which is not to adopt any amendments modifying the Commission’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the ball will be in the Council’s court and we hope that it will adopt a solution that is in line with the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greens are in favour of restructuring aid because we have an obligation to support restructuring in coal-producing areas so as to provide future prospects for the workers and their families living there. By contrast, we are categorically opposed to providing aid in order to ensure security of supply, because there is a world energy market which is liquid, where prices have not changed for the last twenty years, and where the countries of origin, the United States, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, are stable. It is ridiculous to give millions of euros to subsidise European coal, which is three, five, ten times more expensive, as long as the world market is liquid. If we were to pursue this economic policy in other areas, I believe that that would amount to a return to nationalism and it would mean the end of world trade if each continent were to pursue policies of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that point I am at one with the Commission, even though the relative amount of energy produced from coal has become very small in comparison with other primary energy sources. I even think that the Commission should have made even more emphatic reference to hitherto unused capacity to derive energy from coal, as greater effectiveness can be achieved through improved technical procedures, especially combined heat and power.</p>
<p class="contents">If we – as is indeed only right – include indigenous primary energy sources and thus also coal in the European strategy for security of energy supply, this inevitably leads, in the case of coal, to the requirement that the Member States should have the right to grant aid in this sector, as Community coal production is made uncompetitive by geological conditions and environmental and social standards in the EU. This means that the classes of aid proposed by the Commission – operating aid, closure aid and help with meeting inherited liabilities – are sensible and necessary, although there might very well be different opinions about the period for which this regulation is to run.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find regrettable about the Commission proposal, in view of the imminent enlargement of the European Union, is that it does not include the coal-producing acceding countries in its scope with effect from the date they join, which is indispensable, and the periods for which the regulation is to run are far too short for these countries to be able to carry out the necessary and painful restructuring of coal mining in, for example, Poland and the Czech Republic. Poland, in any case, produces more coal than the whole of the European Union put together, totalling 102 million tonnes in 2000 over against the EU's 85 million tonnes. There is a need to catch up here. My group supports the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those Member States that want to apply coal subsidies have to decide on this themselves and take responsibility for it, even bearing in mind that the subsidies are very high, and that the money involved could perhaps have been used to promote other, forward-looking, industries. The European Union is being asked only because it has to rule on the compatibility of these subsidies with the European market. A qualified majority in the Council is required for that, Madam Vice-President – and it is you personally that I am addressing, if you would be graciously pleased to listen to me. It must not appear as if an essentially superfluous unanimity in the Council is being concocted, as is currently being attempted through an unparalleled deception after the example of the fraudulent Conference of Nice. It is not on for manifestly illegal subsidies by other Member States to be sanctioned by means of a unanimous resolution, with, for example, French, Italian and Dutch subsidies to freight carriers being declared not to be detrimental to the common market. That adds up, per annum and per lorry, to a subsidy of EUR 7 000 to the benefit of freight carriers in some countries and to the detriment of those in all the others. That such a thing can be unanimously sanctioned in the Council, thus contravening the European Treaties, is a scandal!</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, a policy of that sort flagrantly violates the Treaties, and does so with consequences that are incalculable. I note that the conditions specified in the Treaties for such permission to be granted, even unanimously, are not fulfilled, and I call upon the Commission to contest these fraudulent outcomes of Council meetings in the European Court of Justice and, if possible, to put a stop to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the concept of viability in the industry should be strengthened. Productivity improvements should be demonstrated where financial aid is made available. The second point is that because of low world prices, developing reserves in existing coalmines is very often difficult to finance and this accelerates the closure programme. Support for such developments should be included in the provisions. I would also like to associate myself with remarks made by Mr Markov. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent years our number of miners has dropped from twenty-four thousand to around eight thousand. I therefore share the desire expressed by my colleagues the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, and Mr Rapkay, that we should adopt the Commission’s proposal, for various reasons. First of all because it guarantees aid until 2010 and gives us some time. Secondly, because it also talks about CO2 emissions, and rightly points out that, with the decrease in coal production CO2 emissions associated with its use have decreased, and because it states that, with the current directives on emissions, industries are obliged to ensure that their new processing plants make a more serious effort to prevent pollution and use the latest techniques available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also highlights the social and regional consequences, and no one here can forget them. I think that each of us is aware that in Germany, Asturias, León (our neighbouring Autonomous Community) the same thing is happening and we know what happens when miners’ families and the whole industry surrounding them are left without work. The Commission therefore also highlights the need to maintain regional cohesion. And we need to take into account, Mr President, that the most recent agreement, for example in Spain, between the government and the unions, extended decreases in production.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that the only concern we have about the Commission’s proposal is regarding what will happen after 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Otherwise, an abrupt end of support would cause a chaotic situation. However, it should not be a licence for endless subsidy. The UK experience shows that it is possible to have a competitive industry, but that the adjustment process can be tough and painful. Deadlines are necessary to force action. I would prefer a shorter deadline, but I respect the compromise we reached in the committee to support the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise the importance of coal to the EU energy supply and I want to emphasise the aspect of security of supply. We are, in Europe, already heavily dependent on imports of coal, and therefore there is a case to maintain some domestic production. Coal represents 16% of our final energy supply in Europe. I believe that our subsidies, however, should be directed more at clean coal technology for greater efficiency and lower emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the recognition of the United Kingdom coal industry's achievement in improving competitiveness and I would like to close with the thought of challenging the logic of subsidising production of coal at around EUR 140 a tonne on the one hand, while on the other hand phasing out much more economically efficient nuclear production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am aware that this has been a complex issue, but as has been demonstrated today in the discussion, I think that in the end, as Mr Westendorp rightly said, the text that we put forward was the only one on which there could be this consensus and that could give us a way out and a solution in the face of a Treaty that is expiring. As Mr Novelli said, it is an innovation. It is true that to some extent it is an innovation when we move from a guarantee offered by a specific Treaty to an internal Regulation as part of the general rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I hope and trust that the Council will now be able to reach a political agreement at the Energy Council on 7 June, and I hope following the vote, with the support of this House, and that, with the Council meeting we will conclude the procedure for adopting this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is based on the discussions in the Green Paper on a European strategy for energy security and supply, and it is true that it is not a question here of whether or not we are under threat. I think that what we have to consider is whether we are more or less vulnerable, whether we are more or less secure, because I think that this is the concept that we need to have in mind. And being under threat is not exactly the same thing as being more vulnerable. Frankly, and this is why I have put forward this proposal, I think that it is precisely by maintaining strategic coal reserves that we can be more secure and less vulnerable to certain crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have very vulnerable points along the entire energy supply chain. And I think that after 11 September we need to consider that although the risks are very remote, they do unfortunately exist and we cannot ignore them.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years the European Commission has been putting forward proposals in order to increase the contribution of renewable energy sources, mainly within indigenous primary energy sources. Those proposals mean increasing our security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense it is important that the Member States that have coal resources should have a Community framework that enables them to continue to maintain access to them and to maintain minimum production to guarantee that access, within the focus on supply security, to minimum indigenous primary energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the amendments tabled by Mr Turmes, the Commission does not feel that the proposal to withdraw references to the contribution of coal and renewable energy sources and the creation of a base of indigenous primary energy sources is in line with the principles of consolidating supply security and for that reason we cannot accept them. We wish to stress that, when dealing with issues associated with energy and the environment, the Commission’s focus is an overall one that takes into account all the issues associated with energy sources and their use.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment stating that the aim of the new regulation is to incorporate coal products into Community law, the Commission considers that coal products will become a de facto part of the scope of application of the EC Treaty once the ECSC Treaty expires. We do not therefore consider this amendment to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission’s proposal is what I would even describe as harsh due to the requirement of continuing with the restructuring of the industry by closing the production units that do not contribute to the plan to safeguard coal resources and due to the reinforcement of the principles of progressive reduction and transparency in the granting of State aid. However I think that this is what can and should be put forward at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that it is consistent with the three pillars of the principle of sustainable development: security of supply, economic rationality and social and regional cohesion. A moment ago we were hearing from someone with very direct knowledge of a region such as Asturias, about how we are faced with these issues. In terms of the environment, it envisages promoting cleaner technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our proposal, which I hope will be favourably viewed by the European Parliament today, takes into account the dimension of the enlargement of the European Union, as some of you have said. Poland and the Czech Republic need to continue with the restructuring process that has been underway for more than a decade and with this proposal we are giving them a framework in which to carry out those changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to thank you most sincerely for everything you have said, even those who were more critical, and I think that this is a balanced text, which I understand leaves a little to be desired for some and a lot for others, but I think that it is what can and should be put forward at present in order to maintain stability and a clear framework of relations in this key sector for some European regions particularly, but also for enlargement and for security of energy supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
