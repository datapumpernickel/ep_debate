Because the compromise text significantly modifies the Commission's 1997 proposal, the Commission has asked the Council to reconsult Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Parliament and the Commission share the same analysis: all of us would have preferred a more ambitious compromise, especially as far as the approximation of tax rates is concerned. This is mainly due to the decision-making process and the unanimity requirements in the Council. Co-decision and qualified majority voting would undoubtedly have led to a better result for the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am very happy to see that Parliament's committees responsible for the analysis of the text – the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy – have supported the compromise. This future directive remains a positive step, both for the internal market and for sustainable development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">To that extent, nothing has changed in comparison with the rapporteur's view on the initial proposal in the 1998/1999 session. As you may remember, Mr President, it was said then that the proposal was 'modest but useful'.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Caudron, for their speedy examination of the text. It is of crucial importance that the opinion of Parliament be adopted as soon as possible, so as to allow the directive to enter into force on the scheduled date, 1 January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reply at the end of the debate giving the Commission's opinion on some of the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not go back over its entire history, but I would like to stress, in connection with what you have just said, that in 1999 the European Parliament adopted a report, for which Mr Pat Cox was the rapporteur, which improved the Commission's proposal, in particular in three respects: Parliament asked for an increase in all of the minimum rates stated in the Commission's proposal; it also called for these minima to be index-linked, and finally, it called for the number of derogations and exemptions to be reduced. As you yourself pointed out, we have had to wait four years for the Council to reach an agreement and for Parliament to be re-consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the report seeks to support the compromise struck in the Council – acting, as you said, under the constraint of unanimity – despite the text's serious shortcomings, the Council of Ministers not having in fact taken on board the proposals made in the Cox report in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on two points amongst many where the position adopted by the Council appears to us to be weak. Firstly, the minimum rates set by the Council to be applied from 1 January 2004 are, almost without exception, lower than those proposed by the Commission in 1997 and by the European Parliament in 1999. Such a step backwards stands in flagrant contradiction to the undertaking given by the Council, and in particular the European Council, to provide instruments that seek to break the link between economic growth and energy consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that we have addressed is that of derogations and exemptions. The text of the directive is littered with them. The Council has added an annex with a virtual shopping list of individual exemptions and derogations so that each of the 15 Member States can find what they want in the list and can therefore agree to the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Having referred to the position adopted by Parliament in 1999 and taken into consideration new political material such as the Gothenburg European Council's declaration in favour of a Sustainable Development Strategy, as rapporteur I therefore proposed to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we should reinforce Council's position on certain points, while retaining a moderate stance bearing in mind the different political sensitivities.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I proposed bringing forward the second step of motor fuel taxation and the revision of tax rates by two years. I also proposed a sunset clause for all derogations, whereby exemptions and derogations could only be maintained if the Council explicitly so decided. Finally, I proposed making it mandatory to support renewable sources of energy. In principle all renewable sources of energy should be fully exempt.</p>
<p class="contents">I confess that it came as an unpleasant surprise when all of the amendments were rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – and I do not share your approval, Commissioner. It is true that in many cases they were rejected by a majority of one single vote and that not all Members of the committee were present. I therefore think that the logical step for me, as rapporteur, is to re-table these amendments in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Commissioner, I would draw your attention to Amendment No 2, tabled by Mrs Kauppi and adopted by the committee. If it were to be confirmed in the plenary it would mean that Parliament was denying the very timeliness of this proposal for a directive because we recently adopted a directive on emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that Parliament's vote in September 2003 does not represent a retreat from its 1999 position, although this was adopted, it is true, during a different term of office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As everyone has said, the Council took a great deal of time to reach this agreement, since the Commission's initial proposal dates back to 1997 and Mr Pat Cox's report to 1999. Despite this, we agreed to play ball and treat this as a matter of urgency given that it is clearly in the general European interest to do so. Although there are many areas with which I and my fellow Members are dissatisfied, as rapporteur, so as not to threaten the agreement in the Council, I only proposed amendments that enhance that agreement. Although the agreement reached by the Council does not go as far as the Commission's 1997 proposal or the European Parliament's vote in 1999, it still remains a first step, in my view and that of my fellow Members, towards establishing a common framework for taxation in Europe. The amendments adopted by unanimity improve it by providing for time limits for exemptions, so that the exemptions do not become the rule; by specifying units of measurement and by reinforcing the political signal in favour of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">I dare to hope therefore, ladies and gentlemen, that when Mr Jonckheer's report is put to the vote tomorrow the plenary will confirm an agreement that is for the time being, admittedly, minimalist, by seeing it as part of an ongoing process to serve the interests of the environment in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is a good and positive sign that an attempt is being made to harmonise the environmental point of view with healthy competition in the energy markets. Common minimal levels of energy taxation are needed and the polluter pays principle is important, as long as we remember to give attention to the effects on competition and employment. Furthermore, emissions trading, which is beginning to be implemented, is an important means of regulation, and we can therefore also avoid regulation overlapping with it, as would be the case with taxation of energy products and the various exemptions proposed thereto.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of energy taxation, in general renewable natural resources should be treated favourably, and in the same way there should be tax relief on new fuels that are particularly environmentally friendly. In this way we can use financial incentives to steer both consumers and industry in the direction of environmentally friendly energy use. The Commission proposal on tax incentives with regard to certain biofuels is worthy of our firm support.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this directive does not directly deal with hydrogen, for example, it is a good, and will in the future be, an important energy source that in time could clearly replace oil for transport in particular. It is obviously worth supporting hydrogen in matters of taxation. We have to remember, however, that any form of taxation that deviates from neutral taxation has an impact on market activity and for that reason any such support measures as these should be temporary and exceptional in nature, in order to promote new fuels and production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The troubled aviation industry has enjoyed tax exemptions on air fuel for a long time. Taxation in this area is a problematic issue because aircraft can choose fairly freely where to refuel. If a tax were imposed on air fuel within the EU but not outside it, this would lead to refuelling outside the Union. That is why the international agreement on the tax-exempt status of air fuels should be respected. The Member States have a right they must not lose to decide themselves on taxes on fuels for local use. These fuels, such as peat, for example, which is important in my country, are of no importance to a viable internal market, but at local level they may well be very important and necessary sources of energy and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland and the other Nordic countries taxes on energy are already widely applied, so these countries would have no problem with even shorter periods of transition. I, however, have yielded to the will of the majority in my group. My group is not in favour of a shorter timescale, as Mr Jonckheer has proposed. In other words, I personally would have been prepared to go further in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Bolkestein also made it very clear that this minimum solution is a small breakthrough, but that the European Union has not actually succeeded in a consistent approach to energy taxation. This consistent approach remains coherent though, and after the experience with fiscal coordination we can almost be grateful because once again we had to experience how much the unanimity rule in fiscal decision-making hampers the functioning of the internal market. It is extremely regrettable that the fourth Environment Action Programme, which envisaged that sustainable development and economy could be stimulated not only by environmental regulation but also by tax regulation, could not be implemented, and so this directive’s tale of woe goes further back than just 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the directive also has the defects – as has already been said – of low minimum rates, non-indexation of minimum rates and also the difficulty of derogations. We have already debated the issue of derogations on several occasions in this House. I believe that we have actually always agreed that there have to be derogations for energy intensive enterprises, but that these derogations should at least incorporate conditions enabling the situation to be tackled. This has not happened, and so this directive is bound soon to be followed by another.</p>
<p class="contents">What is positive is that this directive is not only a framework for the taxation of all types of energy, including electricity, but that at the same time it also supports the promotion of renewable sources of energy and thereby will surely be able to give additional impetus to further develop these renewable sources of energy. That is a good thing, because we know that it is renewable energy that gives not only Europe, but also world civilisation, a chance, since we all profit from the tax incentives for using environmentally friendly forms of energy. Actual primary energy generally costs nothing, and furthermore it can be obtained and converted where energy consumption takes place. Thus the steering effect of tax incentives for energy use is an important addition to the EU Environmental policy and, I believe, also to emissions trading. Rather than seeing this as a contradiction, here too, I see it as adding to the instruments that steer our European economies and lives towards sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also to be welcomed that this directive will make possible the final implementation of measures for preferential tax treatment for biofuels, on which we have already agreed, but the regulation of which was, of course, coupled to general taxation. I can also see that the goals that we set can be achieved. I would just like to emphasise once again that in the past many Member States have taken advantage of the revenue effect of environmental taxes, in particular, energy taxes. I welcome the fact that in the meantime we can at least have the possibility of reaching a European agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his view that the proposal is a small step in the right direction. Mr Cox wrote a similar report as long ago as 1999. If the Council had followed his directions, the basic conditions would have been different now. Just as the Commissioner says, the long period required for discussing this issue shows how important it is for us to obtain a sensible decision-making procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s environmental problems must be seen in a pan-European perspective. The EU is a unique tool for creating common environmental rules. The EU’s environmental policy must be developed by means of more stringent minimum rules and environmental charges. It must be possible to take decisions on such rules and charges by qualified majority voting. As is well known, this is an extremely sensitive issue. Some of my fellow MEPs visibly shake when EU taxes are mentioned. I nonetheless hope that the Intergovernmental Conference can devise solutions when it comes to energy and environmental taxes, together with a robust decision-making system.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s and the Member States’ task in the energy sphere is to formulate requirements concerning safety and the environment, to check that the requirements are being complied with and to promote research and development in the energy sphere, aimed at replacing fossil-based energy production with environmentally friendly energy sources. We should nonetheless be very careful that, with taxes as a weapon, we do not seriously reduce competition in the energy sphere. A rational energy policy is best promoted through free trade and the free production of energy. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support most of the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are asking the Russians to make an effort to combat climate change and environmental pollution. I personally experienced the need for this in the form of a serious chest irritation during my stay in Moscow. Even in Russia, a clean environment has a price tag, despite the pledges of financial support and cooperation. To bring this need to attention in Moscow is all the more difficult, given the fact that we in the European Union are already so reluctant to pay a price for a better environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s draft directive for energy taxation is a striking example of the lack of unanimity in making efforts to bring about a better environment. An environmental tax on energy has been the subject of discussion and negotiation for more than ten years. Only in the past six months, under Greek Presidency, did it seem possible to agree on a compromise text. However, it became a compromise that left something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">My first observation is that the Council is still lacking the vision and audacity to take decisive action and move the tax pressure from the area of labour to environmental pollution. In this way, employment can be promoted and environmental pollution given a real price. A second point of criticism concerns the many interests of the Member States and industries which are taken into account in the proposal. As a result, the proposal contains too many exceptions and exemptions. As such, the amendments that aim to restrict the conditions for exceptions receive my support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to bring to your attention a few other matters. First of all, I should like to argue in favour of biofuels being made exempt from energy taxation. In that way, the development of these clean fuels is given a fair chance. It would be quite ludicrous to grant subsidies to promote biofuels with one hand and levy taxes on these fuels with the other. Secondly, I should like to point out that it is important for the proposal on emissions trading to be taken into consideration. Both instruments can co-exist and complement each other. I should like to warn the Council to ensure that the directives do not overlap during implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in his report, the rapporteur argues in favour of abolishing the unanimity rule where tax matters are concerned. Although I consider energy taxation to be a valuable instrument for reasons of content, I cannot share the view on the unanimity rule. This is why I will not be supporting Amendment No 13 although I support the rest of Mr Jonckheer’s report. The idea of energy taxation as a supplement to the agreements that have been reached with regard to emissions trading has been mooted before. It is time we were serious about its implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the long period of time during which the Council has considered the matter – one lasting more than five years – has been a disappointment. Now is the time to put the disappointment to one side; making headway in the debate on the directive is the next step in an inevitable direction. I am happy to note that it is just this sort of practical approach that we also see in the report drawn up by Parliament’s rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has declared a commitment to adopt instruments to be able to decouple economic growth from energy consumption. The Commission has also committed itself to such aims, and so has Parliament. In principle it is therefore not an obstacle to significant change. In practice it is sorely needed. The directive now up for discussion offers an opportunity for this and it is our responsibility to implement it soon. In the integrated European economy the solution must be more coherent than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">While energy taxation satisfies the parliamentary needs of Member States, at the same time it provides the means to lighten taxation on labour and employment and is an effective and precise tool for guidance in what is, ecologically speaking, the right direction. Taxation on energy products is the link that has long been missing which ties all the small parts of sustainable development together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would furthermore like to raise the matter of the connection between energy taxation and the Directive on emissions trading that was recently completed. Independent studies show that responding to the challenge of climate change will be most favourable in overall financial terms if the reduction for sectors outside the emissions trading scheme is set at the right level. Cuts across the board will not bring that about: we need a comprehensive energy taxation system. We have to ensure that each branch of industry falls within the ambit of either energy taxation or emissions trading. That way, every company, through taxation, will be looking at a maximum price that is the equivalent of the marginal cost to society.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs an ambitious energy taxation system very quickly. It would seem that the Commission and Parliament are to shoulder the responsibility for establishing one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A formal modification of the Commission's proposal would significantly postpone the entry into force of the Directive, and might even endanger its adoption during this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">But as the Council will be examining the proposed amendments in early October, the Commission will do its best to have the relevant amendments included in the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, the Commission could agree in principle with amendments 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding amendment 2, I would like to point out that it is my intention to make a dedicated proposal on this subject early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue behind amendment 4 is that of establishing a common definition for reference units in the Directive. The Commission is pursuing this goal in the Council's working group.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, despite some sympathy with amendments 6, 9, 14 and 15, the Commission considers that reopening these issues might endanger the whole compromise. Therefore, the Commission regrets that it cannot support these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission furthermore does not support amendments 5, 10, 11, 16, 17 or18<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thus far about the amendments. I should also like to make a few general remarks. Firstly, Members of Parliament will understand that this whole business is increasingly made difficult by the existence of the unanimity rule. The Commission has proposed very modest changes to the unanimity rule in the form of qualified majority voting in the areas of simplification, modernisation, co-operation against fraud, and the establishment of a harmonised tax basis for company taxation. However I am pessimistic as to the possibility of those very modest proposals being accepted. It is regrettable, but it is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would direct a remark towards Mrs Kauppi. Mrs Kauppi has said that hydrogen is a source of energy, but I am afraid that is not true. Yes, one can use hydrogen in cars and maybe in the future in aeroplanes, but in order to use hydrogen one must first get it. In order to produce hydrogen one needs electricity. Therefore, I am afraid that whatever the advantages of the so-called hydrogen economy – and the Commission is fully aware of these advantages – let us not forget that in order to get hydrogen one must produce it and that costs electricity, a lot of electricity.</p>
