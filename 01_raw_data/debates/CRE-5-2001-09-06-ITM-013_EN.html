<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as you suggested, this report is meant to focus on the real opportunity that the UN Special Conference on Children and Children's Rights which takes place later this month gives this Parliament to focus on a fundamental way in which we can tackle global poverty. It is an opportunity for us not only to give a profile to this subject but also to call for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me set out what the targets are: free and compulsory education for all, halving adult illiteracy by 2015, eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We are quite tired of hearing about development targets. They are set and they are endless. We know the ‘whys’ for all these development concerns. What we from the Committee on Development and Cooperation are asking is ‘how’ we are going to deliver on these targets. The subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we, in our committee, discuss on poverty. The EU clearly has a key and central role to play here. Clear commitments were made at Dakar in Senegal last year. But neither from the EU nor anyone else really are we getting practical strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a teacher myself for 30 years, mostly in primary education so I think I am quite justified in having a passion about looking at the reasons for this crisis. One in six of the world's population are functionally illiterate. One hundred and thirty million – one in five – of the total number of children are not in any kind of primary education. One terrible statistic is that two-thirds of those are little girls. Their learning situation is terrible. Many of will have seen children trying to learn sitting under a tree with not even a blackboard to assist the teacher. When we talk about information technology we are often talking about children who have never even held a pencil in their hand, never mind being likely to sit at the keyboard of a computer. In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear link between illiteracy and income poverty. Average incomes in a country mirror very clearly the levels of access to education. There is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education. A 10% increase in girls' enrolment in primary school would bring a substantial improvement in infant and maternal mortality rates. And yet we see aid from developed countries to basic education being slashed from budgets across the globe. It is only 1% of the total.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education. The sub-continent of India spends less than 1% of GDP on education. As far as the EU is concerned, I hope the Commissioner will agree that this is not enough. I hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures. We need an answer from the Commissioner on how we intend to implement the goals. I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa. I also know that there is a promise of a communication on basic education from the Commission during the Belgian Presidency. I would like to know when we might expect to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just touch on one or two issues. Priority for girls obviously, and I suspect that Mrs Junker will speak about that. Last in, first out; that is what happens to girls. Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school. I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school. The impact of HIV is enormous. There are millions of AIDS orphans in the developing world and in a country like Zambia there are more teachers infected annually with HIV than they are able to train to put in their schools. These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the targets looks difficult. Is there sufficient political commitment in current circumstances to ensure that we will get all the girls into school by 2005? The reality is, and I hope that people will admit this very clearly at the UN Conference the week after next, that as things are going all of these targets are unachievable. Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult. I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign. It is a very successful, active and dynamic campaign. I would hope that the European Commission is very much engaged with them but I suspect that is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Global Education Campaign, the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year. This is the equivalent of four days of global military spending and 9 minutes of international currency speculation. Therefore it seems to me that if the commitment was there, we could deliver. It is a price worth paying. The current inequities that I have described are untenable and certainly indefensible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect. While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development. Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to.</p>
<p class="contents">The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty. In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level – as one of the Dakar commitments states.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education. And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015. All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes. It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education. Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all. Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences, because, at the end of the day, they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of declarations recognising that child education in the under-developed world is one of the main conditions if those countries are to be able to begin to free themselves from the situation of justice and backwardness they are in.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock’s report mentions the numerous commitments made in this regard by the international community on different occasions. The latest was the world conference on education, which took place in Dakar last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, however, is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities. Incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the developed countries which, despite their promises, have not only failed to increase their programmes in favour of education and care for children in the developing world, but in fact have reduced their efforts in that area. And incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the countries of the South which, apart from very few exceptions, are still neglecting the education of their youngest citizens in the face of other priorities such as military expenditure which, in the majority of cases, is still above what is invested in education.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which we are voting on should not remain, like so many others, as a worthless piece of paper. This call for coherence and responsibility is a genuine demonstration that our Parliament should promote this issue as a European Union objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, this report should serve as a reference for the action of the Union and many European States, members or candidates for accession, at the United Nations General Assembly which will take place in New York in a few days time. Glenys Kinnock will be there and will speak out clearly, in the knowledge that we all support her and with the strength which the support deriving from our approving her proposals will give her.</p>
<p class="contents">Documents such as this are the best way to respond with specific proposals to a form of globalisation which, since it is mainly focused on the market, is creating inequalities, poverty and exclusion on a world scale and is therefore becoming repellent to many people throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by offering our thanks and congratulations to Mrs Kinnock on her work. It will be important to implement what is expressed here, but we must start by broadly distributing the report. This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe. It will also contribute to some people outside our territory recovering their confidence in us as well as their own sense of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, that good primary education is still far from being granted the priority status that it deserves. Good, free education is essential for development. Nine hundred million people are still illiterate. The Dakar objectives are in danger of not being achieved by a long chalk. For this reason, new impetus is necessary at the highest political level, particularly from Europe, America and Japan. There is an urgent need for a strategically developed initiative with a realistic timescale and more financial resources. Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, the European Union has paid far too little attention to education. The argument that other donors are already doing sufficient is simply and demonstrably untrue. The cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors. Many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority. It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education. If India continues to spend less than 1% of its GDP on school facilities, of course, development will never come off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent. Certainly, special attention will have to be paid to girls, early school-leavers, and also former child soldiers. The basic rights of children will only be respected if adults draw the right political lessons from failing educational practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share her scepticism about the great conferences where people in expensive suits and large expense accounts meet to talk about priorities that they afterwards immediately forget, while the education budgets of the poorest countries are falling and the number of children condemned to illiteracy continues to rise. I really have the impression that a number of countries are acting like some governments in the nineteenth century: keep them poor and keep them stupid, then they will be less trouble. That is, in fact, the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education. That primary education has also had far too low a priority in our own budgets for development cooperation. Fortunately, fellow MEPs have already said much that is true. I will therefore restrict myself to a few suggestions relating to that primary education in Mrs Kinnock’s report, which are particularly pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">That education must be free. Children must not be excluded because they cannot afford primary education; otherwise they are condemned to the street, condemned to exploitation through child labour, and so on. On the contrary, we should actually give scholarships to children from poor families, so that they can go to school, to cover the miles, to pay for their uniforms, etc. The teachers must also be paid, they must be trained and they must receive a wage that enables them to survive in a decent way, so that they do not have to leave the children to their own devices because they must urgently earn something extra to at least give their own families some food. It is clear that national action plans will need to be put in place. I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem, but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency. We are far too inclined to sit on the sidelines with our expensive specialists and our expensive NGOs, while we, in fact, give far too little support to the meagre educational facilities in those countries themselves. That does not detract from the fact that I expect the EU to translate all those words into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries. There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education. There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms. Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect. That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books. Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert. They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example. This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations. The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions. The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally.</p>
<p class="contents">Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback. In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit. It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods.</p>

Your report rightly highlights the need for urgent measures to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar. The Commission has also decided to put development policy, especially the education and health sectors, at the top of its agenda in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Child welfare is a fundamental concern and a basic objective. An objective that we want to pursue mainly though social policies in sectors such as education and health. Related questions were addressed last year in the Council and Commission declaration on the European Community's development policy in connection with the fight against poverty. They also play a pivotal role in the Cotonou partnership agreement. The Commission has also stepped up support in the education sector and focused measures on basic education, especially primary school education, in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Community has considerably increased the general funds allocated to this sector in comparison with others. In addition, most programmes to promote primary school education contain special clauses for the benefit of girls, in order to counter gender-based drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific considerations and recommendations which relate to the Community are concerned, I have the following to say: first, the education sector is instrumental in the strategy to fight poverty, which is the overriding aim of the Community's development policy. The Commission shares the view that clear objectives need to be defined, that education aspects need to be included in the fight against poverty and that civil society needs to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also takes this standpoint in negotiations with developing countries on strategies to fight poverty. The Commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Community made a formal undertaking in Dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that education is a human right. This means that the Community has also subscribed to the call for countries seriously committed to education not to be impeded in implementing this objective by a lack of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complementarity between Community measures and national projects, with the help of the Group of Experts on Education, and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore stepping up its collaboration with UNESCO, especially by supporting UNESCO in coordinating education for all partners. The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar. It is also promoting the objectives of education for all in its negotiations on the ACP countries' strategies for the ninth EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the difficult question of setting up a global fund for basic education is concerned, the Commission feels, given the Commission procedure for programming and implementing aid, that this sort of fund is not a practicable solution. However, the Commission does not in principle reject the idea of a global initiative, as provided for in the Dakar framework for action, even if the implementation methods need to be discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the question of children's rights is closely bound up with the gender problem in general. Education targets for children, especially girls, will not be met until women have an equal status in the family and in the various societies. The Commission is very firmly in favour of paying particular attention to the education needs of girls in developing countries. It is currently preparing an action plan on equal treatment for men and women which should deal with this problem. It is also taking gender-specific questions into account in all special education programmes.</p>
