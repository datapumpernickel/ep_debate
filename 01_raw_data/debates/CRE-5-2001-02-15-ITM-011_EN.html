I believe that it should be considered that we have reached a new stage in the development of the European Union and in the integration of the economies in the European Union. Today twelve Member States make up a Common Market with a single currency. A domestic market in the original sense. It is imperative that economic policy in this European domestic market is drawn up in accordance with common guidelines. In this respect, we are pleased that the European Commission and the Ecofin Council have taken action in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first time that a decision regarding one of these Member States has been taken in this way and this decision concerns the stability of the European currency. As you are aware, in all debates in this House my group has repeatedly granted the utmost priority to the stability of the European currency and we shall continue to do so in future. We believe that a stable currency is one of the key building blocks for a social market economy and that this is also necessary for the European currency. Let there be no doubt that this shall remain a priority for us in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would ask whether the European Commission and the members of the Ecofin Council have picked the right target for this, the first decision of its kind. Ireland is without a shadow of a doubt one of the European Union’s model children. It is questionable whether other countries are in the position to reduce their deficits. Ireland achieves surpluses. Other countries still have a huge total debt of over 100% while at the same time Ireland is in the process of reducing its debt to under 40% and so can likewise be held up as a model for other European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">While other countries are battling unemployment, Ireland has made exemplary progress in this regard with the creation of new jobs. While other Member States are battling with slow economic growth, Ireland is enjoying growth rates that other Member States can only dream of. It should be said, however, that the Irish economy is overheating as a result of this strong growth and that, consequently, there is a risk that this could be to the disadvantage of the Irish people. For example, if I take rent and property prices in Dublin and compare these with those in Frankfurt it becomes quite clear that the development of these prices also has a detrimental effect on the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect clearly something must be done. The question is, however, who shall take the action? Should it be the European Union who intervenes or is this a matter that should and can be settled by Ireland, the Irish Government or the Irish Parliament themselves? This then raises the question: who should be responsible for European economic policy in the future? We must work towards ensuring that this responsibility is set out quite clearly. We must be clear on who is responsible for what, so that where there is success praise may be given and where there is failure, which may also occur, we are able to say that a particular country or a particular institution is at fault. A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union. The European Union is without doubt responsible for competition, the competition between businesses in the European Union. As Commissioner Mario Monti has demonstrated time and time again, the European Commission takes this task very seriously indeed. The European Commission is also responsible for currency stability, on the one hand through the strong European Central Bank and on the other hand through finance ministers, charged with monitoring the stability and growth pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability. Responsibility for taxes, on the other hand, still undoubtedly lies with the Member States of the European Union. The same applies to social security systems and education. This then raises the question: what is happening with currency stability or, more precisely, have occurrences in Ireland jeopardised currency stability within the eurozone? Just imagine a different situation. Imagine that the inflation rate in Germany stands at 6 or 7%. As Germany makes up one third of the gross national product in the eurozone, this would instantly lead to a sharp increase in the average inflation rates in the European Union, to such an extent that the European Central Bank would be forced to spring into action and thus the economy would be curbed. Ireland is however a small economy with a gross national product little above that of west London. The overheating of the Irish economy has no influence whatsoever at a European level, so there is no need for action at the level of the European Central Bank. Ireland no longer has the opportunity as before, when the Irish Central Bank could raise interest rates, of contributing to the deceleration of the economy. Therefore, Ireland must themselves be responsible, also for the Irish people, for reducing the overheating of the economy somehow or other. How this is to be achieved I leave up to the Irish. I do not wish to raise this at the level of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, turning to my second question. On 12 January a decision was made by the European Commission to pay EUR 401 million to Ireland. EUR 726 million in supplementary funds followed, funds that were also pumped into the Irish economy. In this regard I would like to ask whether a conversation took place between Commissioner Solbes and Commissioner Barnier with a view to resolving this obvious contradiction. In other words, what is happening in Germany, in France and in Italy gives much more cause for concern regarding the stability of the euro. I hope that the European Commission will have the same courage, when it comes to dealing with these large countries.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, I should like to thank Mr von Wogau for having raised a subject I believe deserves to be debated. His approach was correct when it comes to the way in which this matter is to be reflected upon, and I shall try to follow his line of reasoning.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin at the end, with the question of why our decisions do not in any way affect transfers of resources. Why are we talking about the coordination of economic policy? We are talking neither about problems of regional policy, nor of competition, nor of taxation, nor of any other such factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make an initial remark so that we are all familiar with, or are clear about, the model we have agreed in the Treaty of Maastricht, according to which the coordination of economic policies is based on a tool, known as the broad economic guidelines, approved each June by European Councils at the proposal of the Ministers of Finance. This is the basic document for economic policy coordination, and one with which you are very familiar because you have had occasion to discuss it more than once in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This document includes decisions of a general kind, together with decisions aimed specifically at Member States and containing practical recommendations which – I want to emphasise – are unanimously approved by the European Council. Obviously, the document also includes the points of view of each and every one of the Member States which sign the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain a proper balance between fiscal and monetary policies, the Stability Pact is, of course, implemented alongside the broad economic guidelines. As a result, we may sometimes have the impression that, as in the case of Ireland, actions are taken which may be difficult to reconcile with observing the criteria of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important to say first of all that Ireland has met the requirements of the Stability Pact and continues to do so, with more than enough room to spare, and that the Irish authorities deserve every kind praise for pushing ahead with their structural reforms and running the public finances well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Irish economy has continued to grow very strongly in the year 2000, but also true – and we are now coming on to the first point you raised – that it is overheating. Is overheating important in terms of a balanced overall picture? I have no intention whatsoever of getting into whether each specific measure is or is not correct. Such measures are the responsibility of the Member States, and I have no objections to make. We are talking about general, overall positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Overheating of the Irish economy is not a new problem. It dates back to 1998 and had already been revealed in the broad economic guidelines. It was also revealed in 1999 and again in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2000 – and I am referring here to a decision adopted by the European Council, proposed by the Ministers of Finance and applicable in every Member State – it was stated that, given the further overheating of the economy, budgetary policy had to be used to ensure economic stability and that the 2001 budget ought to be managed with that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">What are, so to speak, the contents of the 2001 budget? I believe that knowing this may help us to clarify two issues: what is the reason for the concern of the Commission, firstly, and of the Member States, secondly. I shall quote two facts from the 2001 budget: the fact that the current expenditure approved in the budget assumes a 1.06% increase in Irish Gross Domestic Product, and the fact that tax is to be reduced by 0.57%. As a result of these two factors, total demand is therefore being stimulated to the tune of 1.6% of Irish Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another fact I think is interesting on the subject of the broad economic guidelines we were talking about. The message is to seek or maintain a balanced budgetary policy and, if necessary, to have a somewhat more restrictive budgetary policy designed to offset any difficulties Ireland might have as a result of a monetary policy which is defined for the eurozone and is, logically enough, too expansive for Irish conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">If, for example, we analyse the figures which we normally use to see how economies behave and which show the main impact on the cyclically adjusted surplus, we see that, whereas in 2000 the figure was a budgetary increase of 0.4% of GDP, in 2001 the figure was 0.9%. This matter is certainly being discussed by the Irish Government and the Commission. The former believes that the figures we have calculated show an additional 0.3% increase. On the basis of the figures provided to us by the government – and this is the topic under discussion in Eurostat – we are able to arrive at somewhat different figures. That is why, in the recommendation, we effectively acknowledge this situation and refer to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">I would turn now to a third factor. An important topic when it comes to the behaviour of economies is the way in which supply operates in relation to demand and whether the growth in demand is more rapid than existing supply. In technical terms, we measure this using what is called the potential output gap, which shows the amount by which demand is growing in excess of supply. In 2000, the potential output gap was 4.5%. In other words, Ireland was demanding 4.5% more than what it was producing. In 2001, that figure has risen to 5.4%. We are therefore talking about a very expansionist budgetary policy, at a time when the Irish Government has committed itself, in terms of the broad economic guidelines, to a budgetary policy which, in principle, ought to be more restrictive with a view to offsetting the other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the second point which you raised and which I think is especially interesting: the fact that the Irish economy is relatively small and its impact on the eurozone minimal. That argument makes sense and might lead us – like many economists – to conclude by asking why, if we did not have any other types of commitment, we should take action over Ireland if that country does not affect monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that, in connection with this argument, we ought to be asking ourselves two related questions. Firstly, can we treat the Member States of the European Union unequally? And should some Member States be able to do what they themselves consider appropriate while others cannot, according to whether they are smaller or larger countries? The second important point is that we could discuss whether that is the model to be applied in the future. But in any case, that is not the model we are applying today in accordance with current legislation. It is therefore absolutely vital, at least from the Commission’s point of view, that, if we are to fulfil our role as guardian of the Treaties, we should apply the Treaties in the form in which they exist at present.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the Commission did what it considered its duty, which was to send a recommendation to the Council of Ministers in accordance with the provisions of Article 99(4). I very much emphasised the fact that, when I speak of a recommendation, I am not referring to sanctions. I appreciate that, from the media’s point of view, it is much more appealing to talk in terms of sanctions. When we speak about recommendations, we are indicating to the Irish Government that the budgetary policy it has defined is inconsistent with what they agreed and will lead to additional problems concerned with the overheating of its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement, we put a figure on the recommendation, saying that we considered there to be 0.5% overheating. That is something we can discuss. The figure will vary depending upon the methodologies we use. On that basis, it is obviously for the Irish Government to do what it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s position was presented to the Council of Ministers, which approved it by consensus. That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment and, like yourselves, I believe it must be accorded due importance because, if it is indeed an important milestone in applying our model for coordinating economic policies, we ought not to attempt to draw conclusions of a kind which the Commission never of course intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, Commissioner, when we in Ireland signed up for economic and monetary union, we accepted the central tenet of economic and monetary union, namely closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The key elements in this process are the stability and growth pact, which is at the heart of economic policy coordination. Secondly, we have the annual, and I underline annual, broad economic policy guidelines – a lesser known element of the economic policy development process.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as European-wide, there are country-specific guidelines identifying policy priorities and particular circumstances. Commissioner, I was listening carefully to see if I could extract from what you said precisely what breaches of the country-specific guidelines Ireland is guilty of to warrant the recommendations of the Ecofin Council under Article 99 of the Treaty, last Monday, at your behest. Our finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, told the Irish Parliament this week that he had no problem with advice to Ireland setting out the Council's view of the appropriate policy mix to achieve economic stability. But he felt this view should have taken the form of an opinion, as in the normal course, particularly in view of the comparative performance of the Irish economy relative to other EU Member States. An opinion, Commissioner, rather than a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response? Would not an opinion have sufficed, given the very heavy political fall-out from the recommendation in Ireland, where we are in an election year and very likely face a referendum on Nice, this episode has been oats to the eurosceptics. And the same applies elsewhere, particularly in the United Kingdom. There is also nervousness about the Commission's involvement in tax policy generally in the post-Nice situation. This latest episode does not help. I fail to see why Ireland's transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully, more diplomatically, with more understanding – both by you, Commissioner, and indeed by our somewhat maverick, though genial, finance minister.</p>
<p class="contents">To many observers it appears to have been in the end about egos and macho behaviour all round – all in the context of an economic turnaround in Ireland in the last six to seven years that is the envy of many. The charge is that Ireland is to seek to achieve economic stability and, in that context, our last budget was deemed to be over-inflationary.</p>
<p class="contents">There are occasions when "a one size fits all" economic model does not fit. The biggest threat to Ireland at the moment is wage inflation fuelled by 75,000 job vacancies. Securing the continuation of social partnership with our unions, employers, farmers and government and, through it, wage moderation has to be a priority for our government given its huge contribution to our economic success over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that a 10% increase in the GDP per annum is not sustainable, given the pressure on labour supply and house prices. But even IBEC, our employers' confederation, has said that our budget must be understood in the context of social partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to point to one single factor that has contributed more than any other to the turnaround in the Irish economy, I would have to cite the Social Partners' Agreement which allowed us to trade competitively in the single market and to attract inward investment because of the stability it brought to wage negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the unseemly public debate over the censure, the lack of diplomacy in handling this issue by both sides and the very negative political fallout that has ensued. Time does not allow me to run the numbers of Irish economic success. I have no doubt my colleagues coming after me will do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Irish Government's response to the European Commission and to Ecofin has been arrogant and reckless. Reckless, because it has needlessly damaged the standing of Ireland in the Union and because it feeds xenophobia in Ireland by putting in doubt the possibility of the Nice Treaty being ratified. Reckless, because it feeds Eurosceptism in the UK and Denmark and it cannot be in the long-term interests of either Europe or Ireland for either Denmark, the UK or indeed Sweden to remain outside the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore the stance taken by the Irish Government. I believe that its position is being driven by the growing Eurosceptism in the two minority government parties. For example the Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Mary Harney, recently indicated her preference for the American economic model rather than the European social model, stating we are closer to Boston than Berlin. I do not agree, however, with the MEP from the PPE-DE, Mr Werner Langen, who is quoted in the <span class="italic">Irish Independent</span> newspaper today as saying that Ireland should be further penalised by the withdrawal of cohesion funds. Such a step would be a gross overreaction as well as being illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call again on the Irish Government to accept the Ecofin decision and to sit down with the Commission to discuss how it can best be implemented. I would also call on the Minister for Finance to accept the long-standing invitation from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of this Parliament to come and talk to us and explain the Irish position in detail, so that we can understand it and learn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Irish Parliament this week, the Minister for Finance outlined five main points on which he claimed he was at odds with the Commission and Ecofin. He claimed that the Commission recommendation and the Ecofin decision are unreasonable, unwarranted and a misreading of the Irish economy. He stated that the Irish tax cuts made over the past three years have been contractionary, not inflationary. He said that the Irish budgets have not been procyclical as measured by the Commission's own calculations. He stated that the Commission methodology overstates fiscal loosening this year because it does not take into account once-off factors such as a shorter fiscal year in 2001 and he stated that an opinion would have been a more appropriate step than a reprimand. The Commissioner has dealt to some extent with some aspects of that case. I would like to hear Commissioner Solbes address this House today in detail on those points so that we can have some clarity as to the issues that are actually in dispute between the Irish Government and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That really is a peculiar observation to make. It would be more natural to hold the best pupil in the class up as a model. That was how it was when <span class="italic">I </span>was at school.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland’s economy is prospering. Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent. Unemployment is at less than 4 per cent, and the country also has a genuine budget surplus. Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent. Unemployment is less than 4 per cent, and the country also has a genuine budget surplus. The impoverished Emerald Isle has turned into a Celtic tiger. The EU has therefore been too hasty in issuing a warning to Ireland, since the situation of the country is being disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is a small country dependent upon foreign trade and with an economy closely linked to the British and American economies. The falling rate of the euro has therefore had more of an impact upon Irish inflation than upon that of other EU countries. Inflation has fallen from 6 per cent in November to 3.9 per cent in January, and there is everything to indicate that it will continue to fall. The Netherlands now has higher inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you yourself stated, Commissioner, Ireland’s policy cannot jeopardise the way in which EMU operates. It is in this connection that you refer to Article 99 of the Treaty, and it is then that that argument falls down. Ireland accounts for only 1 per cent of the EU’s total GDP. For Ireland, the threat of inflation is mainly from external sources, but the EU and yourself are demanding internal measures to get inflation down. The EU’s action is politically unwise and does not increase confidence in the EU and EMU, above all in those countries which are at present outside the eurozone. I want to conclude by asking Mr Solbes Mira why he did not give Ireland more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, we have in the past shared and we still share the concerns that smaller countries have regarding the abuses that could result from excessive arrogance on the part of higher authorities or larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, we consider the decision by the Commission, exercising for the first time its right to reprimand with regard to the specific situation in Ireland, as totally unjustified and, at any rate, as a remarkable blunder given the number of Eurosceptics criticising European integration. We believe that it is totally unjustified, first of all, because the admittedly high level of inflation in Ireland may also be related to the specific nature of the Irish economy, which imports not just its oil but also most of its spare parts from two countries, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, who, over the last few years, have significantly revalued their currencies in relation to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that there is no evidence at all that the 2001 budget is “pro-cyclical”; quite the opposite, the American air pocket and American slump risk making it an extremely counter-cyclical budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is that although tax reductions by the Irish Government are, admittedly, too high, this issue should have been tackled at the time when, for years, Ireland carried out fiscal dumping by lowering company taxes, thus attracting companies from the continent. It is absolutely incredible that this criticism should be made when the reduction in tax affects citizens rather than companies.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the topic of our debate and say that I welcome the opportunity that we have to give our views on the significance and impact of the decision that the Commission, then the Council, have taken to use for the first time the Treaty of Amsterdam provision in order to address not a sanction, Commissioner, but a public reprimand to a Member State, in this instance, Ireland, as well as to severely rebuke several other countries for not complying with all the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that this will provide many people with food for thought regarding the liberal logic of the current economic and monetary union, just months before the euro intrudes into the everyday lives of 300 million European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the others, I do not question the principle of such warnings which are the logical corollary of the coordination of economic policies. On the other hand, I denounce the underlying attitude. The guardians of monetary orthodoxy in the European institutions are obsessed with the idea of excessive public spending, excessive spending on social provision. They have no consideration for the shameful inequality that still exists in the social model that the European Union claims to represent; nor do they have any consideration for the need to promote the human skills necessitated by the information revolution, which is developing at lightning speed before our very eyes and which really has yet to take off.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that health spending, in particular, was specifically targeted in the Commission’s criticisms of various Member States, one of which was France. On almost the same day, the Commission decided to bring a case against France before the Court of Justice since it was guilty of charging the lowest income families a lower rate of VAT on some of the price of electricity and gas. Over-restrictive measures of this kind are not the way to survive the crisis of confidence that citizens are experiencing towards European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to the public comments made by Mr Prodi regarding the criticism of Ireland which, up until now, has been presented as a model of success. When the President of the Commission said that sometimes, the schoolmaster must punish even the best pupil, he revealed a stunningly original perception of the new European method of governing. I am counting on the great debate on the future of Europe, which has everyone talking, not to focus on abstract institutional reforms alone but to be based on actual experiences such as those of citizens in the countries which have been targeted by the harsh criticism of the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, first of all I want to thank you for chairing this session and also to thank the Commissioner for coming along. Tight control of budgetary spending since 1987, alongside a strong model of social partnership where the unions, employers and government came together, are two of the main planks of the present success of the Irish economy. Alongside this, our intention and our commitment to investing in education and in building up infrastructure and in particular to utilise the new opportunities in information technology are the further elements of this success.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland we have a commonly used phrase – "if it is not broken, why fix it". Our present growth rate at 11% is over three times the average of other Member States. We have a budget surplus of nearly 5% of our gross domestic product. Our debt/ GDP ratio is only 39%. Tax and expenditure levels at 33% make Ireland one of the lowest tax regimes in Europe. We have a binding commitment to provide 1% of our annual gross national product to meet our future public pension bills. Indeed the latest figures show that inflation, as measured on the harmonised European basis, in Ireland has now fallen to 3.9%. This rate of inflation is lower than in several of the larger Member States within the EU, if a comparison is made on the latest available economic data, for example, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind the European Commission that before the recent economic success in Ireland, the Irish people were required to make major sacrifices so as to guarantee that economic growth could take place. Ireland does contribute and wants to continue to contribute to the positive development of policies and programmes within the European Union. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the European Union budget where previously it was a net beneficiary. As well as that, Irish waters are opened up to European fishing fleets to ensure the continued success of the European fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the economic recommendations, which would help to improve the Irish economy, should be listened to and taken heed of. However, on this occasion, I believe that the European Commission has misjudged the special nature of how the Irish economy operates. Moreover, I do not think it fully appreciates how far we have travelled in actual terms in the improvement of our economic performance. I will give to the Commissioner a list of figures to put it into context. In 1991 the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty were agreed by EU leaders, and the green light was given to the operation of the single currency. Ireland's GDP in 1991 was IEP29 billion. It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion. In 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public services going. Today we have a budget surplus. In 1991, 1.15 million people were in our workforce. Today we have 1.67 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to specific events of recent weeks, I believe that any mention of financially reprimanding Ireland, which is being suggested in some quarters, would be a highly regressive step. Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination. Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories. The European Union has prospered in a spirit of cooperation between various Member States working together, pursuing common political interests. The EU will not prosper into the future if confrontation is the order of the day. I am elected to represent the people of Ireland, and I and my colleagues in this Parliament will continue to represent what is in the best interests of the people of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the holding of this debate on this occasion is very welcome. We welcome the opportunity to shout from the rooftops how proud we are of our performance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone comparing the macroeconomic indicators of the EU Member States, cannot escape the conclusion that Ireland is at present out in front. The criticism by the European Commission of the policy of the Irish Government therefore seems very strange. But on closer inspection it is nevertheless correct. Given the overheated state of the Irish economy, there is unmistakable evidence of a pro-cyclical policy when the Irish Government lowers taxes and increases government spending. And if Ireland is not given a reprimand now, it will be very difficult to criticise the policy of Member States in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile it remains striking that a small Member State should be attacked, while the economic reforms and performance of the large EMU Member States in general lag behind. Could Commissioner Solbes Mira indicate if he is aware that the criticism of larger Member States in the present recommendations seems to be couched in more friendly terms than in the case of smaller countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was decided to launch the Economic and Monetary Union back in the spring of 1998, I pointed out to the Commission the precarious situation regarding retirement provision in some Member States. Your predecessor, Mr De Silguy, simply refused to listen. I now notice that the Commission is voicing cautious warnings about this, addressed particularly to France and Italy. The ECB also expressed itself in disturbing terms on the subject in its monthly report for July 2000. If policy continues unchanged the burden of pension contribution will go through the roof in most Member States. In the case of one Member State to as high as 20% of GDP, maintains the OECD. Remarkably, the present election campaign in this Member State is being fought on tax reduction!</p>
<p class="contents">The longer the Member States concerned delay in tackling the pension problems energetically, the greater future budgetary problems will be. There is a financial time bomb ticking away. Meanwhile the Commissioner is still not speaking unambiguously. Surely it cannot be acceptable for necessary reforms to be repeatedly postponed, thus passing burdens on to future generations?</p>
<p class="contents">I expect you, at the forthcoming spring summit in Stockholm, to set out the rules and specifically warn the Member States Italy, Germany, Spain, Belgium and France. On this point Ireland has everything well under control. It would be opportunistic to conceal this. Because in the future Ireland, the Netherlands and others will be directly or indirectly burdened with the consequences of problems that their EMU partners knowingly and wilfully left unsolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is disproportionate because Ireland seemed rather like the good pupil in the European classroom and its level of inflation, which, at the end of the day, really is fairly low in absolute terms, does not threaten to destabilise the whole eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, why demand restrictive measures which might have a harmful effect on Ireland? In order to explain this, you have to look at the analysis of the new single monetary system, in which small adjustments achieved by varying exchange rates are replaced by a rigid single currency system, supplemented by strict procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, adjustments through markets are replaced by centralised, administrative adjustments. Is there any guarantee, however, that this new administrative process will produce better results than the market process? We do not believe that this is the case. The only guarantee is that an economic policy that does not suit all countries will be forced onto the various Member States. This rigid system may have disadvantages which, in the long run, will cancel out the presumed advantages of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still one question that has not yet been resolved. Is this compulsory unified policy one that has been determined by the larger countries for their own benefit and to the detriment of smaller countries, or could it one day perhaps backfire on the larger countries themselves? I have no pat answer to this question. At the moment, Ireland might well believe that it is part of the first scenario i.e. that it is a smaller country being sacrificed to the interests defined by the heavyweights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the question is more complex because, behind the condemnation of Ireland, there are larger targets in the firing line and France is, perhaps, the prime target. The point is no doubt to set a precedent for, or even to reinforce the idea of, referring to the multilateral surveillance procedure under Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that it can be extended to other Member States in the future. The process of constraint is, therefore, far from over. Europe’s disciplinary role may first affect the smaller Member States, but it may, in future, have an effect on everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both of them are saying to us that you do not have the right to grow, but you do have the right to spend.</p>
<p class="contents">To take the first point: you do not have the right to grow. Here we have a Member State, Ireland, which has an impressive budget surplus, an extremely small budget deficit, a very high growth rate and a level of inflation which, while it is too high, particularly because of reasons beyond its control, nonetheless respects the major part of what we said must be respected in the stability pact, Yet you are telling Ireland that growth is not a good thing, despite the fact that it has respected the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz is telling us that we must have the right to spend. I would point out to you, Mr Wurtz, that that is not the case in Ireland. Ireland does not spend excessively. It has strong growth precisely because of the fact that its spending is not excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on France, on the other hand, was to make a token gesture and issue a minor reprimand, but to state that the situation there is quite acceptable. Yet, I note that France patently does not respect its commitments. France had undertaken to reduce its public spending and to make tax cuts. This imbalance has been upset. We can see that the trend of reducing budget deficits is slowing down in France, whereas growth is becoming stable. We can see that France has the highest level of public spending of all the countries in the eurozone. We can see that France’s national budget is being used to fund spending on the wages bill, which, logically, ought to belong to the market economy. None of this is satisfactory but you do not say anything, because France, like Germany and Italy and other countries, is too big for you to handle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, concerned, Commissioner, because and I am not blaming you in order to have a real ‘policy mix’, you need to be bolder, politically speaking, to be better armed, legally speaking and to be equipped, economically speaking, with rather more complex analytical equipment than we have at our disposal. In fact, in this matter, we are suffering from a lack of Europe rather than an excess of Europe, and it is the smaller countries that are taking the rap for this deficiency! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not know when or how the Commission and the Council would be able to use this procedure in Article 99, and paragraph 4 in particular, if not on this occasion. Imagine that they had to do this next year. I do not think that would be possible. They have both been guardians of the Treaty as well as guardians of the general interests of Europe. As a consequence, economic policy coordination has not yet been achieved. Commissioner Solbes Mira has just presented a document that has been adopted by the Commission and which we shall study very closely; in other words. It is a document which will enable us to forge ahead in those areas. We would like to thank him in advance and we hope that we will be able to improve the system on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps what we should be criticising is the gap between BEPGs in the budget, rather than the recommendation that the Commission has just drawn up. When BEPGs, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, are set out, everyone is gathered around the table – Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and so forth. The issue that we are coming up against today is that once BEPGs have been adopted, everyone goes home again and adopts their own budget, almost completely forgetting what was established collectively, among equals. The problem today is that the Commission is dismissing a budget that the Irish Parliament has already adopted and it is assessing the outcome of internal debates held in Ireland, France, Germany and Italy after the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, like to congratulate the Commission once again for having adopted this resolution. Mr von Wogau wonders if the Irish economy may really has such an impact on economic and monetary union. Of course it does not, but you must go back to Article 99(4). It says that the Commission must make these recommendations and the Council must adopt them when the proper functioning of economic and monetary union is in jeopardy, and also when the economic policies of the Member States are not consistent with those that have been defined collectively. This is certainly the current scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the question or whether a large or a small country should have been reprimanded. Do you think that one day the Commission could have criticised a larger country which was sending out negative messages that might weaken economic and monetary union if it had not previously responded in this way to a smaller country? – I still do not know the difference between a larger and a smaller country, but never mind. – I do not believe so and I therefore welcome the decision taken by the Commission on Monday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we cannot be absolutely sure of that, of course, since meetings are held behind closed doors and sometimes also behind a smokescreen. Only very exceptionally, when things are really getting out of hand in one country, does Ecofin open its doors, does the smokescreen lift and does the colleague concerned get a public reprimand. This week, Ireland became the first country to suffer this fate. Are things going so badly with the Irish economy then? Can we really not trust the Irish? Not at all. On the contrary, Ireland is doing well, as has already been mentioned by many speakers. For five years Ireland has enjoyed an average growth of 5%, with unemployment down from over 16% to scarcely 4% and a budget surplus of over 4.5%. Admittedly there is a threat of the economy overheating and there is a risk of inflation, and that was not within the framework of the agreements made by the ministers themselves. But all in all it is not strange that the Irish should feel harshly treated. However, much greater risks lie in wait. The possible next Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, has announced that he wishes to lower taxation despite a budget deficit and despite a ratio of public debt and gross national product that is more than three times the size of Ireland’s. What we wonder is whether the Council of Ministers will administer a public reprimand here too. Commissioner Solbes Mira, though we have doubts about the necessity of taking Ireland to task, in the latter case you can count on our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The freedom of an elected government to frame its own budget in accordance with its electoral commitments is fundamental to democracy. I therefore urge Ireland's Minister of Finances not to renege on his promises to increase spending, on health in particular, and to lower taxes, especially for the lower-paid. I hold no brief for tax cuts for the wealthy, nor is this a budget that would be proposed by the Green Party. Nevertheless it is a programme that has been negotiated with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has particular difficulties with inflation because of its traditional ties of trade with the UK, which remains outside the eurozone. This is an aspect of Irish inflation which has been completely ignored by the European Commission. In fact, if the European Commission had deliberately decided on a course which would alienate the UK from joining the euro, by revealing itself to be an out-of-date bureaucracy which tries to bully elected governments in ways that are completely outside its brief, it could not have done better. This is absolute political stupidity to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">This interference with the Irish budget is the result of the Maastricht Treaty; the Commission is even trying to get governments to agree their budgets with it in advance, which was not part of the Treaty. I therefore anticipate a resounding rejection of the Nice Treaty in the Irish referendum this Summer because of this unwarranted interference and because this is a very bad treaty, as many in this House agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1994 the cumulative increase in employment has been 39 per cent. Today the economy is close to full employment, which is a huge sea change for Ireland. Irish unit labour costs are still more than 10 per cent below the eurozone average. Therefore both wage rises and tax cuts for the low paid are on the agenda for Ireland in 2001. I believe the Commission is deliberately trying to interfere in a field beyond its competence. We must not let this happen. Over the last five years there has been a dangerous increase in inequality with the rich becoming very rich and the poor becoming ever more marginalised. We will not and cannot tolerate this continuing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I encouraged Mr von Wogau to table this question because I believed that Parliament would treat this important precedent in a fair and balanced way – and indeed it has. Furthermore, I recognise that everything discussed in the Commission was in secret and everything discussed in the Council was in secret. And we had to accept the press releases from the propagandists when it was all over. So, at least in this House we have an open and democratic airing of the whole subject, and I welcome that very much.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we speakers from Ireland forgot to say was how much the European Union has contributed to the success we have. I do not want to go into all the details, but I want to mention one factor that is underestimated, which is the way that the Irish economy – being small and open – responded to the internal market. It is no coincidence that Ireland took off the day that borders were abolished in Europe and we got a free market. That was important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money. A Commission study, when Ireland had an economic growth rate of 10%, showed that the transfer of structural funds to Ireland only contributed 1.5%, if that. So the people who say that Ireland has grown on handouts from Europe are exaggerating.</p>
<p class="contents">What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister. He was told this by the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute, just as the Commission told him. He was told it by the Irish employers' association. He was told it by the central banks. And if he had a problem with it – with the trade unions demanding increased wages – it was because his policies had already stoked inflation and had already undermined their real incomes. Even if we were not in the Union and in Monetary Union, we would still be affected by the decisions taken by the European Union. In that sense, there is no such thing as sovereignty for a small, open economy like Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The minister is reputed to be a sportsman. A sportsman should have obeyed the referee when he blew the whistle when somebody broke the rules. Even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong, for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I would like you to answer the following questions: how do you think the Irish economy can be cooled down when the rate of inflation in Ireland is higher than the interest rate set by the European Central Bank and, therefore, money in Ireland is very cheap? You and your colleagues, Commissioner, know that, in the United States of America, there is a difference in the rates of inflation between the various states. This does not necessarily affect the stability of the dollar, however. Why should this situation, in the case of Ireland, whose economy only represents 1% of the European Union’s GDP, be crucial to the stability of the euro? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the Stability Pact several times, but not once did you mention the Growth Pact! I would say that stability is important if there is to be growth, and I would give the example of Ireland, which has been a Member of the Union for twice as long as Portugal and Spain. Nevertheless, it has already shown such high levels of growth that it has reached the Community average. This makes me wonder whether the Commissioner would not also like to consider the possibility of not seeing the Maastricht criteria, particularly inflation, as his Bible and whether there are not other, more important aspects for him to think about in order for Europe and all the countries in Europe to grow at a healthy pace? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, there are good reasons for supporting the Ecofin Council’s recommendation. The economic policy guidelines, on which all EU Member States have agreed, are concerned basically with ensuring that we do not once again slip into the galloping inflation and devastating budget deficit of the Eighties, which subsequently led to a backlash in the form of crisis and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is the first Member State which is now seriously beginning not to meet its inflation targets. Against the background of the crisis in the Nineties, it is therefore perhaps only reasonable for the EU to react. Now, things are beginning to go well for Europe again. No-one begrudges Ireland its fantastic growth. On the contrary, it is of course one of the foremost examples of EU cooperation’s really being able to help substantially improve conditions for an individual Member State. However, that is why we must not forget our experiences of the crisis during the Nineties. We must not compromise on our conviction that the fight for growth and full employment can, and must, be allied with a clear acceptance of responsibility when it comes to price stability and a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, can Ireland not be allowed to go its own way? The problem is that we of course live in an interwoven, internationalised economy in which developments in one country influence developments in the others. As long as only <span class="italic">one</span> small country infringes the guidelines it has itself accepted, the problem may seem small. Now, however, there are worrying signs that more countries may be doing this, in which case it will be important to send out warning signals early on.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, an attempt is now being made to feature the criticism made of Ireland in anti-euro propaganda. Just look, they say. If we take part in EMU, we shall lose our economic independence. The EU will even obtain power over our taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that propaganda of that kind is nonsense. Ireland has been criticised not because it is to reduce taxes, but because the reduction is to take place in a situation in which this may contribute to overheating and to inflation’s taking off again.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has issued a recommendation. No forcible means are to be used to take over Ireland’s tax and budget policies, despite all that is maintained by Swedish opponents of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tried to clarify a number of points in my initial speech, but I have a feeling that I did not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are not judging Ireland against any other country. We are judging Ireland against its own commitments, accepted in accordance with the broad economic guidelines. Secondly, we are not taking a decision that has just come out of nowhere and which was not anticipated. The Council’s 1998 recommendation already referred to the need for a stricter fiscal policy for Ireland. In the 1999 recommendation, a reminder was issued that, in spite of the efforts made, these were still not enough and, in 2000, after it was pointed out that the budgetary policy adopted by Ireland needed to be more restrictive, there followed a clear expansionist budget on Ireland’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about an expansionist budget, I am talking about overall figures. I have no quarrel with more health expenditure or more expenditure on reducing tax. Those are policy matters to be decided upon at national level. As Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, my concern is with the overall status of the Irish budget. However, it is not only <span class="italic">my</span> concern but also that of Ireland’s Central Bank, which I assume is familiar enough with the situation of the Irish economy and clearly understands that the current budget gives a substantial procyclical boost to the economy. That is the situation, and these are the facts we are judging.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, we can talk about what we are, or are not, to do. My duty as Commissioner responsible for these matters is to apply the broad economic guidelines, which are compulsory in a way that the Stability Pact is not. The Stability and Growth Pact – to answer Mrs Torres Marques – was decided upon following a Community regulation. The broad economic guidelines are the model we duly agreed for inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht. And what we have done is to apply this model strictly, as required. In contrast to what some believe, it is obviously not a position of the Commission. Rather, it is a position of the Commission and the Council. Nor, in making our proposal, did we proceed on the basis of any factor other than our own assessment of the point at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">No one should therefore imagine that there are motives or problems of any other kind, large or small. We are talking about consistency with the model we had duly established.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding. I believe that we have been showing understanding since 1998 but, in this situation, decisions obviously need to be taken at some point.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to the lack of diplomacy on the part of the Commission. I can assure you that none of the leaks that have appeared in the press come from my department in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it may be thought that the best pupil in the class is being punished. As I have said, it is not a case of our imposing sanctions. We are using a recommendation to highlight an example of incorrect behaviour in the light of the economic policy guidelines. And this is not inconsistent with good behaviour in terms of growth and inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">We could talk in much more detail. Mr Bradbourn intimated that not enough data had been provided. I am prepared to appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, whenever you think it appropriate, to comment in more detail on all the data we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 99(4) – which is one of the things you are concerned about – applies in accordance with the provisions of current legislation. There has been discussion about whether the censure of Ireland is or is not justified. In my opinion, it <span class="italic">is</span> justified. If it were not, this proposal would not have been made. Moreover, it is justified in spite of the limited impact Ireland has on the overall European economy. Clearly, there are – and I repeat – two reasons why I think the censure is justified: firstly, because of the obligations accepted by everyone in terms of the model we have defined; and, secondly, because I do not believe that anyone can seriously defend the view that, in terms of the model we have implemented, a country can be treated unequally on the grounds that it is large or small.</p>
<p class="contents">We can talk about other subjects which have also been raised: the problems concerned with Ireland’s contribution to European growth, specific problems, the development of inflation etc. I think that all these technical subjects can be discussed. It is true that nominal inflation has gone down in the last two months in Ireland. Nonetheless, when we talk about the overheating of the Irish economy, we are talking about underlying inflationary pressures, the operation of underlying inflation, the increase in salaries, the increase in the cost of living and many other factors fundamental to any correct assessment of what is happening in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Is our approach wrong? Here, we are embarking upon a subject that is difficult to assess because it is necessary to ratify the Treaty of Nice and because it is a factor that will impact upon other models. I would ask you whether you believe that policy assessments of this kind exempt the Commission from its duty to apply the Treaties in the forms in which they are established. In my opinion, the Commission has acted with sufficient prudence after having repeatedly urged the Irish Government to take a different course. The Commission presented the matter to the Group of Euro Countries and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council. The decision was not approved by chance. The matter was debated by the special group of the Economic and Financial Committee after each and every one of the arguments put forward by the Irish Government had been analysed. And, in spite of all that, the decision was taken, as I have just said, on the proposal of the Commission and, so to speak, with the assent of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission did what it had to do. I would again emphasise the significance of the term, ‘recommendation’. I am not talking about a sanction but about a recommendation, and I believe that we cannot draw any conclusion which takes us farther away from the content of that Council decision suggested by the Commission, namely to apply a standard which is there in the Treaty for the purpose of resolving a series of practical problems raised in the model we have established for coordinating economic policy. Although a different model may apply in the future, that is the one that is in force today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
