<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the September part-session we said that the draft budget presented to us by the Council took an accounting approach rather than a political approach. On Thursday we will vote here in Parliament on a clearly political reading of the budget. It is political in that it reflects the political priorities on the basis of which the parliamentary groups and Members stood for the European elections on 13 June. And we must remember that it was Parliament – the honourable Members – who stood for those elections, not the Council. All the honourable Members have thereby made commitments to the electorate which include defending and promoting measures which I hope are reflected in the draft budget I am presenting for your approval.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also political in that it responds to one of the Council’s habitual strategies, which is to fund its own priorities before it funds Parliament’s. In other words, through the vote on Thursday we shall try to create an interinstitutional balance, and without that balance the European Union cannot function properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, Mr President, to address a few words to the Commissioner, because today is her last day as a member of the European Commission. The Commissioner for Budgets always has a very difficult role to play between Parliament and the Council – two budgetary authorities which have no choice but to reach agreement, although on occasions it seems that agreement is a very long way off. The Commissioner is to a large extent responsible for the budgetary peace over recent years and I would, therefore, like to point out that, thanks to the agreements she and her team have presented at the last minute, we have managed to resolve certain complicated situations. I hope that she will be just as successful over the coming years in her new life beyond Brussels. In any event, I want you to know that it has been a pleasure for everybody involved in the budget to work with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The patience and negotiating skills of the outgoing Commissioner – and of the new one, let us hope – are going to be required for this first reading of the European Parliament, because it is very different from the first reading by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur and a veteran member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years, I am perfectly able to distinguish between the limits of what may be required and those of political reality. But this House has positions on certain items it will not relinquish. The reality is that the European Parliament is defending its priorities at a time when the budgetary situation is very difficult and very restrictive.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, we accept the Commission's preliminary draft budget as amended by the competent committees, the political groups and individual Members who have proposed amendments. You are already aware that there has been a technical adjustment to the maximum limits of Headings 3, 4 and 5, which in themselves create an almost insoluble problem in terms of achieving the figures for the 2004 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder – rapporteur for the 2004 budget – did a brilliant budgetary job. I am trying to do the same thing this year, although I am aware that the financial resources available to me are less than last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has cut internal policies by EUR 55 million from the preliminary draft budget, creating an impossible margin of EUR 108 million. The amendments which the honourable Members have presented to this draft budget, in this Heading 3 alone, represent more than EUR 350 million. And every single amendment is perfectly justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has cut external policies by EUR 129 million in comparison with the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, leaving a margin of 14 million, when the negative margin in committee was EUR 115 million and that already seriously jeopardised Parliament’s traditional external priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments to this Heading 4 represent more than EUR 400 million, and I must consider them, in part, because they fundamentally respond to the wishes expressed by two important parliamentary committees: the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In Heading 5 – the heading in which agreement may, in principle, have seemed the easiest to reach – the Council took it upon itself to make cuts which reduced the administrative spending of the Commission and the other institutions to one and a half points below the amount provided for in the Commission's preliminary draft and it is very difficult – as the Commissioner well knows – to maintain an administrative budget calculated to the last penny, if another institution then comes along and reduces it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank heavens that the Commission – and I would congratulate the Commissioner once again in this regard – has managed to make an additional effort to save without reducing efficiency. In any event, I would like to say that the European Parliament wishes to re-establish the administrative spending laid down in the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, we have had to establish a series of priorities. They are the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Lisbon strategy and its job creation and growth policies, because they are included in practically all the political programmes on the basis of which the honourable Members stood for election. At a time of difficult and weak economic growth in the European Union, it would be suicidal not to strengthen those policies which are aimed precisely at growth, development and job creation. We have therefore voted for amendments which increase these lines relating to the Lisbon strategy by EUR 80 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, communications strategy, in particular, because of the European elections and the low turnout at those elections, because of our enlargement and the need to explain the idea of the Union much better to the new citizens and because we are in the midst of a constitutional debate on the future of the European Union, this is another priority for Parliament and we have, therefore, presented an amendment to the tune of EUR 24 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, strengthening security, the fight against terrorism and the consolidation of a European immigration and asylum strategy. I believe this is a priority for all of you and, unfortunately, there is no need to explain why it must be a priority for Parliament and the European Union in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, another of our fundamental priorities is the consolidation of the European Union's external action, with a particular emphasis on combating disease and poverty and assistance for geographical regions. In this regard, we follow the principle that the European Union's new commitments cannot be achieved at the expense of Parliament's traditional priorities, or to put it another way, new commitments require new resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we want a very serious debate with the Council on the funding of the decentralised Agencies, which I shall analyse later.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the support received by the political groups in translating the priorities into budgetary amendments. From the other coordinators I have received nothing but support and positive suggestions. They have all sacrificed other priorities and they have all had to offer their colleagues complicated explanations of the decisions taken. And this is a message I would like to make very clear to the Commission and the Council: this first reading expresses a clear and unequivocal political compromise for the November negotiation. We are not going to vote for a second reading which abandons our priorities unilaterally. If there are going to be any sacrifices, they must be made by all the institutions, by all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now move on to the reading by headings, remembering that the vote the European Parliament will take on Thursday will be on the budget as a whole and that, as such, when it comes to the negotiation, we will take it to the three-way dialogues and to conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Heading 1 – Agriculture – we have voted for EUR 50 779 million in commitment appropriations. Our reference has been the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission, but we still have to provide the appropriations necessary to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">In subheading 1b) we have a political priority expressed by the Committee on Budgets and which, as such, will be included in the vote on Thursday. According to that, we raise the sum of EUR 57 million above the maximum limit of subheading 1b), the item which would go to the establishment and training of young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also increased appropriations on measures to eradicate animal diseases and food safety, because they are also Parliament’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In Heading 2 we are going to vote for EUR 42 378 million in commitment appropriations. Payments are the essential in this category, the category in which the amendments we present on payments have the greatest impact. In order to prevent and absorb the RALs, which now amount, ladies and gentlemen, to EUR 122 000 million – which represent one budgetary year – we raise the draft preliminary budget in those lines in which the RALs double the annual commitments. In the other lines, we support the Commission’s requests for payments, which we hope the Council will take into consideration. We are therefore raising our request for payments to EUR 3 800 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In Heading 3 – Internal Policies – we are voting for EUR 9 012 million, we leave a zero margin and are voting for an amendment with asterisk. In any event – apart from the traditional horizontal amendments relating to performance facilities and improvements in execution – our fundamental intention in this heading is to hold very serious discussions with the Council on the funding of the Agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, between 2000 and 2005 the number of decentralised Agencies has increased from 7 to 23 – this was Parliament’s idea; I remember the budgetary procedure during which we adopted it. The budgetary increase for the Agencies has risen from EUR 96 to 281 million and for the next 2005 budget we expect an increase of 20%. The number of staff posts for the Agencies has risen from 418 in 2000 to 2695. All of this has meant a reduction in the maximum limit for the heading of around EUR 134 million in order to fund other priorities. I cannot accept this situation and I intend to hold very serious negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purposes of the negotiation with this Parliament’s rapporteur for the Agencies – Mrs Haug – we have presented an amendment which affects all the Agencies and which represents a reduction of EUR 40 million, leaving the budget for them at the level of the 2004 budget. Our intention in this case is, firstly, to point out that the funding of any additional increase the Council intends for newly-established Agencies must be discussed with this Parliament, because with the financial straitjacket we are in, with the financial perspectives set from 2000 to 2006, this annual increase in the Agencies already has to be at the expense of Parliament’s priorities, and the Agencies are not Parliament’s only priority, although the Agencies do, of course, need to be funded and we are committed to that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about pilot projects. We have already agreed on a package acceptable to the political groups. Some of them are extremely important, such as the pilot projects for small and medium-sized businesses, combating terrorism, nuclear arms reduction and conflict prevention. I believe we are producing a broad and ambitious package.</p>
<p class="contents">In a similar way, in terms of preparatory actions I would like to stress the parliamentary agreement on the voluntary return of immigrants, on aid in the fight against poverty-related diseases – for which we allocate EUR 10 million, which I believe constitutes significant financial support – and, furthermore, the new strategy we have employed of treating certain pilot projects as studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Heading 4 we have voted for EUR 5 119 million – plus an amendment with asterisk. What is basically happening in Heading 4 is that we are once again faced with having to fund Iraq. This funding was not scheduled for 2005 and what is being proposed is that we fund it at the expense of Parliament’s traditional priorities, like the external policy voted for by Parliament this year, the previous year and in 2000. This is not acceptable either. Taking account, therefore, of the suggestions of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have requested that this heading be funded with the new resources provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement in the additional sum of EUR 190 million. At the same time we call in to question – or we place within the same package – the common foreign and security policy, which is very important to this Parliament, but its funding must be considered within the general framework of what needs to be funded in Heading 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are presenting a proposal which I hope will be voted for by a large majority of our fellow Members on Thursday and which will provide us with a serious position for negotiating with the Council, because I would insist that what we are taking into consideration are the political priorities this Parliament has set itself.</p>

I can remember, when you started a little over five years ago, how relations were between Parliament and the Commission in the area of the budget. There was almost a chill in the air on entering a committee room to talk about budgetary matters, because relations were not good after the fall of the Santer Commission. There was quite a lot of mistrust between the Commission and Parliament, and many hard words were spoken. I think that, through your way of working, Mrs Schreyer, and through the way in which you have tackled things, you have made a very large contribution to rebuilding trust between Parliament and the Commission. You deserve thanks for that. I really do think there have been fantastic successes throughout these five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say something about the budgets for the other institutions. We together decided, Mr Garriga and I, to follow a strategy in which we tried to find as many funds as possible under expenditure heading five so that we might return many of the savings agreed by the Council and so be able to meet the desire for staff increases as a result of enlargement, staffing reform and changes to financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the budgets for the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, the budget that we are now presenting, and that was adopted in the Committee on Budgets, has increased by EUR 10 million in respect of the preliminary budget from the Council. We have, then, returned close on two thirds of the Council’s savings, and that in actual fact makes it possible for all the institutions to implement the desired staff appointments as a result of enlargement and staffing reform and the reform of financial management. I am pleased that, in dialogue with the institutions, a solution has successfully been found that can satisfy everybody, or at least I hope it can, and I would thank you for your constructive work in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was especially unfair that the Council’s savings hit the budgets for the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor. These are small new institutions which are in the process of development, and I feel that the solution we have found in the Committee on Budgets is a reasonable result for these two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have only a very modest margin below the ceiling for the administrative expenditure. We have, in a way, almost used up the margin. I understand that new statistics from Eurostat show that wages will increase less than we had originally expected in 2005. When we reach the budget figures during second reading, the pressure on the administrative expenditure will therefore be less than we had at first believed, so we may perhaps, in spite of everything, find a margin.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also, in different institutions, investigated the possibility of whether, through accelerated payments this year, we might help create some leeway in the budget for next year. Last but not least, the institutions should of course continually ensure that administration takes place as efficiently and inexpensively as possible so that financial surpluses are prevented through cooperation between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Parliament’s budget is concerned, we have kept this down to 20% of administrative expenditure, that is to say 20% of the money under expenditure heading five. That level seems quite reasonable in relation to needs. I nonetheless wish to emphasise that, in recent years, it has been possible, within our budget – that is to say, within the 20% – for Parliament to expend quite a significant amount on buildings, thereby saving ourselves rent in future years’ budgets. There is a clear desire in the Committee on Budgets for us, in connection with such investments, to obtain increased transparency in Parliament’s budget. We are in the process of having two new buildings constructed in connection with Parliament’s building in Brussels. These two new buildings will cost more than EUR 300 million, and it must be assumed that the contractual negotiations are now at last progressing quickly enough for it to be possible, both this year and in 2005, to pay off a portion of this sum.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still the hope that it will soon be possible for a statute of members, which will guarantee MEPs uniform financial conditions, to be adopted for Parliament. The fact remains, however, that, even if a statute of members is adopted very quickly, it will take some time getting the new system to operate in practice. It is uncertain to how many MEPs a statute of members will apply at first, for there will obviously be a number of transitional arrangements. We have therefore thought it most sensible not to state an actual amount for what the statute of members might cost in 2005. A figure with what is called a ‘p.m.’ (<span class="italic">pour mémoire</span>) is quoted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2005 budget, EUR 17.5 million has, moreover, been appropriated to increasing the remuneration paid to MEPs’ secretariats. At the moment, some investigative committee work is under way in which we are looking at whether our rules can be written out in a clearer and more easily understandable way, and we in the Committee on Budgets have entered the amount for increasing the secretariats’ remuneration in the reserve while we await an actual decision from the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">An amount has also been appropriated from Parliament’s budget to a campaign concerning the new Constitutional Treaty. It is not a campaign in the sense that we have to go out and engage in propaganda, but Parliament’s leaders have felt that we in the European Parliament have a quite specific duty to ensure that the population of the EU is informed about what this Treaty really contains and is given a knowledge it can use as a basis for the votes that are to take place in the individual countries. It will be the national governments and national parties that do the information work with a view to the actual campaigns prior to the votes. It was felt that we have a special obligation, and that is something with which, in a way, I agree. We have a special obligation to provide information about what is contained in the new Constitutional Treaty, and that is what the amount appropriated from the budget is to be used for.</p>
<p class="contents">In its agreement, Parliament’s Committee on Budgets maintained the gentlemen’s agreement with the Council. We, for our part, do not interfere in the Council’s budget, and the Council does not, for its part, interfere in ours. In the course of our negotiations, amendments were, however, tabled that, in actual fact, cut into the Council’s budget for administration of the common foreign and security policy and, at the same time, cut into Parliament’s budget, namely that for the buildings reserve. The proposal was not accepted by the Committee on Budgets, but was retabled here in plenary. However much sympathy I may have for the intention behind the proposal, I did not, as rapporteur, recommend or support it. The intention behind this proposal is, of course, to press the Council to bring about greater transparency in the administration of the common foreign and security policy. It is, to a large extent, the growing expenditure in this field that has led to a rate of increase of almost 5% in the Council’s budget for 2005, while the budgets of the other institutions have increased by a little over 3%. I very much agree that we should ensure transparency and also ensure that no items are entered in this part of the Council’s budget that should properly be part of the action expenditure. I would therefore repeat my appeal to the Council to keep a tighter rein on the budget and to ensure greater transparency. I must emphasise that, from Parliament’s point of view, the expenditure on the common foreign and security policy does not form part of the gentlemen’s agreement. It is obviously an area that we shall discuss further over the next few years. In turn, we in Parliament shall, of course, also keep an eye on our administrative expenditure and continually look to see whether there is scope for savings and increases in efficiency. That is something I believe we owe our taxpayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in previous years, it has not been easy, as he himself has pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not been easy because we have once again had to deal with the funding of new priorities on the basis of the same resources and at the expense of the European Union's traditional foreign action priorities – and I am referring of course to the Balkans, to the policy of neighbourliness, to CFSP actions, to action in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope, Mr President, that a solution can be found to these difficulties which arise every year by revising the financial perspectives so that we do not have to resolve these situations every financial year ‘from hand to mouth’.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fully support the rapporteur's approach of obtaining EUR 190 million in extra funding – and I would like to add that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has asked the Commission to present a report on the application of the democratic clause – and at the same time to intensify action in the field of cooperation with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to repeat Parliament’s demand that the Commission consider creating a bi-regional solidarity fund between the European Union and Latin America which would not involve additional sums.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to join the other Members in offering Commissioner Schreyer our best wishes in the next stage of her life, while not forgetting that Commissioners leave but officials remain. I do not wish to recall the climate of the discussion we have held this morning in Parliament, but I would like to ask you to be very attentive, to take into consideration and not forget the decisions and priorities established by this Parliament as an arm of the Budgetary Authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that, during the last five years, the Commission has appreciably improved reporting on activities in the development area, which is the area with which we work in the committee that I am representing in the House today. A lot remains to be done, especially on developing measurements of results, but progress has undoubtedly been made.</p>
<p class="contents">There is considerable agreement in the committee I represent as to the need for the EU, in its external activities, to give maximum attention to the issues of poverty and the millennium objectives. If this is to be possible, a larger proportion of the budget must, however, give priority to efforts in countries with low incomes. At present, only slightly more than 40% of the money ends up in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore proposed changes to the distribution and, of course, also additions to the Council’s proposals, both to strengthen efforts to combat HIV, malaria and TB, and specifically to allocate more aid to Asia, the region in which far and away the largest number of poor people live. We also propose a new budget item totalling EUR 10 million to enable us to be proactive in efficiently tackling diseases other than HIV, malaria and TB that claim many millions of lives each year, especially among children.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals can only be put into practice if use can be made of the flexibility mechanism. We have no objections whatsoever to contributing to the reconstruction in Iraq. On the contrary. We cannot, however, accept its impairing our long-term efforts to combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Committee on Budgets’ proposals were presented, I have, finally, tabled three amendments at the request of the Committee on Development. They do not involve more money, but are about moving a number of budget items from Title 19 of the budget, External Relations, to Title 21, Development Cooperation. We do not understand why efforts to combat poverty in Asia and Latin America should be given a different heading and position in the budget than corresponding efforts in Africa. The budget should reflect political objectives and not the Commission’s organisational structure. I hope our demands are supported, not only at first, but also at second, reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First we objected to the Council's reductions from the preliminary draft budget in terms of staffing for DG Trade. Given the extent of the talks taking place at WTO level, the number of disputes that now go before the WTO disputes panel and the need to open further external offices of the European Union, we thought that to cut the DG Trade's budget was unacceptable. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Budgets agreed with us and through the global amendment has restored those cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that the Committee on International Trade had concerns about was the need to have a parliamentary forum to follow the work of the WTO. Again we wanted to make sure there was a budget line to finance that parliamentary forum and again the Committee on Budgets agreed with us. So the Committee on International Trade is very happy that the Committee on Budgets has approved, in their entirety, both the amendments we put forward. I hope now that this House will back the Committee on Budgets and that the Council will accept the amendments made by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For 2005, it was completely impossible, as it has been in other years, because, despite the agreement on the financial perspectives in force, the Council’s priorities mean not providing the resources our ambitions require. Respecting our priorities has, therefore, more to do with squaring the books than with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">That has led the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to follow the strategy proposed by our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, whom I thank. This strategy consists of prioritising the policies decided on by Parliament, while calling on the Council to fulfil its commitments in terms of the operation of the agencies, just as for Heading V and the Union’s external policies, where the aid promised for Iran can be funded without difficulty from the sums available from the flexibility instrument of more than EUR 450 million. Only this strategy has allowed us to produce a budget which reflects the very reasonable orientations established by the Socialist Group for the European Union in 2005. With regard to Heading I, we are aware that we are only consulted and, with regard to Headings II and V, which do not raise any great problems today, we have followed the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, by providing this draft budget with such reduced funding and distributing money in a random manner, the Council is expecting us to abandon what we hold most dear in terms of European integration: solidarity. By that I mean solidarity between the peoples of Europe, but also solidarity between Europe and the rest of the world. Without the involvement of the European Parliament, we would have had to choose between the geographical regions benefiting from the Union’s development policy. This is contrary to how we European Socialists view the geographical scope of the Union’s cooperation. We cannot create a hierarchy of suffering, hunger or oppression. We must act in any region we can, and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, when we voted in committee, all the lines dedicated to cooperation were reinforced, regardless of geography. Similarly, we have reinforced the budgetary lines dedicated to the Lisbon strategy, for SMEs, employment and social dialogue. We believe that solidarity means prioritising growth and employment, because solidarity means sharing the fruits of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, our last priority is inspired by European solidarity and consists of making the European Union’s information policy one of our fundamental policies. For the Union to be able to continue its actions, it is urgent that people understand the work it does. Our priority is to make the European Union’s intentions clear and visible. In our societies faced with violence and the spectre of recession, and witnessing the war in Iraq and in the world, the Union must be seen as a model for economic growth based on solidarity. This is the main requirement if we are to combat terrorism and continue to bring peace. Our budget, which we are presenting and on which we will vote on Thursday, must respect our priorities and be our main tool for implementing our political project.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not wish to end without thanking our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, most warmly for the all the work she has done over the last five years. Like Mrs Jensen, I must acknowledge everything she has contributed to the budgetary procedure, to its renewal and modernisation. Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I would like thank you most warmly for what you have done together with us, the European Parliament, over the last five years, and wish you every success in continuing your work of pursuing our Union’s greatest possible democratic well-being.</p>

There were times when he enabled me to keep my good temper. The Committee on Budgets has wanted to simplify matters on a number of scores, which has been at the expense of some amendments tabled by us on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Indeed, the Committee on Budgets has divided all the proposed amendments, that is to say, it has voted <span class="italic">en bloc </span>on the amendments pertaining to agencies and subsequently on everything related to Lisbon, the information strategy and pilot projects. That means that in this <span class="italic">en bloc</span> vote takes as its starting point the obligations and payments for 2004. That is not straightforward, because no consideration has been given to the fact that ten new Member States have joined and that for those ten new Member States new activities need to be developed. For example, Bilbao has been given additional tasks relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is not easy to keep these within the budget of 2004. We at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are therefore not happy with the failure to adopt some of our changes to certain items. We do hope that the amendments tabled by the members of the Socialist Group in the area of social affairs, including our own amendments, will as yet be adopted. Indeed, I would very much like to be able to join with Mr Ferber, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, in once again raising a glass to our future successful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the technical bureau and information that the employees’ organisations have tabled by way of a proposal, we hope to reach agreement again. I would like to thank Mr Ferber, as well as the rapporteur, at this stage for the way in which they are meeting us halfway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are actually very thrifty. Expenditure under the environment heading is not even 0.25% of the European budget, that is, less than a quarter of 1%. In addition, it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want. The same applies, incidentally, to the Health and Consumer Protection DG. And when we hear the word ‘health’ of course we all immediately think ‘tobacco’. That is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We spend more than EUR 950 million on subsidies to tobacco growers. That is more than five and a half times as much as the entire environment budget.

I believe that it is the latest developments – the crisis in the motor industry, the rise in energy prices – that demonstrate the necessity of our gearing the European Budget up for growth, and appropriate communication also has a part to play in this. Over the next five years, we will be devoting much attention to the theme of information policy. We have to do a much better job of explaining Europe. In the run-up to the elections, we could see that there were various elements strategically ganging up on the European Union and on democracy in Europe. I believe that we have the task of explaining to the public what goes on in this place and how important Europe’s position in the world will be for us in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason, too, that we are committed to the infopoints, to the campaign for Europe’s future, to the Carrefours, to Prince, to all these important things, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to explain it.

I, too, will gladly do my bit towards our becoming the most modern parliament in the world, even though my contribution, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, will be a modest one. In considering the Budget, we set clear priorities, particularly with regard to the Lisbon agenda. Concrete initiatives to push forward the Lisbon agenda, including in this Budget procedure, are more important than a constant succession of statements, whether by the Heads of State and Government, or sometimes by us ourselves, that cost those who make them nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We still regard the internal market as being at the heart of our competition strategy, and, seeing as there has been no change in the obstacles to it, we have proposed allocating funds to the holding of another forum on the internal market in order to discuss the various minor obstacles remaining in the internal market with those who are affected by them, thus enabling us to fashion forward-looking legislative instruments to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Internal Market Committee also regard the eastward enlargement as potentially crucial in promoting growth, prosperity and employment, but we do of course also see that there are still difficulties involved in getting economies to grow together across borders. For that reason, we are proposing a pilot project for the formation of clusters in the border regions, through which strategic alliances can be forged. We also regard the internal market for consumers as still having considerable potential for enhancing our competitiveness and have, to this end, allocated funds for the fields of food safety and the combating of diseases in animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself would also like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Schreyer for her cooperation. It is a fact of life that those responsible for the Budget may make a lot of enemies and annoy a lot of people, but they also make some friends. When it comes to the border regions, though, they have become friends, as has the rapporteur on our Budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, and for that many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same is true of us as of the other committees: sometimes our expectations are greater than the funds available to us, and that is why, rather than setting new priorities, we have tried at least to allocate the necessary funds to what has been agreed jointly by the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so that the public can have confidence that what you announce will then be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to give three examples of this, and one thing they relate to is safety and the environment. Frequent reference has been made to the agencies in this debate. We do not take a sympathetic view, when, for example, the three partners come to a clear consensus on policies on railway safety, safety in the air and the combating of marine pollution, and then along comes the Council and reduces the funds for these to nothing. When that happens, we are no longer talking in terms of technical decisions about finance, but about policy decisions on the Budget. I think the indications from the Transport Committee have been very clear, namely that we have to make the funds available at least for our shared policy objectives, particularly when it is the environment and safety that are at stake. We are familiar with the problems of transport, which affect us internationally, nationally, and also locally. The public expect more than just crisis management; they expect signs, and a sustainable policy in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and I regard this as having been very important – we also give priority to the trans-European networks. We must not forget that there are now 25 of us, rather than 15. We were realistic in our estimates of the expenditure authorisations, bearing in mind the current situation and the Commission’s depiction of it. Although we know that there is no point in providing money in excess of the projects currently being tackled, we also want to send a message to the effect that we aspire to planning, in future, a trans-European network including the 25 countries and more besides, and the new countries, who are represented in this House, expect the same priorities to be set.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobility and transport fall between the economy, safety and the environment and affect all the citizens who want to live together in Europe. For that reason I would like to see good financial provision made for these well-known priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as Structural Funds and regional policy are concerned, there are three prominent aspects of the 2005 Budget procedure to be noted.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that 2005 is the first complete financial year for the Europe of Twenty-Five. Secondly, and in consequence of that, it is only right that the overall funds available in the preliminary draft Budget for regional policy were increased, the payment appropriations to a greater extent than the commitment appropriations, where the increase was more modest. Thirdly, the way in which the funds have been appropriated makes it clear that, in the case of eight new Member States, there is a continuing transition from the pre-accession instruments to support being given from the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has made cuts in the preliminary draft Budget that we regard as unacceptable. In the Budget procedure, the Committee on Regional Development has done no more than avail itself of its right to use amendments as a means of restoring the amounts cut by the Council – with reference, of course, to the Budget expenditure as a whole. To sum up, every one of the amendments we called for and adopted provides only for the restoration of the Budget line to what it was in the preliminary draft Budget, thereby preventing the regional policy budget from being cut. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amendments have moved in the general direction for the agricultural budget of re-establishing the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission, because the Council had cut it in an arbitrary manner, using saving as their only criterion and without taking account of the different agricultural items.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the increase in aid to young European farmers and I would like to point out once again that the average age of a European farmer is over 50 and that henceforth this is the biggest problem facing European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I wish to reject the proposed cut to aid for tobacco, reminding all of you that this issue has already been debated in this House and that we decided on a cut of 50% from 2010 and that from 2006 the cut should begin in a modulated fashion from a minimum of 40%, and the debate was therefore settled at that point, to the satisfaction of the opponents of tobacco cultivation. I therefore do not believe we should return to this issue during the current budgetary debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I also believe there is no place for Amendment No 285, which opposes aid to cattle rearing, because there is no legal basis for combating cattle rearing and this would therefore create discrimination. If we want to open a debate on that, it will have to be about bull-fighting: this aid is not for Spain’s national fiesta.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the cuts to aid for exports, and particularly for exports of beef, I believe that the COM is still open and the Doha round will tell us what the solution must be when it closes. This is not, therefore, the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What have been the essential objectives of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries? Firstly, to reincorporate the appropriations unjustifiably cut by the Council from the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission in relation to two important issues: international fisheries agreements in relation to cuts of payments from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance. Secondly, there has been an amendment, also accepted by the Committee on Budgets, relating to the new Community agency for fisheries control, in which this Parliament has shown great interest and which requires a contribution so that it can be implemented urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to insist on two amendments, which have been rejected by the Committee on Budgets, and which I would like to present once again. They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99. The first, relating to the regional advisory councils, and the second, relating to the increase in aid for improving scientific information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the fisheries advisory councils have been the great innovation of the reform and the only instrument we have for ensuring the participation of the sector in the decision-making process. This Parliament's objective is for all the councils provided for in the Community legislation to be operational during next year and in order to achieve this, we need an increase of some EUR 500 000.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second case, relating to improving scientific information, neither the Council nor the Commission have provided for an increase on last year. Neither does the Sixth Framework Research Programme provide for anything. We believe that a budget of EUR 1.5 million for this issue is not too much to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that we, unlike other committees, have only proposed an increase of EUR 3 million compared to the preliminary draft budget; I would therefore ask you to support the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, it is not fortuitous that all the members of the Culture Committee took the view that we had to reject the Council’s reduction in funds for cultural policy, for there can be no credible cultural policy in a Europe of 25 Member States if the funds for it are cut in 2005, the first year in which there is a single Budget for all of them. For that reason members of the Culture Committee, from whatever political groups they came, demanded above all the restoration of the Commission’s Budget estimates for town twinning and information policy, in order to gain the public’s acceptance, as also for the youth programmes. These in particular are the areas affecting the public. We should do something to show that, in the cultural field too, we are prepared to take up the cudgels for this wonderful Europe of ours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The point to which I want to draw attention is extraordinarily significant, quite simply because it is the only one, and it is that the Legal Affairs Committee’s remit includes the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The public often complain that proceedings in them often take a very long time and that decisions are taken only at a very late stage in them; this often happens when they deal with matters of great public importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it quite clear that the reason for this is not to be found with the judges but elsewhere, namely in the inadequate capacity for translating documentation and forms. If we were, by means of this Budget, to succeed in making an appropriate contribution to adapting the ECJ’s equipment to current circumstances and requirements, that would be a great triumph, and one that would benefit the many members of the European public who have recourse to the law to resolve their disputes. Finally, there is no doubt that the ECJ plays an outstanding part in the further development and integration of Europe, and so I think it appropriate that it should be properly equipped to enable it to do justice to its task.</p>
<p class="contents">If this Budget helps to do this, we in the Legal Affairs Committee will be content, for then an essential objective will have been achieved. Even if not everything can be completed this year, it will be a step in the right direction if there is continuous development towards this end. That concludes my statement on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight four of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, following the Fourniret affair, which has recently shaken Belgium and France, we have provided for a new budgetary line to allow the Commission to make proposals with a view to organising the interconnection of national registers of criminal convictions for crimes such as paedophilia, sexual assault and serious crimes committed by repeat offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the visa information system, commonly know as the VIS, we have put most of the appropriations in reserve, and they will not be released until the Commission has presented a second proposal precisely defining the architecture and functioning of the VIS system itself, as it has said it will. This is a delicate area in terms of the protection of personal information.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to the Agency for the management of external borders, we have placed all the appropriations in reserve. It is not that we question the importance of that agency and the need to make it operational as quickly as possible, quite the opposite, but we shall release the appropriations in reserve when the Council has made the decision on the final headquarters of the agency. We call on the Council to give its opinion before the end of this year. If this is a strategic agency, it cannot be content with a provisional headquarters with all the costs and operational inconvenience that would entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have also put in reserve most of the appropriations requested for the line relating to the rights of passengers. We all know the differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission on this, with regard to the level of protection for the personal information which airlines must communicate to the American customs authorities. The Commission has promised on several occasions that the current passive system for communicating data, the PULL system, would be replaced with an active system, the PUSH system. So far, the Commission has done nothing. The appropriations will be released when the Commission has fulfilled its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I must end by mentioning a final amendment which the Committee on Budgets has unfortunately not retained, to my regret. It concerns the Commission's desire to launch a preparatory action in the field of managing the return of immigrants who are not authorised to remain in Union territory. Of course it is desirable and urgent to organise better cooperation amongst the Member States in this field, but it must be done according to rules, and in a preparatory action there are no rules. In accordance with Declaration 5, annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Heads of State or Government have formally been calling on the Council to rule on this issue since 1 May 2004, pursuant to the procedure laid down in Article 251, that is to say, qualified majority and codecision. The Council has done nothing, ignoring the will of the Heads of Government and the rights of Parliament. I would like the Council’s institutional infringement to be penalised, in accordance with Amendment No 146 presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very simple. First of all, we wanted to re-establish what the Council had taken away: I am referring in particular to the budget lines relating to the information relays or the Jean Monnet action programme. It was, however, when we came to the Prince programme in particular that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs had to pinch itself to see if it had really understood the figures before its eyes. We were amazed to discover that the Commission had divided the sum for 2004 by three at a time when we are about to enter the decisive stage in the public debate on the Constitution. Was it really possible that it had escaped the Commission’s attention that a debate on the Constitutional Treaty was going to start on 18 June? The Council, however, had no such excuse, since the Council knew in the summer that a draft Constitution was on the table and that it was essential that it be debated. That is why our committee is not content simply with re-establishing this budget line, but wishes to multiply the figure proposed by the Commission by five, raising it to seven and a half million. Democracy does not have a price but it does have a cost, and I hope that the Council will finally understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">As my fellow Members have done, I would like to end by congratulating our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, on the excellent work she has done over the last five years with this Parliament, and on another more personal note, I would like to express my hope, my dear Michaele, that tomorrow, on the turn of a vote, your mandate will be extended by a few weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As our committee does not have that many Budget lines to administer, this horizontal policy is of particular importance to us. I have to say, however, that I agree with Mr Prodi’s assessment that successes have not been conclusive everywhere. As with the Lisbon strategy, we have given gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming a fixed place in the Structural Funds, but, at the end of the day, only 6% goes to gender-centred projects. Hence it has been our great concern that the amendments should be used to achieve progress in this area by laying down minimum margins in the major programmes, in MEDA, in the major cooperation programmes, including those with other countries, in aid for Afghanistan and for Iraq. It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets was unwilling to go down this road; it stated that part of these sums was to be used for gender-centred projects, but actually lacked the courage for this. If we really want change, minimum rates must be laid down. I think more debate on this is called for, and we need to muster the courage to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Committee on Women’s Rights does have competences is in the field of gender mainstreaming under the Framework Programme, but it is again and again becoming apparent to us that we lack reliable data on how EU funds are spent on women and on men. It is therefore very important that we should get the gender institute started. Although the Council has voted in favour of the idea, the whole thing is meant to be run in a budget-neutral way, in other words, it is not allowed to cost anything, and women are allowed to do as they like if it does not. That is not acceptable, so what we want is to introduce at least a token entry for the gender institute.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention a project from the DAPHNE programme, that being the European Year against Violence against Women. Many approaches have been made to the Commission seeking its support for this, but if you want something done, you do it yourself, so let us declare the ‘Year against Violence’! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first speech to this House as a member of the European Commission five years ago was, of course, about the 2000 Budget. It was a Budget for only 15 Member States, for a Union of only 375 million people. It was in that Budget that pre-accession aid was adopted for the first time, from which funds flowed to six states with which negotiations were in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">What I expect to be my last speech to this House has to do with the first Budget for a European Union with 25 Member States. That sums up the historic change that we have brought about in those five years. Not one day goes past when I do not rejoice that we have managed to overcome the division of Europe, and that now, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, policies can be made for a Union of 450 million people. What a great development!</p>
<p class="contents">The European Budget has also become steadily more important and an important tool for European policy. For that reason, it must be solid; it must be developed within a reliable framework; it must be set out transparently and implemented efficiently. I am glad that, in these five years, we have managed to reform and modernise the Budget procedure as a whole – not only in drawing up a now more political Budget, but also in structuring one that is activity-based.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budget itself has become more political. The new Budget Regulation and the reformed accounting system were major feats of strength on the part of all the institutions together – Parliament, Commission, Council, and the Court of Auditors as well. I would like to extend very, very warm thanks for these great shared efforts and for this very efficient cooperation, particularly of course to the members of the Committee on Budgets, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and to the members of the Council’s Budget Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It was another feat of strength on the part of the Budget Committee to package, process and prioritise the many amendments tabled by Members to the Budget for 2005, and I compliment the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, who has drafted this report and the many amendments to it with the sure-footedness of one who is very experienced in budgeting. Congratulations on this achievement!</p>
<p class="contents">My compliments also to the new chairman of the Committee on Budgets. It is always a very difficult task to take over such an important and difficult task in the midst of a Budget procedure. The committee under your chairmanship is also a very fine one, with very fine members.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, Budgets have been at their lowest in the recent history of their kind in the European Union. As Commissioner for the Budget, I am very proud of the fact, for it shows that we are working in strict accordance with the principles of budgetary discipline, but the relative reduction in recent years’ budgets was intended to make room for the taking on of new tasks, in particular of expenditure destined for the new Member States, which they will indeed receive.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000, the current Financial Perspective, made provision for this. The Financial Perspective makes corresponding provision for the 2005 Budget to have an upper limit of EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations, equivalent to 1.14% of the gross national income of the Union of Fifteen, and we always have to remind ourselves of that when considering what the Financial Perspective should be like in the future. According to all the institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – the 2005 Budget requires at least EUR 116 billion in commitment appropriations. The three institutions’ proposals for commitment appropriations differ only very slightly. Why is this so? It is, of course, because there is very little room for manoeuvre, as so much was laid down both by Agenda 2000 and in the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a great disparity in the estimates of the actual amount to be spent or paid next year. It does, of course, depend on what is being estimated, and on how much is to be taken up. We have to be serious about ensuring that voting commitment appropriations actually results in the money being paid out in succeeding years, and so the Commission cannot in fact support the cuts that the Council has proposed in this area. We are grateful to your House for insisting that at least the funds we proposed must be reinstated, and indeed, for proposing an increase in them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking specifically here about the take-up of funds from the Structural Funds. All the parties concerned have joined together over recent years in making an effort to improve implementation, and now we have succeeded, in that, this year, take-up of funds is much improved in comparison with what it had been in the past. For this year, then, we have applied for an additional EUR 2 billion as means of payment for the Structural Funds, as there is demand for them on the part of the Member States. We can therefore safely work on the assumption that implementation will work very well next year too.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to personnel issues and to administrative expenditure. 2005 will be the second year of the enlarged EU, and the Commission is asking for a second <span class="italic">tranche</span> of additional staff in order to be able to handle the greater requirements of an enlarged Union. Mrs Jensen noted that the Council is awarding itself a far greater increase in administrative expenditure than it is allowing to the other institutions. To you too, Mrs Jensen, I would like to express my congratulations on your work; being the rapporteur for all the other institutions makes all kinds of demands on you.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank your House for accepting the 700 posts that the Commission had requested, but you can well imagine that I am not equally enthusiastic to learn that you are saying that 150 of them should be put in reserve in the first instance. It goes without saying that it is one of Parliament’s important duties to constantly monitor what is done with these posts and whether the right priorities are being set for their use, but I would like to argue in favour of the imposition of conditions on the release of the reserve that can actually be met in future. We do of course know that the whole recruitment process will take time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, on behalf of the Prodi Commission, like to thank Parliament for always having approved the increases in posts for which we asked, for you are of course aware that increased expectations cannot be met without the resources to do so being in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout all these years, it was the foreign policy section of the Budget that was under the greatest pressure; this was partly in consequence of events around the world and also because the European Union has actually started to take more joint responsibility, and the resources have to be provided for it to do so. This was in part facilitated only by drawing on the flexibility reserve. Likewise, in 2005, it is highly probable that we will find it impossible to manage the foreign policy budget without having recourse to funds from the flexibility reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The letter of amendment that you have received from the Commission in respect of the 2005 Budget frees up funds in the foreign policy sphere and in the foreign budget, and so we are able to propose that support grants for Croatia be made in future out of Category 7, as accession negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year. We have also proposed that economic aid to the Turkish Cypriot community be funded from the category for pre-accession aid. It is gratifying to learn that the Council has now decided to treat this financial package as additional. I would ask your House to treat this proposal as a matter of great urgency and endorse the aid that we are proposing for the Turkish part of Cyprus. In so doing, we should also be aiming to help both communities to arrive at a final solution to the division of Cyprus and to overcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a request from the Council, the Commission also proposes, as part of the 2005 Budget, the continuation of the PEACE programme for Northern Ireland for another two years. Although this, too, is a sensible course of action, let me observe, as regards the last three points I have mentioned, that it was always the Council that made the request, and always had very good reasons of policy for doing so. I must remind you, though, that resolutions at lofty summits, right though they are in policy terms, must always be followed by Budget resolutions laboriously hammered out on the down-to-earth environment of the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In comparison with the current year, we will see the greatest increase in the 2005 Budget in the agricultural budget, which will rise from EUR 44 billion to EUR 50 billion next year. There are important and good reasons for this. Firstly, this will be the first time that the Budget includes direct grants to farmers in the new Member States. Secondly, the exchange rate is higher than it was. Thirdly, there have been agricultural reforms decided on by the Council, which have resulted in increased – rather than reduced – outgoings. Taking everything into consideration, then, the agricultural budget will next year require 0.48% of each Member State’s gross national income, and nearly 45% of the total European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this structure, with its bias towards the agricultural sector, has its own history and sound reasoning behind it, we have to ask ourselves the simple question as to whether this structure is appropriate to the challenges of the future, or whether we need to set other priorities for the future and for the next Financial Perspective. One of these priorities will of course be to achieve the Lisbon targets, and all must be called on to help do this. Targets have been set, they have been agreed to by all, and either we take seriously these targets that have been set or we do not. If, though, we take them seriously, more must in future be made available from the European Budget for such investments in the future as research, education and innovation. This is a quite crucial challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent from some of the debates among the Member States at Council level that the Member States are advocating a future reduction of the Budget to 1% of gross national income, expressed as commitment appropriations, which would mean that the absolute level for the 2005 Budget would be perpetuated in the future. If, at the same time, agricultural expenditure were to be included in this area on a permanent basis, it would mean that little of the structure would change in future, but the European Union will not be capable of mastering the tasks and challenges of the future with a structure from the past. A change is therefore needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Before you lie difficult negotiations; there have been others in the past, but what must be given attention is the discrepancy between what the European public have been promised and what is actually done later; it must not be allowed to grow, or else Europe will be a cause of frustration and disappointment. We are all endeavouring to ensure that this does not happen, and that the European Budget will instead have a structure appropriate to the demands of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I now hope that the European Parliament, the European Council and the future Commission will take very wise decisions, not only in relation to the Budget for 2005, but also, and in particular, to the next Financial Perspective. I hope that the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in matters relating to the Budget will continue to be as good as it has been over the last five years.</p>

<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group considers the Council’s approach, which implements reductions of 1.5% in the expenditure of other European Union institutions but does not apply the same reduction to its own budget, to be unjustified. Our group supports austerity measures with respect to administrative expenditure and supports maximum efficiency in the use of European Union budgetary funds, and the elimination of wasteful expenditure and of duplication of functions between European Union institutions. We consider that such an approach should be applied to all European Union institutions, including the Council and the European Parliament. That is why the PPE-DE Group has, for example, repeatedly moved motions calling for a reduction of the European Parliament’s expenditure to below the traditional ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the enlargement of the European Union has caused the European Union’s budgetary expenditure to increase. The PPE-DE Group is in favour of providing the means necessary for satisfying the requirements arising from the enlargement of the European Union. That also applies to administrative expenses and new staff posts. However, the PPE-DE Group considers the creation of new posts to be permissible only on submission of a clear and comprehensive justification of the need for such posts. The same principle applies to supplementary budget requests connected to the introduction of the new Financial Regulation and the new Staff Regulations in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The proportion of total expenditure that is represented by administrative expenses is one of the indicators in evaluating the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union. An unwieldy and costly administration reduces that effectiveness. Our task and that of all other European institutions is to strive to increase the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on fellow Members of the European Parliament to support the PPE-DE Group’s stance in voting on the 2005 budget for the other institutions of the European Union and to remember that we also bear on our shoulders responsibility to ensure the most efficient use of European Union taxpayers’ money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past five years, I have been able, as spokesman of my group, to work closely with her, and I can say that I have the greatest respect for her and for the work she has done, for hers is not an easy portfolio, and she has not always had the steady support of those around her; on the contrary, she has often had to make a very great effort, and that is why we respect her so highly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also pay tribute to my two fellow-Members who are now this House’s rapporteurs – Mr Salvador Garriga Polledo, and Mrs Anne Jensen in particular, who took over the work of rapporteur only a month ago. Making such a good job of it without preparation is remarkable in itself, and so every respect to her.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budget before us is not some sort of abstract entity with nothing but figures floating around in it; on the contrary, it reflects the sort of policies we want to make and on which we have decided; it reflects how we want the European Union to further develop, and what we want it to be like. At the same time, we must always bear in mind that it is the taxpayer’s money that we are spending, and we are obliged to be very careful in what we do with it. It can, I think, be said that this House has, over recent years, been a very careful steward of the European taxpayers’ resources. If the impression is communicated every year during the Budget debate that Parliament wants more to be spent while the Council, representing the governments, always wants to cut outgoings, that amounts only to fake frugality on the part of the Council. This, I believe, is where we have to ensure that the funds we need to make the policies that we want to happen are actually available. Let me clarify that by using two or three examples. Over past years, we have again and again seen the categories narrowed down. It has just been said that Category 4 has become more and more restrictive. Commissioner Schreyer rightly pointed out that Category 4 used to include not only foreign policy, but also Afghanistan, Iraq and the Balkans as well. All these things were to be paid for using the same funds. The Council wanted more to be spent on its common foreign and security policy, but the things we wanted, it cut – such things, for example, as funds that would have been made available for democratisation or for conflict prevention. That is just not on! You cannot fund what you are promising for the future with money for promises made in the past; it merely baffles the public, who no longer have any clear idea of what the European Union actually stands for. This we will not go along with, and we will keep on telling uncomfortable truths.</p>
<p class="contents">In the other field, that of internal policy, which has also just been mentioned, we have created several extra agencies. These agencies exist to perform administrative tasks, but they are introduced into a portfolio with which we want to make internal policies, environmental policy, policies on research, development, and education. All these things are crammed in on top. Additional tasks are transferred and the whole thing is rubber-stamped by the Council, which then comes to us and tells us that we must be more careful with money! We will tighten our belts, even in this Budget procedure. We will look to see exactly what we need. In this Budget procedure, then, we will take up our positions, exert our influence successfully, and make it clear to the public that what we have announced in the past we will stick to and make happen. There will be no blank cheques handed out, neither in the 2005 Budget procedure, nor when it comes to the future funding of the European Union. You can expect this House to stand firm; we will tell people what is needed and also where we can make savings.</p>

<p class="contents">It has been a weighty and onerous task, but both rapporteurs have carried it out extremely well. I also wish to thank the new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, for his skilful leadership of the committee. I would like to say a special thank you, however, to Commissioner Schreyer for the outstanding degree of cooperation she has shown, not just this year, but across the whole five-year period of the last Parliamentary term. Under your leadership, the EU budgets have been produced and the legal basis for them revised. The structure of the budget has been amended, the Financial Regulation and the rules for its implementation have been revised, and the accounts system is being reformed as we speak. I would like to thank her warmly for her excellent level of cooperation and wish her every success for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget for 2005 aims to foster economic growth. The special areas of focus in the committee’s proposal are the enhancement of economic cohesion and the creation of employment, and we believe they are the correct ones. One aim is to safeguard EU agriculture prior to the massive reform which will take place. Accordingly, the committee has restored approximately one billion euros of the cuts that the Council had made. It is particularly important to reduce transportation of livestock step by step, and to this end the committee has set aside 10% of the appropriations for further research. The committee has proposed an additional EUR 40 million for the prevention of animal diseases. This has been one of my group’s main areas of focus. The Structural Funds are an important instrument for job creation, and so it was right of the committee to endorse the sum of EUR 3.8 billion in payment appropriations. In this way, we can speed up the implementation of programmes, and at the same time reduce outstanding commitments, which have grown to a sum equivalent to approximately two years of appropriations. This is a threat to structural policy in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of entrepreneurial activity has been a particular area of focus. It has been crucial to validate the relevant budget headings and to strengthen support for small and medium-sized businesses as well as research and training programmes. My group backs these proposals. Likewise, the areas of focus are in harmony with the new financial perspectives, as these also aim to enhance EU competitiveness by endorsing these items of expenditure. The proposal before us, possibly in amended form, will be Parliament’s first chance to present its view of next year’s budget. Hopefully, the budget will be approved, by December, in a positive spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add, with reference to Green policy on women, that I am very proud and glad that you have represented us in this allegedly tough area of politics in recent years, and with such courage and decisiveness, such openness to dialogue and such competence. That was a tremendous success for us Greens, and also for the European Union as a whole. In that I take pride, and I wish you all the best for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also been courageous enough to raise the question of for how long budget policy can be structured in the way it is. In the very same way as the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, you have today made it clear that budget policy is pre-eminently a political task, that not only do we have to handle columns of figures, but we also have to express the priorities of what we are endeavouring to do politically and hence also our political self-conception in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by emphasising that we generally endorse the broad outlines of what our rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, has said, and by following a number of the previous speakers in illustrating this by reference to a number of policy areas. Things are improving in the field of structural policy, which is being better implemented, and which is about solidarity and real cohesion in Europe, and about reducing the differences in standards of living. Now that it is working better, it is self-evident that we must allocate more money to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Walter has just pointed out that, as an increase in their number was what we wanted, the Council must be willing to make new funds available to the new agencies, for we cannot allow the policy of decentralised agencies to result in a price war in European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to highlight – and on this I very much agree with many of the positions expressed by the specialist committees – is that we have to attach greater importance to information policy. Only if we communicate what we are trying to do to people where they actually are, and only if we are really pro-active in promoting the Constitution over the coming months, will we be able to win the people of Europe over to the European project, which makes political sense. A majority in our group supports precisely this approach, which involves making work on Europe more transparent and going into battle for Europe’s cause.</p>
<p class="contents">You then spoke about foreign policy; here, too, we take the view that we must press on with the reconstruction of Iraq with real determination. That will not, however, be possible with the present structure of the Budget, so we will have to make use of the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress something that Mr Garriga Polledo said, that this House and the Committee on Budgets possess the political will to counteract terrorism, the fundamentalism that strengthens it, and totalitarian thinking. Whilst endorsing this approach in principle, we do believe that we absolutely need to fight for specific measures that really make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me observe that everyone in this House is constantly talking about the Lisbon strategy. We, too, think this right and proper, but it is evident that some Members are talking about different aspects of it. We are convinced in our heart of hearts that growth policy may not be separated from sustainable growth. Green thinking and measures to protect the environment can add up, too. That, and not reverting to the mindset of the 1960s by again treating the economy and the environment as separate, is the truly modern policy for the economy and for innovation. With that in mind, I hope that we will be able to arrive at compromises with the members of the other groups in the forthcoming discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding next year’s budget, it has to be said that our group’s opinion of it varies considerably. Many of the representatives of countries classified as net contributors support the Council’s stringent 1% line. The majority of our group, however, think the budget is too stringent, as the priorities highlighted by Parliament are not being implemented, especially in the area of external relations. Of the priorities set out by the rapporteur for the Commission’s budget, we support the idea of highlighting the importance of the Lisbon Strategy, but we regret that the large parliamentary groups were unwilling to increase funding in areas relating to employment and social welfare. Business is setting the terms for the way we proceed to too great an extent.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects to consider with regard to increasing appropriations for information. More money is being proposed for campaigns in favour of the new Constitution of the European Union. It is our experience that both the Commission and Parliament are channelling these funds for purposes of propaganda, and are trying to influence the final result of the referenda in the Member States. Money set aside for information on the EU is all too often used for persuasive advertising, without presenting all the sides of an issue. This is not justified, especially as far as the issue of the Constitution is concerned, as that currently falls exclusively within the competence of the Member States, and not at all within that of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parties in our group do not constitute a common European political party. Not all parties on the left wish to restrict their freedom of action with some sort of rigid party line or enforced solidarity at Union level. Some members of our group therefore take a dim view of parliamentary funds being spent on supporting European political parties. There would seem to be more sympathy for increasing funding for the salaries of assistants. We await with interest the negotiations between Parliament and the Council for the second reading of the budget. The margins that are now being created are not sufficient to cover the priorities of both the Council and Parliament, and both have to make compromises on their objectives. Our group will adopt a final position on the draft budget when we see the outcome of the talks that are now commencing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is of a formal and political nature. The draft budget for 2005 was drawn up at a time when it was assumed that Poland and nine other countries would become EU Member States, yet the draft was not discussed or drawn up with these countries. In Polish politics there is a principle according to which ‘nothing about us without us’ should ever be done. A failure to hold consultations demonstrates a lack of equality and a lack of respect for one’s partner. The second reason relates to substance. There are two issues upon which the EU should focus. These are firstly, the enlargement to include ten new countries, and, secondly, the slow-down in economic growth within the EU, particularly in comparison with South-Eastern Asia and the United States. The new Member States are characterised by low levels of wealth, backward economic structures, a lack of capital and extremely high levels of unemployment. The acceptance of these countries into the European Union should act as a catalyst for a change in EU economic policy to ensure that the backwardness I referred to is eliminated as quickly as possible. The draft 2005 budget is not a good response to this challenge, as it only represents 1.03% of countries’ GDP, and the amount by which budget expenditure will grow will not be much greater than the contributions paid in by the new Member States. As in previous years, a budget surplus can be anticipated, because it is likely that not all the money in the Structural Funds will be spent. This will mean that the new Member States, instead of receiving more from the budget than they pay in, will become net payers. I called for the 2004 budget surplus of EUR 5470 million to be earmarked for a fund to modernise the new Member States, but this did not happen. The Structural Funds will be increased, but only by a small amount. This is too slow a tempo, in view of the fact that consumption levels in the new Member States are often ten times lower than those in the old Member States. A little over EUR 1.4 billion is to be earmarked for direct aid to farmers in the new Member States. In a situation such as that in Poland, where the EU imposed significant restrictions on the majority of producers, aid cannot compensate for these losses. If it wishes to overcome its problems, the EU must understand that investment in the new Member States would be the most effective form of investment. If there is not such investment, the whole of the EU will face increasing economic and social problems, which is not what we want. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to add my voice to those thanking Mrs Schreyer for her many years of work on the EU budget. I should also like to say on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that in principle we accept the strategy whereby Parliament reinstates the budget figures suggested by the Commission and reduced by the Council. The majority of the members of the UEN Group would of course gladly see a more striking increase in these figures, in particular those under Heading 2, but as a Polish pop song says, ‘when you don’t have what you love, you should love what you have’. We welcome the increase in funding for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and for information policy. At the same time, however, we would like to stress that funding for information campaigns relating to the referendums on the Constitutional Treaty must not be spent merely on propaganda for the Treaty. An equal amount must be spent on critical media coverage. We must respect public opinion in our countries, and public opinion is very divided on this issue. We welcome the reinstatement of funding for programmes under the budget line covering TACIS and MEDA, which are of particular interest to our group. We are, however, concerned at the ambiguous position adopted by the Committee on Budgets with regard to our amendment. This amendment relates to a ban on the provision of Community aid to projects in third countries that could result in the carrying out of forced abortions, sterilisation or female circumcision. It is an amendment aimed at protecting human rights. In order to ensure that the right to choose is a genuine right, and not a mere mockery of the phrase, we call for this House to vote in favour of our amendment, Amendment No 5. This does not, of course, change the fact that in principle the UEN Group supports the draft 2005 budget in the version put forward by the Committee on Budgets, and will vote in favour of this draft at its first reading. At the same time, however, we hope that in future years the EU budget will be increased in order to allow the EU to achieve the ambitious tasks it has set itself. We have in mind in particular the rapid development, or development demands, of the new Member States, given that the development of these countries, and the acceleration of their development, will be to the benefit of the EU as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth remembering that approximately 90% of the budgetary resources comes from the base of gross national income and from resources derived from income from Value Added Tax, and that these resources are closely related to the pace of economic growth. </p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, stated that 2003 was accompanied by sluggish growth of just 0.5% of GDP. He also stated that, at present, the world economy is recording its strongest growth in the last 30 years, and that the European Union should be exploiting this positive global environment. </p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget plan totally fails to respond to these realities, however. In 2004, a provisional growth of 7.9% in the amounts of commitments paid is expected in relation to 2003. This is based on the latest figures, taking into account trends in July or August. In comparison with this, and in spite of the advised favourable growth environment, the draft European Union budget allows for an increase of just 5.4% compared to 2003, which means that the year on year growth in funds paid out should be 30% lower than in 2004. Moreover, unlike the budget for 2004, the EU budget for 2005 now has to reflect a full year’s membership of the ten new Member States. From this point of view, the starting-point parameters as set by the Council and in principle accepted by the Commission are, from the developmental point of view, both cosy and restrictive, and will present considerable problems in the implementation of the basic structural, regional and solidarity policies of the EU.

Back at the beginning, when we had negotiations and Agenda 2000, those years were not easy. Nor were they easy when it came to bringing together the various aspirations and drawing up a single European Budget. Let me very warmly thank you for your cooperation, which has been marked by a high degree of trust, and I of course wish you speedy resumption of your work at the Free University of Berlin in the winter semester, in other words that, if a new Commission takes office tomorrow, the burden of European labours will be lifted from your shoulders and you will again be able to completely devote yourself to your research.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also thank both the rapporteurs, who have managed, under conditions that have not exactly been easy, to put together a very decent package. That is what we have to discuss among ourselves today – where it is that Europe can become visible, where we can create added European value that gives people visible evidence of where our priorities lie, and where Europe makes a contribution to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Lisbon strategy, let me say quite plainly that I find myself wondering whether this strategy for establishing a competitive economy throughout Europe is just a matter of redistribution by way of the European Budget, or whether certain Member States have particular tasks to perform; I am thinking in particular, Commissioner, of the country from which both you and I come and in which your party shares in the responsibilities of government. Might we not do much more for Europe’s competitiveness if structures were to be broken up, thereby helping to create real growth?</p>
<p class="contents">It should not, therefore, be said only that Lisbon means using the European Budget as a roundabout way of distributing more money among the people. We have to begin by making the necessary reforms possible at ground level. There have already been many proposals relating to this from both Lisbon and the German Government, and I would like to see them put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">To move on to the Budget, though, the past five years have seen the administrative apparatus of the European Union expand as never before, something that has to do not only with enlargement, but also with the Council’s inventiveness in extending administration in the shape of the agencies. Like Mr Walter, I wonder whether we are paying for all this out of the policy sections of the budget, where it does not belong in the first place, or whether the Council is at last willing to include it under the heading of administrative expenditure?</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to foreign policy, I am fed up with the foreign ministers wandering the earth doling out money, and us then being supposed, again and again, to give the new priorities budgetary form, a task which is far from simple. That, too, has been mentioned, and, as the old priorities have become irrelevant, we have opted for a tough approach to the Budget, and I hope we will get out of the Council some sensible results that will help, not only to make this Europe of ours visible, but also to make savings where it really is possible to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time when this House was approving the current financial perspectives, we were perfectly aware that certain headings were insufficient to cover the needs we already knew about in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 4, ‘External Actions’ is an excellent example. It was created without sufficient resources, without the resources necessary to implement the aid to Kosovo, and every year the Union has committed itself to special interventions in certain parts of the world, as Mr Ferber has also pointed out: Kosovo, the former Yugoslavian republics, Afghanistan, and, recently, Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing was provided for in the figures in May 1999, and unexpected revisions have been required every year. This Parliament has had to accept some of the cuts to its traditional policies proposed by the Council. After five budgetary years, these cuts amount to a very significant sum for a development aid policy which is diminishing in relative terms, while we are constantly saying that we want a Europe which is open to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that our Parliament was able to increase the Berlin figures for administrative spending in Category 5, we have been faced with budgetary restrictions which I believe have led to increased inefficiency in the Commission's work. Nevertheless, the Council does not hesitate to call for austerity in administrative spending, while awarding itself substantial annual increases.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the problems which were already becoming obvious in Heading 3, ‘Internal Actions’, have finally come to a head. I am not going to repeat what has been said here about the Agencies; we completely and utterly agree with this, but we want the resources necessary to fund them. Furthermore, over this period we have used the so-called flexibility instrument, even going as far as to revise the ceiling of Heading 2. None of this is good enough, ladies and gentlemen of the Council. Of course there should be budgetary discipline and rigour, but what you have been doing over the last five years is not an example of rigour but rather of shoddiness.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing spending by hundreds of millions of euros is not, in this case, a saving, but rather a short-sighted exercise in accountancy. You create new priorities but, in order to put them into practice, you sacrifice some of the existing priorities, based on the principle of not exceeding a certain spending limit. This is not politics, but accountancy. And I believe that politicians can provide more solutions to the problems faced by our society than accountants <span class="bold">–</span> and I say this with every respect for accountants.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the new financial perspectives, I hope that the Council will change its attitude, that it will take a wider view and realise that the Union’s budgetary policy faces much more important challenges than keeping spending below a particular percentage of gross domestic product, which would appear to be the only objective the Council is actually sure of.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Schreyer, I would naturally like to join in all the thanks for your good work and wish you good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have always enjoyed good relations with her, especially when I was rapporteur for this year’s budget. I should also like to thank Mr Garriga. I am very pleased that he has adopted for this year a number of initiatives that I took last year. In this connection, I should immediately add another comment about the Commission, because in the letter of amendment for next year’s agricultural budget, two initiatives have been included with regard to the quality of agricultural products and the future funding of infectious animal diseases. I think that we need to investigate at any rate how this will take shape.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back on the past few years, my slogan has always been that we need to be careful with European money. When I consider the level of the European budget of the past few years, that is quite clearly what we have done. We should not break the financial perspectives if that proves unwarranted, but I should add immediately that the Council did make it particularly difficult for us. What is the use of creating new agencies every year if the necessary funding is not available? Moreover, the self-same Council has difficulty reaching a decision as to the location of those agencies. Sometimes they appear in the most bizarre places in Europe and are accommodated elsewhere temporarily. All of that costs money. Removal costs are to be covered and everything is to be funded from the programmes that appeal to Parliament. I do not believe that to be the right attitude, and so I welcome the fact that we are thrashing this issue out properly. It is unacceptable for one branch of the budgetary authority to take unilateral decisions that have financial implications, without indicating how these should be funded in future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Heading 3, there is one component of which I am still strongly in favour, and that is investment support, provided by the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg, to fund small and medium-sized enterprises. I think that we should give as many opportunities as possible to SMEs, to private enterprise, particularly in the new Member States, because some of them still lack a sound and healthy banking sector. That is why it is a good thing that this year again, an amendment has been adopted in the budget at first reading in order to give back-up in areas such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Heading 4, this year’s Budget is again a very tight one. Just as we did last year, I think it is inevitable that we will again have recourse to the flexibility reserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You have left us a little legacy in the form of your speech on the scope and structure of the future Budget. In essence I agree with you, and I am very grateful for the way in which you contradicted your own country’s government’s ideas about a shrinking budget.

<p class="contents">You said – and here I must be cautious – that the agricultural budget is substantial. It is, but we must resist the tendency to use this Budget as a quarry for the new tasks that are to come. What we want is a change of direction, and you talked about the Lisbon targets and economic development. I see rural areas as part of this too. You talk about research, education and innovation; they are needed in rural areas too. Let me remind you that, when the EU was enlarged, a proposal of this House’s Committee on Agriculture was adopted to grant the funds collected for the pro-hectare bonuses as structural aid for rural areas. Nothing has been done about that, and I think we will have a repeat of this argument when, in future, Turkey’s accession is on the agenda. It is important that we invest in our own rural areas, where money gains added value, and the added value should remain in those countries. It might be said that this often makes more sense than investing in certain major industrial projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must – and will – take account of this in the structure of budgets in medium-term financial planning. I hope that the House agrees with me in this. It is unfortunate that our work together is coming to an end. As a result of the redeployment of the mandatory funds, we have rather more responsibility for the agricultural budget. I hope that we can bring about change in line with what Parliament wants. Many thanks for your efforts, Commissioner Schreyer.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that one of the most important tasks and goals for the enlarged European Union of 25 Member States is unquestionably social cohesion on as wide a scale as possible, in order to guarantee living and working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, however, the draft budget for 2005 is not conducive to ensuring a balance between economic and social development. Its aim is rather to achieve a greater degree of balance and solidarity between the Member States and to guarantee equal opportunities on the labour market and in the social sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only does the draft budget fail to reach the possible ceiling of 1.27% of the EU’s gross national product, it will not even reach 1%, as in recent years. In my opinion, however, it is not the budget which poses the most serious problem, but rather the planned cuts to the structural funds set aside for retraining programmes, the cuts to the fight against social exclusion, the cuts to education and to support for NGOs working in the social sector. In contrast, expenditure on the common foreign and security policy will rise.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the European Union must not give priority to the goal of a neoliberal market economy and to strengthening its military potential, but must instead concentrate on goals relating to improving the quality of life. Many of the social problems experienced by citizens of the new Member States are in part due to the fulfilment of economic demands the European Union made of these Member States. It would, therefore, only be fair to reward their efforts and their trust in the European Union. I do not believe that the budget accomplishes this task, and I will therefore have to vote against it. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not believe that we can approve the 2005 budget. We believe that the expenditure is too high, with the commitments amounting to 1.14% of gross domestic income. This budget should form the basis for future financial planning, and we believe that it could have been more restrictive. There are many areas in which savings could have been made. That being said, we of course have nothing against re-prioritising within the framework set up by the Commission and the Council. There are many instances of re-prioritising for which there are good reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally think, however, that it is important for strict limits to be placed upon agricultural subsidies. As Mrs Schreyer said, these constitute 55% of the budget, and that is quite unreasonable. I know that it is not in accordance with the Treaty, but our development proposal involves, of course, reducing agricultural subsidies considerably and instead using the money for new initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We argue in favour of a percentage of gross domestic income as our objective. This is not a block on reform, but a demand for re-prioritisation. Nor do we think that the Lisbon strategy should be the basis for trying to procure significantly increased expenditure by the EU. We believe, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, that growth is a supremely national issue that is not promoted by increased EU expenditure and taxes. That is not the route to increased growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reject the very cornerstone of the thinking behind the budget. I shall not go into all the details of the re-prioritising. All that must be discussed. We need a much clearer link between those who propose expenditure and those who have responsibility for arranging the funding and collecting taxpayers’ money. To me, it seems as if Parliament is pushing for expenditure without accepting the political responsibility for demanding further tax revenue. In the long term, it is not a good division of labour to have one body that proposes expenditure and another whose task it is to obtain the money. That is from where the tensions arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union clearly has to prioritise its budgetary commitments. It recently brought out proposals to increase cooperation within the Union on international terrorism and organised crime. That means an increase in the justice and home affairs budget. The European Union is in a strong position to promote cooperation on asylum and immigration and to promote judicial and police cooperation. That also appears to be the view of the EU justice ministers, who are meeting today to put in place enhanced EU programmes to better coordinate EU asylum policies. The budget in these fields is going to increase next year and in the 2007–2013 financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise my support for the agriculture budget, particularly in view of the fact that we have sold the mid-term review to our farmers and they expect that commitment to be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors' conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration. The budget for next year is going to have to take account of these commitments. Although there have been differences within the European Union as to how best to deal with Iraq, we are all agreed now that the European Union must remain at the forefront of this reconstruction effort. The Iraqi people have suffered too much. We must work together to ensure that their quality of life is dramatically improved, sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that in continuing to waste billions, the EU, which was meant to act as a shield for Europe, is – to put it mildly – committing an extremely serious error. Yet the budget is also full of clever little hidden nooks and crannies, a fact known by few better than by most of those now listening to this debate. I should like to single out just two of these. Firstly, the measures planned in relation to the implementation of the Statute for Political Parties, a great many aspects of which must be described as problematic in terms of democratic politics. This is equivalent to acting by stealth, and, to quote Professor von Arnim, a researcher into political parties, to an undercover source of funding that may be turned on at any time at the taxpayer’s cost. If we continue in this manner there will be adverse consequences for the European project. The same is true of the increase in secretarial allowances for Members of this House, a proposal which is currently only being cleverly held in reserve, but which has nonetheless again been established as a goal. It is of course necessary for us to be able to carry out our work here well, but not in such a way that beneficiaries can make easy money and party officials can receive a great deal of money on repeated occasions without contributing anything to the Parliament, a phenomenon which has been proven to occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, our room for manoeuvre is extremely limited. This is normal towards the end of a Financial Perspective, when new tasks appear for which no provision was made earlier, and funds are eaten up by these tasks. I am not referring to enlargement or cohesion, but primarily to aid for Iraq, new tasks in the field of security and defence policy and the ever-increasing number of agencies. On the other hand, the newly-formed Parliament urgently needs to reassert its priorities and make good on its electoral promises. It must also stand by the position assumed by this House in the past, namely to exert democratic control over the flow of funds within the European Union. On this occasion, Parliament’s traditional strategy, whereby the Commission proposals are reinstated in place of the Council’s traditional and extremely mechanical cuts, has proved inadequate in the face of such a challenge. The votes held in the Committee on Budgets have revealed an offensive strategy endorsed by Mr Garriga, according to which Parliament expresses itself clearly and creates room for manoeuvre before the second round, or the second reading, in order to defend its traditional priorities. These priorities include those mentioned many times in today’s debate, such as the Lisbon Strategy, information policy, development aid for rural areas, which does not necessarily mean the creation of jobs in agriculture, and the fight against terrorism. This time the priorities did not leave much room for new initiatives by the new Member States, something that needs to change in future years. It should be stressed that this strategy gained the strong support of various forces within the Committee on Budgets. The real test of whether inter-party solidarity of this kind can be sustained during the remaining rounds of the 2005 budget battle will, however, come during the vote on Thursday. As an MEP from Gdansk, the birthplace of the Solidarity Movement, I await this vote with hope, and the reason for this is obvious. The strong position the House has adopted this time will have a far-reaching impact on future annual budgets, but above all on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective. With regard to very many words of thanks addressed to Mrs Schreyer again today, there will presently be a further occasion to thank her during our last joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets, which will begin shortly. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many clouds chasing across the skies of Europe now, just as, with enlargement complete and the Constitutional Treaty about to be signed, we should be acting with renewed vigour. There is a persistent miserliness in certain Member States with regard to the European project, which also shows itself in the matter of resources, an essential condition if our objectives are to be supported with adequate means.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barroso Commission looks as though it will be a poor ally in this battle and, in this area as well, Parliament must become the main champion of the institutions’ credibility and win back the confidence of the people. Essentially, we have supported the strategy of our rapporteurs, Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen, in order to restore some coherence to our statements and to honour the principal commitments we made to our electors. The most important of these is the commitment to relaunch the growth and competitiveness strategy. We have done a good job in the Committee on Budgets, one that ought to be supported further.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that a difficult stage in the negotiations is about to begin, and there will be an outcry because we have cut the funding to the agencies, for instance. Who was it, though, that really cut the funding to the agencies? We in Parliament, or the Council, which forces us into making these choices through its penny-pinching miserliness? The same is true for the cohesion policy and external policies: according to the Council, the cost of the reconstruction of Iraq should be borne by the Union’s normal programmes. We have to stand united, ladies and gentlemen. I agree with Mr Lewandowski’s appeal: on Thursday Parliament can vote by a large majority at first reading to ensure a successful outcome for the credibility of our institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, however, presupposes the elimination of the far-reaching differences between the Member States and within regions in the Member States. If the Gothenburg Strategy is to be taken seriously, this involves not merely economic issues, but also the attainment of a balanced relationship between economic development, social development and environmental development, whilst adhering to the principle of equality. After all, the European Union is not merely a project to create an internal market, but also a project based on solidarity! I therefore find it entirely incomprehensible that despite the increased number of tasks incumbent upon the enlarged European Union, a fact referred to in many wise speeches by all kinds of government representatives, funding is now to be limited to 1% of gross domestic product, with the budget at an even lower level. This means that there is no chance at all of us ever putting this idea into practice. I should therefore also like to say to the Council that this kind of behaviour is opportunistic. You make grand proclamations, but when it comes to actually implementing these policies, you backtrack. This is in no way acceptable!</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if we now agree to these proposals, we will already have prejudiced the outcome of the 2007-2013 Budget debate. Once we have chosen to go down this road, it is unlikely that we will ever have an opportunity to say that enough is enough, and that we no longer wish to go along with such a policy. We must therefore respond to this Council proposal with a categorical ‘no’, in order to provide ourselves with the opportunity to achieve a sensible relationship between the Member States with regard to development in various policy areas. Thought must be given to what we want to achieve and which policies we wish to implement before money is made available, rather than the other way round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the agricultural component is concerned, I have to say that 40% is allocated to France, and in my country, 60% of the farmers and market gardeners have to make do without any European contribution. I too fight for French agriculture, but he should get his facts right.</p>
<p class="contents">I am strongly opposed to the Council’s course of action with regard to agricultural spending. The sweeping reform of 2004 – now listen to this, Mr Gollnisch – is putting incomes, especially those of European farmers, under enormous pressure. In some cases, incomes are being halved. That is also why I object strongly to excessive cutbacks in the agricultural budget, particularly in export contributions. I am pleased that the Commission intends to put this right to some extent, and I am also pleased with the rapporteur’s commitment, for he has, in the area of agriculture in any event, shown his good nature and his willingness to revert back to the Commission’s first initiative and to rectify this digression on the part of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may now turn to fisheries, I should like to urge Parliament to act on the Committee on Fisheries’ proposals and establish regional fishery councils. At present, there is a yawning chasm between what is happening in Brussels and what fishermen are experiencing. These regional fishery councils could bridge the gap between what is happening in Brussels and how this should be applied in practice. It follows that Parliament has every reason to cooperate and to try to actually build that bridge. I am also pleased that the rapporteur is in any event prepared, despite his critical stance towards agencies, to equip and furnish the European Maritime Agency. That is of the essence if we want to offer more maritime safety to our coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns animal diseases. I know that there are fresh proposals to carry out more detailed research. As far as I am concerned, the research stage is over and I am pleased with the initiatives by the Dutch Presidency, both at Parliamentary level in November and also via the Council in December, to organise two large conferences in order to achieve better European policy with regard to protection against animal diseases, such as, at the moment, avian flu in Thailand and in Asia. Such an approach packs far more punch than filling the coffers of yet another research fund, because, although we have by now acquired a great deal of knowledge, we still have not summoned the political decisiveness in order to effectively deal with the risks of infectious animal diseases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Speaking for the Socialist Group, we support Mrs Jensen's approach and believe that the amendments represent a satisfactory compromise between the Commission's proposals and the Council's cuts in the draft budget. In particular, I endorse fully the reinstatement of the PDB for the Ombudsman's budget, and also for funding for an objective information campaign on the constitutional treaty. It is important that our citizens are able to make informed decisions based on facts. As regards the secretarial allowance, if we are to improve it, it is essential we have in place an assistant's statute. That is why the funding for this stays in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been following the budget for over five years and the issue I have always focused on is transparency. The budgetary cycle each year is a repetition of the same exercise whereby the Commission proposes X, the Council then cuts it to Y and Parliament comes up with Z. This process is flawed and does not always lead to the most efficient and effective use of resources. I believe the problems arise because we have no opportunity to appreciate the <span class="italic">rationale</span> behind the Council's decisions to increase the budget lines or decrease them. These decisions are taken behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council is serious in wanting Parliament to support its approach, then it needs to make these decisions in the public arena. Over the years, I have tried to improve our budgeting process, especially in relation to the way other institutions come up with and propose their budgets, by encouraging them to take on Activity Based Budgeting, ABB. I have to say that I am deeply disappointed that none of the other institutions have made reasonable efforts to adopt this method. I believe that since the Commission has implemented ABB, its budgeting has improved with greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, there is considerable room for improvement even with the Commission. What is urgently needed there is greater openness and a thorough evaluation of programmes, of successes and failures, to ensure that when programmes are re-targeted or re-evaluated, this is done on the basis of independent evaluation. There are areas where the Commission is still failing to match policy priorities with an adequate level of resources. For example, my particular hobbyhorse is poverty eradication.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just the Commission and the Council that need to demonstrate greater transparency: it would benefit Parliament too. In the last few years, we have seen the emergence of horizontal amendments. Of course they simplify voting procedures, but they also create two problems. Firstly, they blur the decisions taken by COBU and, secondly, the result is that fewer and fewer people are involved in decision-making, both within Parliament and within the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a unique opportunity to address these issues, namely in our deliberations on the next financial perspectives. We have the chance not just to look at the figures and headings, but also to make our internal processes clearer and simpler. The budget process is not just for the anoraks like myself and others who are sitting around here, everyone in this House is accountable to European citizens for the decisions this House makes on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions to take this opportunity to take radical action so that future budgets are simple and transparent. I would also like to add my thanks to Commissioner Schreyer. I would like to thank her for all her work in this area and wish her all the best for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is never an easy matter to represent this House on budgetary matters, whether in relation to the Commission's or Parliament's budget. My congratulations go out to them. Of course, we are not at the end of the budget procedure but already in this big, first public debate we have come a considerable way.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like quickly to cover a matter that we hold dear in my political group – the question of value for money. I should like to underline what Commission Schreyer referred to this afternoon, which is not often mentioned: we have a budget, a very strictly managed budget. In 1992, if I remember correctly, it covered 1.1% GDP and is now under 1% GDP, with savings in the running of the agriculture budget, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to keep particular lines in focus. Mr Titford mentioned the question of funding cultural organisations. We have asked for one of those lines to be in reserve precisely so that we can make sure that the funding goes to organisations that actually exist. But I would remind Mr Titford that even taking the amount of money that he referred to, it is less than 0.01% of the overall budget. Therefore, to refuse to accept the budget on that basis is not really valid. I would have been more convinced if he had taken up the issue of funding for Iraq where, as a political group last year, we asked for EUR 500m to be put in, but everyone threw up their arms and said that we would not be able to find that sum of money. But we have found it because other lines have been able to be pilfered for it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always nice to be right in retrospect, but I would agree with Mrs Dührkop that when funding a budget, we should clearly set the priorities that we wish to set as between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, so that we do not find other objectives submerged within a broader political will. This will be highly necessary when we come to set the next financial perspective: we must not be found wanting in this particular area of external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, linked to the matter of the financial perspective is one of the questions that we put down on the approval of posts. We would like to see whether there are going to be amendments available for the financial regulation to enable us to make sure that monies allocated are properly spent. Therefore, we would like those amendments available to us before we come to final decisions on the financial perspective next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have often pioneered the idea of interinstitutional cooperation. I know that you have done your best, Commissioner, while in office. But I believe that those of us in this House should remember that when we ask the Commission to apply codes of conduct to high-level officials, to the way in which Commissioners run their offices and so on, we should not ask the Commission to apply standards that we ourselves refuse to apply. Therefore, if we ask for a code of conduct we will have to apply it ourselves in the future to retain credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has also been said that the decentralised agencies play an important role for us in negotiations with the Council. Once again, I should like to make it very clear to everyone that we are not opposed to the agencies; indeed quite the opposite is true, as we believe that most of them make an outstanding contribution to our common European concern. Yet we must be aware of the fact that in recent years the rate at which agencies are established has accelerated considerably. Whereas in 1990 there were only three agencies, in 1995 six and in 2000 seven, and there will be 23 as soon as 2005. We have always supported the Commission’s intention to concentrate on its core competencies and transfer certain areas to the agencies, but we want this to occur in a focused manner and under extremely strict political and budgetary control. The Council is always in favour of creating new agencies, and since the Member States have been represented on agencies’ management boards this has been particularly true, above all in the case of agencies which implement European legislation. In the preliminary draft budget for 2005 EUR 281 303 million is earmarked for agencies, EUR 53.7 million more than in the 2004 financial year. We must, however, bear in mind that all but four agencies are funded under Heading 3, internal policies, where very little money remains. We are therefore left with only two options; either we provide the funding earmarked for the agencies without complaint, and cut funding in other priority budget lines in order to find the money to do so; or we negotiate with the Council in order to increase funding under Heading 3 by the missing EUR 54 million. The latter is exactly what we want to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to address Mrs Schreyer once again, and to thank her, as have all the previous speakers. All the men who have spoken before this House know how to pay compliments much better than I am able to, yet, as you are aware, my thanks are sincere, as Mrs Schreyer has persuaded her fellow Commissioners to put forward proposals which are genuinely forward-looking. In fact, they are so forward-looking that I do not believe that it will be possible to implement them during my time as a Member of this House. You are aware of the proposals to which I am referring, which include the general correction mechanism and the own resources report, with the ‘window to the future’ of an income system intended to undergo successive amendments. This was an extremely courageous feat, and one which none of your predecessors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate predecessors. I would like to offer you my heartfelt thanks for this. Mrs Schreyer, women can do it!</p>

It has basically created a mini-budget under the absolute control of the Council, fully integrated into the operational spending of the Council which, on the basis of the gentlemen's agreement, we in Parliament are hardly even allowed to touch. They are taking crucial responsibilities and powers of financial control away from us and holding up the gentlemen's agreement in order to stave off our reaction. For example, the account of the new counter-terrorism coordinator is not audited by the European Parliament, but comes directly under the Council's expenditure. The same applies to the account of the representative for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the FADO programme. Even in its explanatory statement on the budget, the Council itself boasts that its General Secretariat has acquired a new, more dynamic, more flexible profile, a development of which, I repeat, the Council boasts, even adding that it will be demanding new terms for the benefit of the Council. So the Council is building up this separate mini-budget, thereby creating its own separate bureaucracy on foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question therefore should be: do we want a European Parliament which exercises policy on behalf of Europe or a European Parliament which rubber stamps the funding of policies exercised by intergovernmental institutions? Do we want a European Parliament involved in codecision, as provided for in the new Constitution, or a European Parliament which everyone takes for granted and takes no notice of? If this is what we want, we know what we have to do. Absolutely nothing. If we want to be taken notice of and to represent the Union, then we must send the message out in every direction that we are here and that our role is not cosmetic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to the Financial Perspectives, we must ensure that the hand-over takes place smoothly, and we must resist the temptation to debate everything all over again and start from scratch. This would have a damaging effect on the defence of our interests and on European integration. Consequently, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot stress enough how important this point is.

But they will also tell us that what we do, we must do better. Commissioner, if you ask them what sort of things they want us to do, they say 'the things that protect us, the things that help us'. Nowhere is that more true than in the areas of public health: in terms of the safety of medicines; in terms of food safety; and in terms of protection from diseases and health emergencies. That is why I want to follow what Mrs Haug said about these agencies. Some agencies are crucial to our citizens, and we are not providing them with sufficient funding to do the job we expect from them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these I would pick out is the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, where new drugs – orphan drugs, pharmacovigilance, herbal medicines and so on – are piled on top of its initial responsibilities, but the funding is static. I ask the House to support the amendment on orphan drugs that Mrs Haug has tabled on behalf of the Environment Committee, and to look very carefully at funding for the future in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is the European Food Safety Authority, which is expected to move to Parma. It is also being expected to take on new responsibilities, not least in terms of health claims with regard to nutrient profiling and so on. We are not funding that adequately either. That can fall flat on its face, and if does so, then public confidence is lost. That is true of both the bodies I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The third example is that of our new 'baby', the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which is being set up in Stockholm. In Stockholm, it has already been found that costs are higher than anticipated. The value of the Krona has shot up against the euro, and the costs of employment and premises are both having an impact. As a result it will not be possible to implement the expected recruitment policies. I ask that this should be looked into as well, because if we do not protect people from health emergencies and from the dramatic increase in health threats, the public will not thank us. If we wish to pay for this – and we should – then we need to look at the budget for subsidies for tobacco–growing. That would pay for all those agencies. Moreover, if we removed these subsidies, we would also remove a health threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 2005 budget is of particular importance. It is the first Union budget following enlargement, while in 2005 we shall be half way through the Lisbon strategy timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the first reading by the Council was governed by a cutback rationale. The Council displayed inconsistency between the objectives it has set and the resources which it ultimately decided to use in order to achieve them. The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it decides to cut EUR 3 billion from payment appropriations for the structural funds at a time when the European Commission and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly stressed to us that implementation of these programmes is expected to intensify in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises of the political reliability of the Council, when it makes significant cuts to crucial Lisbon strategy policies. The question of political reliability arises when we are currently debating the new financial framework of the Union for 2007-2013 and the impression is created that the symbolic 1% ceiling is concealed behind the Council's cutbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at the first reading on Thursday, the European Parliament must support the restoration of the appropriations for structural policies, in accordance with the strategy which we also followed in the Committee on Budgets, with a sense of responsibility towards the citizens of Europe and towards the objectives which we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it necessary to reinforce policies which aim at sustainable development and employment. We aim to strengthen social Europe and to give serious support to small and medium-sized enterprises. We really need to use the first reading as part of our effort, by December, to make the 2005 budget a reliable development resource which will safeguard the smooth integration of the new Member States, the reduction in differences within the Union and the efficient implementation of European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I too should like to warmly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, for her work and to wish her all the best in her future political career. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
