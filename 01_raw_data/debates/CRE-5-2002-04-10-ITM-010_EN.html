<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ayuso González (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The EU produces 20 million hectolitres of alcohol annually, of which 13 million hectolitres are of agricultural origin and the rest of the Union’s production is what is known as synthetic alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">The main manufacturing industries that use ethyl alcohol are the spirit drinks industry, which represents around 30% of the European alcohol market and can only use alcohol of agricultural origin, and the chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, which represent the other 70% and which can use both agricultural and synthetic alcohol. Both types of alcohol, therefore, are competing in the same market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, there have been five successive attempts by the Commission to set up a COM in alcohol, but all of these attempts have come to grief in the Council. The reasons for this failure lie in the wide variety of national systems traditionally used for alcohol in the various Member States. The main reason is that, in principle, establishing a COM would entail dismantling national aid, as set out in Article 10 of the proposal. This type of aid, linked to rural aid, however, can and should be maintained, not least because it does not distort the market in the current Europe of fifteen.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments in favour of a Community legal framework are to improve the functioning of the single market, to ensure fair conditions of competition between operators and to help improve transparency and knowledge of marketing flows with a view to globalisation. The global liberalisation process is the main threat to European alcohol producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Alcohol imports from third countries are finding it increasingly easy to gain access to the EU market due to new openings arising from preferential systems, GATT tariff-cutting agreements or bilateral negotiations with specific third countries that produce a large amount of alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">Other factors which might affect development prospects for the European alcohol market at this time include the substantial levels of alcohol production in the applicant countries, future tariff reductions in the forthcoming WTO negotiations and a possible increase in bioethanol production for fuel in the European Union, that could significantly alter the horizon for traditional uses of European ethyl alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with such developments, the Council of Agricultural Ministers of 17 July 2000 asked the Commission to examine the possibility of introducing a regulatory framework for agricultural alcohol, in order to improve statistical information and market transparency, as well as introducing a regime for import and export licences, and to create an appropriate management committee for the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing a limited scope or 'lightweight' COM, which does not involve measures under the EAGGF, but does however go further than the Council request in that, in addition to the definitions, statistics, import and export licences system, and the establishment of an appropriate management committee, the proposal also contains elements such as the possibility of establishing tariff quotas and a safeguard clause, the possibility of prohibiting or restricting inward processing arrangements and a specific provision on state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem arises from the fact that a COM can apply only to products included in Annex I of the Treaty, which means it can apply to alcohol of agricultural origin but not to synthetic alcohol. Given that the two types of alcohol compete with each other and are to a large extent interchangeable for most uses, the fact that the Commission is only intending to regulate alcohol of agricultural origin prompts questions about the purpose and value of rules supposedly designed to regulate the European alcohol market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, a problem surfaced at the time of drawing up the corresponding report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was, what should be done with synthetic alcohol? To add synthetic alcohol would mean having to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, given that this addition would involve amendment to the legal basis of the Commission proposal. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market established that the dual legal basis (Articles 37 and 95) is impossible, given that the procedures that correspond to the two articles are incompatible. As a result, faced with the impossibility of amending the proposal to include synthetic alcohol, the rapporteur proposes that the Commission should put forward a new proposal to include synthetic alcohol within its scope. In this way it will be possible to regulate the whole ethyl alcohol market at Community level. You will understand why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted for this proposal unanimously. A COM is probably not the appropriate instrument, but we have to bear in mind that it is the Commission that has the power of legislative initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by asking the Commission three questions. Can you tell what stage negotiations in the Council have reached? Is the Commission intending to withdraw the proposal? If this is the case, does it intend to present another? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are fated to spend at least a few more minutes in conversation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express profound sympathy with Mrs Ayuso González for the amount of work and time she has put into this report, only to discover that it was not possible to construct an adequate legal base to bring in both the sources of ethyl alcohol. As I understand it, ethyl alcohol produced for industrial use comes more or less equally from agricultural sources and from non-agricultural sources, chiefly from the oil industry. In that context, it would be necessary to find a dual legal base to deal with both together.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally I think she is right that it would be absurd for the Community to try to deal with this single identical substance differently according to the two alternative sources. On the other hand, the economics of production and the industrial circumstances of production are quite different, as I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein knows even better than I from his own manifold past experience. So it is quite an important question to try and find a way of dealing with the whole market in a way that is sensitive to both sources of production.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been objectionable – I know from contacts of my own with the oil industry in Scotland – to spatchcock the oil industry-produced ethanol into an agricultural organisation which had been set up without regard to circumstances in the other sector, so we need a two-handed approach to this. Thus it is absolutely right to suggest that the Commission should put its thinking cap on again and come back with a new look at whatever is needed in the way of keeping an eye on the whole alcohol market at this difficult time, dealing even-handedly with both sources of production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol was voted down in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that the Commission should withdraw this proposal and revise it. Whilst the Spanish Presidency would very much like to wrap this issue up during its term of office, I do not think this will be possible, quite simply because Parliament will not have produced a position for the Agriculture Council in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three key issues; firstly, for example, the title of the act. Is a Common Market Organisation appropriate, or a simple regulation? Secondly, to what extent do we include synthetic alcohol? Thirdly, is there the need for a regulation on state aid? As discussions currently stand between Parliament and the Commission, these issues have not been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission were to abandon its dogmatic position on the Common Market Organisation, it could surely agree to the regulation providing for the purely statistical supervision of synthetic alcohol. This way ahead would be possible even without extending the legal basis. I reckon that a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers could adopt the lightweight Regulation that was originally called for. I continue to be highly sceptical about the aid provisions, on which many questions remain unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of universal land use management across the whole of Europe, which includes the sparse areas, and also on the twofold task of agriculture, which is both the cultivation and raising of agricultural products and the care and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, we must support producers of agricultural alcohol through the production of corn, potatoes and fruit.</p>

<p class="contents">The proposal before us now can be traced back to when my country held the presidency in 1999. Then once again it was realised that the alcohol markets need common rules. The objective is to correct the surplus situation and it is being proposed to dismantle national aid as part of the measures to be implemented. The committee, however, was unanimous in its conclusion that the whole proposal should be rejected. Synthetic alcohol should be considered comparable with alcohol of agricultural origin. The legal basis now in force makes this impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group endorses the course of action proposed by the rapporteur as we wish to make two comments: firstly, we want to complain about the unsatisfactory way in which the Commission has prepared this matter, and, secondly, it would be good to keep the legal basis consistent from the point of view of the single market. We could in this way also proceed in the right way in COM reform. Although the Commission’s proposal is by no means totally acceptable, my personal opinion is that it would make the situation better than it is now. We on the committee drafted a good number of amendments to it which might have helped this matter to gain ground. It is a pity that now we will not effect any legislation. This is probably the sixth time this matter has been discussed by the EU institutions. The end result is always the same: nothing is done. The legal basis cannot be changed just like that. We have to continue with things as they are.</p>
<p class="contents">As I understand it, this is all very much based on the question of the codecision procedure relating to agricultural matters, which causes problems all the time. It is continually being discussed in the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development and often we reach a situation that is somewhat artificial.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is in the process of enlarging. Soon we will have ten new Member States, and a simple matter like this, such as similar substances coming from the same source, as Mr MacCormick said here, cannot be dealt with or decided upon. The EU institutions have debated this issue five or six times and have always drawn a blank.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethyl alcohol and synthetic alcohol are, in my view, an excellent example of why we must swiftly address questions about the Treaty, as after 2006, with the reform of agricultural policy, Parliament will have to take some very fundamental decisions. If the Treaty prevents this kind of issue from being corrected and taken forward we really will be on the wrong track. How will it reflect on the agricultural profession as a whole and how will it be for the European agricultural model and its justification if we cannot have a decision on a matter of this sort? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is to establish conditions ensuring that the market is better regulated and that there is greater transparency and fairer competition in trade both within the European Union and with third countries. This product should, furthermore, make a major contribution to the functioning of the single market in this field. Its use in sectors such as the spirits industry and in the chemical, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, gives it a strategic importance in the European context.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, however, only represents around one half of alcohol consumed and produced in the European Union, with the rest being produced synthetically. This type of alcohol which is a good competitive alternative for all uses except alcoholic drinks, has seen increased growth in the European Union. The Commission proposal, however, only covers ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin, and ignores synthetic alcohol, as stated by Mrs Ayuso González.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the proposal will not enable us to achieve even a minimally effective regulation of the market unless we include, without rules or with different rules, this type of alcohol. It is also worth adding that the Commission proposal also fails to solve the problem of the small and very small distillers which, until now, has been resolved by means of national schemes and national aid.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we feel it is reasonable to do as the rapporteur proposes and reject this Commission proposal. The European Parliament would be thereby clearly expressing its dissatisfaction with the scope of the Commission’s intentions and would call on the Commission to submit a new proposal regulating the entire market in alcohol, of both agricultural and non-agricultural origin, and to resolve the outstanding problems with the various national systems in force. The issues of bioethanol and enlargement will also have to be considered in the next proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Members who sit on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, with Mrs Ayuso, have disregarded party boundaries in trying to point the Commission proposal in a more balanced direction. By balanced we mean that, as well as agricultural alcohol, which makes up only a part of the alcohol market as a whole, synthetic alcohol must also eventually be the subject of a Common Market Organisation, both types of alcohol being in direct competition with each other. Our demand that this be done was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there must be exceptions to the existing regulations in Member States which give state support to the production of agricultural alcohol in order to take account of the need to protect the landscape and environment, safeguard the diversity of species and maintain the structures of smallholdings. I am speaking here with specific reference to the German agricultural alcohol monopoly, which has to date effectively performed the functions I have just mentioned. Minimal state aid, which in the European context is in no way relevant to the Internal Market, is used, particularly in southern Germany, to maintain cultural landscapes with fruit meadows that are of ecological value, and which are cultivated and looked after almost exclusively by smallholders. The result of this policy, which has to date been right and proper, can be seen by you yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, on the steepest slopes of the Black Forest, which are now in bloom.</p>
<p class="contents">This small remuneration for caring for the landscape is almost an idea from the second pillar, which is widely believed to be in need of reinforcement. This concern, though, has not been taken into account either. Parliament is therefore, in my view, doing the right thing in rejecting the Commission proposal before us, which, moreover, utterly disregarded the Council's original mandate for a simple framework regulation. We have kicked the ball back.</p>
<p class="contents">I am putting my hopes in the unofficial meeting of agriculture ministers at the end of April, and quite specifically in Mrs Künast. The desirable outcome would be for the Council to take up what Parliament has come up with, which I presume will be decided on tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaß (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I unequivocally welcome the favourable opinion the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has on Mrs Ayuso González' report. Rejection of the Commission proposal for a Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol is the only sensible response that the committee could have delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to briefly recapitulate on why this is the case. The Commission had not been tasked with the setting up of a new market organisation and with using it to intervene in a healthy and intact market. Despite that, and with great zeal, it drew up a proposal whose substantial loopholes are evident even on first sight.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, synthetic alcohol is left completely out of the equation, even though it now has a 50% share of use in the EU and is, above all, indispensable in fields as important as the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. This gives rise to the danger that distortions in competition may result to the detriment of the market for agricultural alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">A new market organisation is also to be rejected in view of the EU's enlargement, and of the fact that very large quantities of agricultural alcohol are produced in many candidate countries. We cannot, shortly before the accession of these countries, make a regulation that takes no account of their circumstances and thus would not sufficiently prepare their existing markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A further significant point of criticism lies in the Commission proposal's manifest complete disregard for the cultural and economic importance of agricultural alcohol. Alcohol, when produced on an agricultural basis, originates as a natural product in small and medium-sized enterprises mainly situated in rural areas, and makes a substantial contribution to preserving traditional cultural landscapes. Mrs Jeggle has pointed this out.</p>
<p class="contents">Its production is also of great significance from an ecological point of view, and the by-products are, indeed, still used as agricultural feedingstuffs. Rural areas characterised by fruit meadows would find themselves in a serious crisis situation if the Commission's plans were implemented. It is easy to see that not only the regions shaped by private business and farming would suffer as a result of this, but that there would also be massive loss of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot and must not overlook this, and so I find it utterly incomprehensible that they are disregarding the adverse consequences for agriculture and above all for small and medium-sized enterprises in this way. The Commission paper before us is thus, in my opinion, a futile approach to shaping the market in alcohol. Any new regulation must cover all types of alcohol. There cannot and must not be partial solutions that bring more imbalances in their train.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from that, it makes sense not to provide a transition period for the current national aid arrangements, but rather to integrate these into the overall framework in a rational way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So this sixth attempt is a real loss.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make use of the opportunity afforded by this short speech to refer to two things. I get the impression that, with the avowed intention of thoroughly justifiably protecting small businesses – some of which are very small indeed – we will end up back with a situation we very often encounter on agricultural issues, where the small players are used as a pretext while the big players can continue to safeguard their position.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not misunderstand me. I am very much in favour of maintaining the small distilleries and the arrangements for benefits in kind, especially in the form in which they exist in Germany, but within bounds, and for the benefit of the small rather than of the great.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with the topic of biofuels, one that is of the utmost importance. I believe that biofuels represent a great opportunity for agriculture. There is still far more that we can do in this area than has been done to date, and that is through research into them, into the conditions to be imposed on them and how best to promote them, so that we can involve these alcohol products, too, in an ecological approach to our surroundings and thereby find new trade outlets for our agricultural sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has spared neither effort nor trouble in trying to bring about a positive outcome in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but that has unfortunately not been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 20 million hectolitres of alcohol are produced in Europe every year, around 13 million hectolitres of which are of agricultural origin. The attempt has often been made to create a common market organisation for alcohol in the EU. Up to now, proposals for this have always failed at Council level, as the national regulatory systems were so heterogeneous, and the frameworks and aid structures so diverse, that no common denominator could be found. This time, the hurdle at which it fell was that of the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission proposal envisages what is termed a ‘lightweight’ COM, with no provision for intervention mechanisms to the detriment of the EAGGF or of export refunds, and, hence, comprises only the definition of products, a system of monitoring foreign trade through import and export licences, the possibility of laying down tariff quotas and a protection clause, the collection of statistical data or specific provisions on state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">My response to this is that I basically welcome the Commission proposal, even though the current position of the alcohol sector in Austria is not a very important problem. I am well aware, though, that for other Member States the inclusion of synthetic alcohol in the proposed COM is a central issue. It is precisely for this reason that I do not see it as possible, because there is no basis that is legally incontestable. It is for that reason, too, that I fully endorse our rapporteur's view that we should call on the Commission to submit a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to make a more critical observation on the relationship between agricultural and synthetic alcohols. The concerns of farmers and of the rural areas as a whole matter to me. It is from this perspective that I would like to point out that the agricultural manufacture of alcohol as the product of specific raw materials such as, for example, wine, fruit, corn, and potatoes represents an important trade outlet. I want to firmly emphasise that this portfolio should cover the production and sale of agricultural alcohol and not of synthetic alcohol. Synthetic alcohol is in my view to be used only for industry, pharmacy, energy and so on, and not mixed with any other products. As a representative of rural areas in Parliament, I will always put forward the interests of farmers and of rural areas, as multifunctional, farm-based, universal and environmentally-responsible agriculture is the model for land management throughout the whole of Europe. It is my view that any new proposal by the Commission should, in any case, provide for a specific Management Committee, as the present Management Committee for Wine is already overstretched by its plethora of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to declare my wholehearted commitment to a common agricultural policy, from which I have learned of the problems of farmers in the different Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso, for her analysis of the proposal and efforts to understand its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this is another proposal to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, after several attempts in the past that all failed for different reasons, as has been mentioned tonight by several Members. The Commission is of the opinion that the actual market situation in this sector made it necessary to propose at least a minimal set of rules and that, under those circumstances, the chances of succeeding this time were fairly good. That was also the opinion of a large majority of Member States that invited the Commission to come forward with such a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore somewhat surprised that, despite the hard work of the rapporteur, who initially came forward with a series of amendments which might well have been considered, Parliament now proposes rejecting the whole proposal. In the draft resolution Parliament has asked the Commission to withdraw its proposal as it does not fulfil its objectives of regulating the whole market of alcohol in the European Union. I presume this amendment refers to the non-inclusion of synthetic alcohol in the proposal for agricultural alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, at this stage, agree with Parliament's position, as is understandable. Parliament's position would imply considering the proposal to be the result of a lack of reflection and lack of analysis of the real situation of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">If, from an economic point of view, there are good reasons to extend the proposal to synthetic alcohol, there are legal and practical reasons why the Commission did not do this, when it established the proposal. Synthetic alcohol is a non-Annex I product and therefore not covered by CAP. Inserting it into the proposal would mean that we would have to find another legal basis other than the CAP Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty. More importantly, the smoothest way to make a proposal was to limit it to agricultural alcohol because the production and trade in synthetic alcohol in the European Union is more limited. Most of the problems the sector faces are linked to agricultural alcohol and not so much to synthetic alcohol. If, once this regulation is applied, serious problems arise in relation to synthetic alcohol, insertion of synthetic alcohol into this instrument could always be envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the fact that the major part of the alcohol market is accessible to both types of alcohol, which therefore compete for the same outlets. In order to realise its objective of better market information and transparency, the insertion of synthetic alcohol in the article on data collection to establish a yearly market balance of the sector and therefore to increase market knowledge might be considered. The Commission is working on that. This would also be defensible without a change of legal base provided that it could be shown that it was genuinely necessary, in order to manage the CMO for agricultural alcohol, that we should have the data for synthetic alcohol. The case-law of the Court of Justice permits the use of Article 37 for provisions that have an ancillary effect on non-Annex I products, where this is necessary for the proper functioning of the CMO. For the rest, the Commission is of the opinion that all other provisions proposed are necessary to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, including the provisions on the application of the rules on state aid. Without a fair application of those rules there would not be a common market for agricultural alcohol, as already exists for synthetic alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say something about the German market in answer to Members who have made reference to that particular aspect. The Commission is well aware of the functioning of the German alcohol monopoly. The purpose of this proposal for a common market organisation for alcohol is not to put an end to the existence of the German monopoly. If the production of alcohol by German farmers, under the rules of the monopoly, including federal payments, is necessary for the maintenance of precious eco-systems or to cover the additional costs of environmentally-friendly production methods, there would be no problems, as current state aid rules offer substantial possibilities for Member States to grant aid for those purposes. If, on the contrary, the aid in Germany is not given for such reasons but is simple operating assistance, paid for other reasons, then the application of the state aid rules would cause a problem. On the other hand, those small distillers who produce not only alcohol but also a spirit, could benefit from the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rules on state aid for non-agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these comments which I have also made on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, have clarified the Commission’s position on the proposal. Moreover, I would like to thank Members of Parliament for their constructive suggestions, which the Commission will consider.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the question put to me by the rapporteur, if this amendment is accepted – which the Commission would regret – then Mr Fischler and my other colleagues will reassess the situation and reflect on a further course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Again I thank all Members that have spoken and others who have dealt with this subject. I thank them for the time they have given to this proposal. In particular I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, for her efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
