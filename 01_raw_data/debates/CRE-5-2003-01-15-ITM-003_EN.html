The first thing that needs to be said is that our staff are doing an excellent job, as you yourself said, Commissioner, and the European Union has a high profile there. However, a year after Bonn, I think coordination is a serious problem, both in the provision and distribution of aid and, more to the point, the policy being applied. By which I mean that the European Union is following one political tack and supporting a strong central administration in Afghanistan, while the United States are taking a different approach and sticking to their favourite tactic of divide and rule from the days of the Taliban and the Mujahedin by backing the warlords, who they seem to think have taken their side. Mr Morillon and Mr Sakellariou said likewise. Unfortunately, the upshot of this divisive western policy is that entire areas are beyond the control of the central administration and this is precisely what caused the recent surge in the production of opium, which accounted for 70% of world production in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Women, of course, are still in a dire situation in all sectors. Blue ghosts continue to waft round the streets of Kabul, with few women daring to risk their lives by taking off their burka. The Taliban may have lost power, but their spirit still haunts Afghanistan. In my opinion, there can be no economic or social progress as long as a culture of violence, religious fanaticism and misogyny reigns in Afghanistan. 98% of women are illiterate and economically dependent and 99% give birth without medical assistance. This sort of soil provides an ideal breeding ground for extremist movements such as the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Greek Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, could do a great deal to help by proposing that a European fund be set up and a line included in the 2004 budget especially for women in Afghanistan. This fund could be used to finance new infrastructures to integrate women into public life. I also suggest, Commissioner, that we should invite President Karzai to Strasbourg to speak before a plenary session of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not forget Afghanistan, which today is beginning to look like a caricature, a caricature of the US imperium. It is clearly a misfortune for any nation to be in a geostrategic or petrostrategic area like the Afghan people are, and this has obviously been the case for a long time. They have endured the British empire, they have endured the Soviet empire; today they are enduring the US empire, but in spite of everything there is a great difference in the nature of things today because, armed as it is with its clear conscience, the US empire can get away with anything, to the point, for example, of calling a wedding party an armed band and destroying a whole village as we saw a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 11 September, the country has in fact been a caricature of a clear conscience. We have not even had the courage – because Europe has clearly abandoned the idea of playing any role other than humanitarian aid – to denounce the fraud of destroying half a country because a criminal takes refuge there. If one day some hothead came from the US and fled to the US after destroying one of the towers in the la Défense district in Paris, it would not occur to me to recommend that my government go and destroy part of the United States of America and then appoint a governor there. I say governor because Mr Karzai is clearly little more than a US governor. I hope that one day Europe will want to play a part, that Europe will stop following the lead of the US, that Europe will at least stop preventing the Member States from playing their own part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too, like other fellow Members, recently went to Afghanistan with a European Parliament delegation and I can bear witness to the truth of the things reported by Commissioner Patten. Let us not forget that we found a country ravaged by 23 years of war and years of drought. The progress made in one year since the first Bonn Conference is truly remarkable, and likewise we should applaud the determination, selflessness and competence of our Commission officials in Kabul. All this is true: schools have been opened, they have started to rebuild some health facilities; valuable work is being done, particularly in terms of supporting the administration. In this connection, I would like to urge Commissioner Patten not to abandon the aspect of specific personnel training, including for customs officers, which is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, however – and the last Bonn Conference showed this to some degree – that the most committed donor countries are asking the Karzai Government to show more determination. There has been some criticism: reforms announced by the Karzai Government itself have been delayed; even though a commission has been appointed to draw up the new Constitution, it is being obstructed by religious issues, by minorities, whereas it needs to go ahead, especially with a specific acknowledgement of women’s rights too; security is still a serious problem; there is no judicial system and there is no national defence force; an operative police force is still lacking. All this is true. The European Union, which has done a great deal, must therefore persevere on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – a final word on women’s rights – I would like to refer here, to the European Parliament, to the appeal which the Minister, Mrs Sarabi, made to us: each donor country has chosen a specific area of intervention; however, no one has chosen the specific issue of women’s rights. This is an urgent appeal that I am making to the European Union and to us all lest we forget this: there is no chance of making progress or finding a way out of this situation unless women are directly involved in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have set out a whole series of useful proposals. I must say that I agree that the role of the administration needs to extend beyond Kabul city limits if there is to be greater stability and normalisation in the country as a whole, that the mission of the ISAF needs to be extended so that it can work along the same political lines and, thirdly, that human rights must be respected, be they women’s rights, prisoners’ rights or adversaries’ rights. We have a history of respect for human rights for institutional, historic and cultural reasons. It is a tradition in Europe and we must respect it wherever necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate as a whole has shown that what we want to create in Afghanistan, as everyone knows, is a country in which the values of democracy and freedom take hold and the potential for economic development and confidence is realised. History has taught us that this is a long, hard process in any country and I know of no other country in which such huge changes have come about in such a short space of time. We, for our part, need to show political determination, we need to provide economic, political and humanitarian assistance, but we also need to be realistic about what we can do, how far we can go, what the prevailing circumstances are, what difficulties the people there face, what balances need to be respected, what values hold sway and how we can provide help in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still a long way from being able to say that the game in Afghanistan has been won. We are only a short way down the line and we still have a great deal to do over a very long period of time. Developments in Afghanistan will be influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external. We need to look at individual concerns, what is happening with the constitution, what is happening on the humanitarian and numerous other fronts, and we need to take an overall view and apply an overall strategy as to how we can influence developments. Success cannot be measured by one criterion alone or by a number of individual criteria which we might mention, and several have been mentioned, be they institutional or individual rights or economic progress. Success will be measured by simultaneous progress on a number of political, institutional, social and economic fronts in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Andrews' contribution covered not only Afghanistan but Iraq. If he had been able to stay until the end of the debate, I would have said that I fear we will have further opportunities to discuss Iraq and he may be able to take part.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Members such as Mrs Fraisse who praised the work done by our officials in Kabul and beyond. They do have a difficult job. It is not the easiest assignment to manage our programme there. I will certainly pass on the commendation of Members. I would also like to express once again my agreement with Mr van Orden that we are in this for the long haul. There are no quick fixes in Afghanistan. We have to go on repeating that. We cannot simply call what we have done so far success and move on to the next failed state. There is a great deal for us to do, not least, as Mrs Fraisse said, in helping to create a public service in Afghanistan which will be able to deliver the sort of services we would want to see to the whole community. The quality of some of the members of the Afghan diaspora who have returned to Afghanistan gives one a good deal of confidence in what could be achieved in that country. I could mention Mr Ghani and many other Afghans who have gone back to their country to help reconstruct it after the years of medieval ferocity to which its people of Afghanistan have been subjected. So I can assure Mrs Fraisse that we shall continue to give proper attention to support and training for public services.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, more than most other donors in Afghanistan, provided budgetary assistance for the ordinary business of government. It is not a very attractive, or sexy thing for donors to do. Donors typically like to have projects and like to have blue plaques on walls and flags over buildings. But unless there is a decent public administration in Afghanistan, unless there are nurses and teachers and doctors and police officers, men and women, and unless those people are paid regularly, there will not be a government that can extend its authority over the whole country. So I continue to defend the priority that we give to that.</p>
<p class="contents">One would have to be deaf not to recognise the concern the House has expressed about women's rights as part of a general concern about human rights. I could go through a list of the projects that we are helping to support, such as the park for women in Kabul, but I will merely say that I think the best way of reflecting Parliament's concern is to raise this issue at the meeting of the Afghanistan Development Forum in March, when we should be monitoring progress. We will emphasise then that this Parliament, which votes this money so intelligently and generously, wants us to ensure that the issue of women's rights is at the heart of the government's approach to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say one other word about donor coordination, because several speakers have referred to that and I only touched on it in general terms in my opening remarks. I fully agree that development aid to Afghanistan must be used to maximum effect and that effective coordination is critical. The Afghan Government has now put in place the structures to coordinate donors. The October implementation group meeting in Kabul agreed to move to a consultative group structure, which is the one that we typically put in place in countries receiving substantial assistance from the international donor community. We strongly support this initiative. It should ensure that donors are well-coordinated and that funds are targeted to the priorities agreed by the consultative group.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also established an informal European donor forum to help develop a coordinated European Union approach to key issues and meetings and there is also an informal donor network between the European Commission and the Member States, the United States and Japan. Through ECHO, the Commission has had extensive experience of operating in Afghanistan over the last ten years and has established close working relationships with non-governmental organisations. As the crisis in Afghanistan unfolded, the key priority was to deliver humanitarian support quickly and effectively, but now looking to the future, it will be important to ensure that all donors operate within the framework and priorities set by the consultative group. So we are aware of these concerns.
