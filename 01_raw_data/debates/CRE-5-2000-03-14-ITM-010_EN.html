<p class="contents">On 4 November 1999 Mr Fischler’s head of office wrote a letter to Mr Pierre Galland, who had taken an interest in the effects of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreements on the Western Sahara self-determination process.</p>

It should be borne in mind that the territory in question is engaged in a process of self-determination and the negotiations on fisheries agreements should therefore not lead to any misunderstanding regarding the EU’s attitude towards the territory’s future, nor should its inhabitants’ rights be infringed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This definition does not in any way affect the status of Western Sahara and its coastal waters.

<p class="contents">The letter which I referred to in my question was very unclear as to the European Commission’s conception of the coastal waters of the Western Sahara. However, you have expressed it with extreme clarity?.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Morocco is currently occupying the Western Sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self-determination.</p>
<p class="contents">However, according to international law, it should be considered that Morocco has control over that territory, although it in no way has sovereignty over it. If it cannot have sovereignty over the territory, neither can it have sovereignty over its coastal waters. This would prejudice the future of those waters, given the possibility that the planned referendum on self-determination will support the independence of that territory. What situation would the Government of the Western Sahara then be in with regard to the waters which it would have the sovereign duty to administrate?</p>
<p class="contents">I agree absolutely that we should reach a fisheries agreement with Morocco which is favourable to the interests of the European Union fishing fleet, in particular the Spanish fishing industry. But I believe this is not contradictory, on the contrary, with a legitimate interpretation of international law which I ask to be done formally.</p>

I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Mr van den Bos on anti-personnel mines today. I will also take this opportunity to respond to Madame Carlotti’s question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioners today adopted a communication and a draft regulation on European Union action against mines with the aim of achieving better coherence, greater effectiveness and more visibility in the very considerable activities in this area in which we are already involved. In doing this, we are responding to and building on the initiative of Parliament to create a specific budget line for mine action. Anti-personnel mines create appalling casualties in many of the poorest parts of the world. But they are not only a constant and treacherous threat to life and limb. They are obstacles to economic development and to the implementation of a range of Community programmes in support of reconstruction, rehabilitation and development. That is why the Union is already involved extensively in mine action across the globe and why we were so active in the negotiation and conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition and destruction of anti-personnel mines which entered into force a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past eight years, European Community support for mine action has exceeded EUR 180 million. We have intervened in all corners of the world. We have supported action by national authorities, international organisations, and not least NGOs. We have contributed to de-mining and mine destruction as well as to victim assistance and research into new de-mining technology. But until now, we have not had a coherent overall approach to our mine action.</p>
<p class="contents">To take full advantage of the diversity of our instruments and funding mechanisms, we must make sure that we have a framework in which we can formulate the necessary horizontal guidelines and priorities in order to ensure effectiveness and consistency in what we do. The funding of mine action from the geographic programmes and their budget lines will continue. Mine clearance and other forms of mine action are often a preliminary step to any sensible development programme. Therefore they should form part of national or regional reconstruction and rehabilitation plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation and the special budget line will support and complement the geographic line by providing the overall policy framework and by functioning as a general reserve and a source for funding for international programmes. The resources available for EU mine actions should remain at least at the same level in real terms as we have achieved over the last few years, that is about EUR 30 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular programmes for mine clearance and destruction under our new policy should principally benefit countries which have subscribed to the Ottawa Convention. But we must also be ready to provide exceptional assistance to mine victims at their homes or when they have been displaced, even when they have the misfortune to find themselves in a non-signatory country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union is recognised as one of the leading contributors to mine action within the international community. The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention a year ago provided us with a forceful new instrument and a set of ambitious targets for the years to come.

As to the disaster that occurred in the Rivers Tisza and Danube, my colleague Mrs Wallström, has announced, as a result of the leakage of cyanide into the Danube, that as of now, the Commission’s inquiry into the potential environmental risks posed by the mining industry, which is already under way, is to include an investigation into the situation in all the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Community environmental legislation currently in force is to be examined in detail in order to ascertain if it would be desirable to extend it to environmental risks occasioned by the mining industry. As far as the problems of a more general nature are concerned, i.e. those raised in the second part of the question, the Commission is well versed in the report put forward by the European Environmental Agency. This report formed the basis for the overall assessment of the fifth environmental action programme. This assessment has shown that Community policy has enabled us to chalk up positive results in a number of areas recently, for example in the work that is being done to contain acidification, improve water quality and protect the ozone layer.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, however, the current state of play and the prognosis for the future give great cause for concern. This is largely due to the fact that rapid growth in a number of economic sectors is ruining our endeavours to reduce the impact on the environment. The Commission intends to apply itself to the most serious of these problems in its draft for the sixth environmental action programme. It will base this on the idea that has already been expressed in the overall assessment, i.e. that in principle we should retain the general plan underlying the fifth framework programme, but it must be substantially reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need most of all is for the Member States to devote more energy to implementing Community legislation, and for environmental interests to be integrated into other policy areas more effectively, so as to ensure that economic growth and environmental damage are no longer two sides of the same coin. The Commission awaits the European Parliament’s opinion on its overall assessment and will put forward its proposals for the sixth environmental action programme – to be drawn up on the basis of the positions adopted – by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the constructive step represented by the signing of the memorandum between the Commission and Bulgaria on nuclear safety at the Kozloduy plant and the opening of accession negotiations with Bulgaria, there is legitimate concern over the agreed procedure for decommissioning the four unsafe reactors at Kozloduy, as the procedure is not in line with the Union's position or Bulgaria's commitments in the agreement it has signed with the Nuclear Safety Account.</p>
<p class="contents">What decisions have been taken regarding the definitive closure of units 1 and 2 by the end of 2002 and what steps have been taken to conclude an agreement on the definitive closure of units 3 and 4 earlier than 2006, as called for in the agreed memorandum?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission use the opportunities and means available to it in the context of its partnership with Bulgaria to bring about the definitive closure of units 1 to 4 at Kozloduy, and in what way?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the setting of a date for the decommissioning of reactors 3 and 4 – as referred to in a letter of 17 February from the President of the Commission, Professor Prodi, to the author of this question – a condition of granting financial aid to Bulgaria?</p>
<p class="contents">What was the outcome of the meeting held on 4 February between the Commission and the Bulgarian authorities and what is the joint working party working towards?</p>

This policy proposes shutting down those reactors in the case of which, upgrading to internationally recognised safety standards would not be financially tenable.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The agreement concluded between the Bulgarian Government and the Commission provides for units 1 and 2 of the nuclear power station at Kozloduy to be conclusively shut down before 2003. In addition, provision is made for the government of Bulgaria to reach agreement with the Commission in the year 2002 on deadlines for shutting down units 3 and 4 of the same power station. All four units will be shut down earlier than the dates that the Bulgarian Government originally had in mind, which were 2004 and 2005 for Kozloduy 1 and 2, and between 2008 and 2010 for units 3 and 4.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working on the assumption that the final shut down of the two reactors 3 and 4 will take place in 2006 at the latest. The Commission is offering to provide Bulgaria with several years of extensive aid, so as to help the country overcome any problems arising from the shutdown. This includes grants from the PHARE programme to the value of EUR 200 million and a EURATOM loan.</p>
<p class="contents">The various components of the aforementioned agreement form an integrated whole. In order to ensure full implementation of the agreement, we will not confirm our undertaking to provide the second tranche of the grants until we have reached conclusive agreement on shutdown dates for units 3 and 4. Both components of the aid package – the EURATOM loan as well as the grant – will depend on how and whether Bulgaria fulfils its obligation to shut down the blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 February 2000, the joint working group on Kozloduy comprising representatives from the Commission and from Bulgaria, met in Sofia. This joint working group agreed to draft a work schedule for the shutdown of units 1 and 2, by May or June 2000, and to put forward a political framework and potential projects in the energy sector that are to be financed by the aid package.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to point out that Bulgaria did not take the decision to shut down operations lightly. The decision shows, however, that the Bulgarian Government, as required under the terms of the enlargement process, subscribes to the European Union’s commitments to achieve higher safety standards in the nuclear sector. The Commission will continue to work together with the Bulgarian Government to implement the agreement of last November. This cooperation will also take place under the auspices of the accession partnership, which has made this task one of its priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I also have a number of queries because, during your hearing before Parliament’s Committee on the Environment and here today, you talked of decommissioning nuclear reactors which, as we all know, are extremely dangerous, as quickly as possible. And not just these reactors, but also the reactors in Slovakia and Lithuania. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I appreciate that there are certain difficulties involved in closing them down immediately, but is that the earliest possible date? I just wonder because, although you set a specific date for units 1 and 2, saying that they would be closed down before the end of 2002 – which in my view is quite a long way off because, as you know, we are afraid of an accident in any one of the four reactors, which would be disastrous both for Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, as well as for neighbouring Greece and Europe too, since, as you know, these installations are very dangerous – what is stopping you from setting a date for the closure of reactors 3 and 4? And why are you keeping them open until 2006, or even longer as you will no doubt turn round and tell us in the future?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was very surprised to learn that I was openly criticised by some Member States following the conclusion of the agreement in Bulgaria, because this agreement was said to be too hard on Bulgaria and to go far too far, and because safety standards at these power stations were said not to be as bad as the Commission was claiming. Now it is up to me who I believe. I believe the reports that were compiled at the outset, and I still maintain that we must abide by the principle of risk avoidance in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I must ask you to bear in mind that the decision on whether to go for the nuclear option in energy production is the sovereign right of each and every State. The Commission is no more able than Parliament or the Council to forbid any country in the world from using nuclear energy, or to force them to shut down reactors without delay. All we can do is put a package together, as we have done in Lithuania and Slovakia, and, just recently in Bulgaria too, that enables the country in question to deal with the economic and financial consequences of shutdown operations of this kind, and their impact on society and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be left to the country concerned to determine how to implement the objectives set as quickly as possible. All I can say is that this is what proved to be attainable during negotiations, which I headed myself part of the time. If we had tried to achieve more, then we would have failed to reach agreement and ended up with no shutdown dates whatsoever. You can always do one of two things in such cases: either accept the attainable or maintain a very intransigent attitude, which may, at the end of the day, salve your conscience on the environmental policy front, but will leave you empty-handed. As a matter of fact, I believe we achieved a particularly positive outcome in Bulgaria, in view of the extremely difficult situation there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point something else out to you, somewhat circuitously, but you will soon see why. As far as the shutdown dates for blocks 3and 4 are concerned, it says in the text that this will be decided on in 2002. So that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind. As the Commission understands it, this shutdown will take place by latest – and I repeat, latest – 2006, which is also stated in the text. The fact that the Bulgarian government signed this text without questioning this, has a certain political significance. That is all I can say on the matter, but I think you know what I am driving at. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative was drawn up immediately after the Singapore Conference, when the Council invited the Commission to make proposals in favour of the least developed countries, both for immediate action and additional medium-term action. In its conclusions dating from June 1997, the Council made reference to the expression: ‘essentially all the products of LLDCs’.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the immediate measures, in the GSP regulation at the end of 1998, the Community established, for all least developed countries, a system equivalent to that of the Lomé Convention, as the Council had requested. In 1999, as part of the post-Lomé negotiations, the Council, among other things, specified what it intended to do regarding market access for LLDCs and decided that the Community should, in the year 2000, commence a process which, by the end of the multilateral trade negotiations and by the year 2005 at the latest, will enable free access for essentially all LLDC products, based on the trade system existing under the Lomé Convention. The difference between all and essentially all products affects, as we well know, a number of specific agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the mandate which the Commission was given and therefore, naturally, we must respect it. My own services are currently preparing proposals which will be presented to the Council when they are completely ready.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Community, in its ‘least developed countries’ initiative within the framework of the WTO, seeks to associate other commercial partners to this market opening policy of ours, which would consist of exempting essentially all the products of LLDCs from duties and quotas. This initiative is intended, if I may say so, to kick-start our own proposal which, combined with what we can achieve with other parties, would enable the least developed countries to sell their products, in virtually total freedom, on a large number of markets other than our own. I am thinking particularly of the markets of the developed countries: the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. I am also thinking, possibly, of a number of emerging countries, already industrialised. At the moment I am making great efforts to move forward this initiative which we have included in the rescue package which we are working on in Geneva. That is the state of play at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">As the questioner indicates, we should ask whether the restriction associated with the expression ‘essentially all products’ may be retained for very much longer as soon as we consider granting these countries total access to our markets. As far as the Community is concerned, following the signature of a new agreement with the ACP countries which no longer includes the obligation to offer equal access for all ACP countries, we could in fact start thinking about more extensive liberalisation of access to our markets in favour of the least developed countries. I should not, however, wish to start thinking about this until our present initiative regarding essentially all products has reached a sufficiently advanced and credible stage, following talks with our commercial partners, to be able to move on to the next stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I should specify, finally, that access to the market is not the only requirement for countries that, occasionally, do not have a sufficient export capacity for internal reasons, be they distribution, logistical or transportation capacities. It is therefore necessary to look at what is termed ‘capacity building’, i.e. technical assistance measures to be implemented in order to ensure that this access is tangible and not just theoretical. This is the response I wished to give to this question which looks to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly agree with what he said in the last part of his answer about the need for capacity-building in the least developed countries as well as, perhaps the need for asymmetrical measures, resulting in a certain level of protection for their markets that we do not seek to enjoy in return. But my main concern in asking the question – and I do not feel this has been fully dealt with – is over this matter of exactly what "essential products" means. Commissioner Lamy talks about certain agricultural products, but it has been precisely the protectionism of the common agricultural policy that has most offended developing countries and which has held back development for many of those countries in terms of agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned, and for how long? That is the sort of message we want to hear. I wonder whether it would not be a better step forward, in terms both of winning the confidence of the developing countries and of acting as an example to other trading partners, for us, as Europe, to say: "now is the time; we are going to offer this now. We do not want to wait for five years; let others follow our example".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I think I gave a clear answer to your question when I said that the difference between ‘all’ and ‘essentially all’ affected only a really very limited number of agricultural products. I am thinking particularly of sugar which can effectively constitute an additional resource for several of these countries. You know that the Community, and in this case the Commission, has considered the idea of a complete review of conditions in the sugar industry. These are matters to which we shall no doubt return. But that is something that only we need concern ourselves with.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the more comprehensive initiative that we have undertaken, I would like to try to convince you that at this stage it is more important, as far as these least developed countries are concerned, that the Community should persuade the United States, Japan and a number of developed countries to follow our initiative because, in terms of real export capacity, this initiative opens up a market to them which is, roughly, twice or three times larger than our own. In terms of our priorities, then, Mr Howitt, and in terms of efficiency, I feel that, given the choice of either eliminating the difference between ‘essentially all’ and ‘all’, a problem which I acknowledge must be solved one day, and considerably increasing the size of the market opened for ‘essentially all’ products, duty free and quota free, we are on the right track if we work, in the first place, on expanding the market. Thereafter we will be able to start to think, as you wish, on the approach we might adopt with the Member States, who sometimes show some reluctance, and a European Parliament which will also have to be convinced, when the time comes, that we should go on to the second stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, moreover, exactly the type of agreement which would be submitted to Parliament’s assent if the Commission’s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference were accepted by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains, however, that at this stage they are no more than proposals and the Commission cannot contravene the regulations in force under the Treaty establishing the Communities, nor can it anticipate the decisions which the Member States will take at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind Mr Clegg, if necessary, that, in consideration of its service-related aspects, the agreement on China’s accession would in any case be subject, in principle, to the consultation procedure envisaged under Article 300. This would mean that Parliament should have the opportunity, pursuant to Article 300, to declare its opinion on this agreement. Obviously, in the normal course of things, it is up to the Council to consult the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the legal and institutional answer to your question, Mr Clegg. With regard to more practical aspects, let me restate my determination to try to find some way, together with the European Parliament, to have Parliament play an active part in these negotiations. I have said this on several occasions, and I feel it is important in terms of relations between the Commission and Parliament and also in terms of the effectiveness and capacity of the negotiator in this type of case. I am therefore perfectly willing, as always, to discuss this matter in somewhat greater depth with the relevant parliamentary committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me reiterate my appreciation that the Commission and Parliament are, for the first time, speaking with one voice on changes to Parliament's role in important trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to ask you a non-legal and institutional question: if we look, for instance, at the decision which was taken to submit the Uruguay Round conclusions to the assent of this Parliament, there were some legal questions relating to the institutional and budgetary implications of the Agreement, but the decision was fundamentally a political recognition that this was an agreement of such importance that the strict boundaries of what was then Article 113 could, so to speak, be overstepped, thus allowing the Agreement to be submitted to Parliament's assent. My own view is that the accession of China to the WTO, whilst perhaps not quite as eye-catching as a multilateral agreement, is just as important to the future global trade regime, and that a similarly political position might therefore be taken by both Parliament and the Commission. I would urge you to do so. I would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that, I feel that the comparison you make with the Uruguay Round is not totally justified. At the time of the Uruguay Round, particularly when the mechanism for the settlement of disputes was being set in place, there was a institutional shift in the international legal order which justified assent, specifically with regard to an unequivocal reading of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards China, legally speaking this is the procedure for the accession of a country to the WTO, and it is proceeding according to a relatively appropriate and familiar route, one which, for the time being, has not given rise to any disputes. I suppose, then, that the Council will be reluctant to require assent because the Council is not in the habit of going much further than is required by the Treaties in terms of consultation with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing, from our mutual point of view, is that, when the time comes, we can, either in committee or in plenary session, have a debate on the conditions which, I hope, will be those we have agreed with the People’s Republic of China, and that this will be completely transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am perfectly willing to take part in this. I know, when the time comes, that questions of a rather more political nature will be asked. That is perfectly normal, I feel, and I look forward to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My question, however, concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement. When talks between the EU and China commenced, we MEPs were told that there would really not be any great problems, as approximately 80% of the EU objectives were contained in the outcome of the negotiations between the United States and China. Now, however, it would seem that the rest, the remaining 20%, are so problematic, that time is passing by and the talks have already ended in deadlock on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask whether it is a question of the Chinese not being prepared to accord us the same negotiating status as they did the US representatives or why we should not be able to achieve consensus on the remaining – the tail end – 20%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember using this expression, contrasting 80% and 20%. It was intended to offer an explanation of the fact that a good deal of the work has already been done because, thanks to the most favoured nation clause, we inherit everything that the previous negotiator has achieved. That still leaves 20%, however, and for a very simple reason. In bilateral negotiations, each party tries to focus on the areas where he is least competitive, since it is understood that the rest will be left to the others.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in a number of subject areas, the United States have signed a bilateral agreement with the Chinese which is of benefit to us but which, on several points, is not as favourable as if we had negotiated it ourselves. That is the first reason. What we have to do as far as possible, and I am making every effort to achieve this, is to ensure that what is generally a good deal between the Americans and the Chinese is also a good deal for Europeans. So we are left with this remaining 20%, and it is only 20%, but, as you know, in negotiations the last few percentage points make all the difference, and this is where we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another, more technical reason, involving some subtle points. Although the designations are fairly similar, there may be very different tariff items. Let me take the example of spirits. Bourbon and gin are not handled in the same way as whisky and cognac. Even though all spirits are ostensibly the same, there are cases where tariff items are not the same. These are more technical considerations, but they show that all these aspects must be looked into and negotiated in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not quite over yet. I mentioned that I would be going to Beijing during the last week in March in order to attempt to resolve what I feel are real difficulties in these negotiations. These concern the political section with regard to which the Chinese authorities have expressed a number of reservations. My mandate at present is to attempt to overcome these reservations, and I shall make every effort to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, a financial perspective was adopted in Berlin, i.e. we decided how much money we could spend.

<p class="contents">The Fisheries Council of October 1997 analysed the imbalance between fisheries agreements in the North and South, given that shipowners fishing under agreements with countries of the South are increasingly required to co-finance the agreements, which are free of charge for shipowners in the case of the North. It also analysed the fact that agreements with northern countries are under-utilised, despite the interest shown by other Member States in making use of these fishing opportunities. The Council therefore asked the Commission to consider decisions allowing quotas to be transferred from one Member State to another and to examine by what means the financial costs of agreements should be 'equitably shared, on a non-discriminatory basis,' between the Community and shipowners.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say what studies it has carried out on the possibility of transferring quotas and what the outcome was? What decisions have been taken to balance the financial cost of agreements with the North and South?

The Commission would like to point out that the problem of under-utilisation has only arisen in the case of the agreement with Greenland, which is the only agreement to have been concluded in the northern region. </p>
<p class="contents">However, Mrs Fraga Estévez is surely aware that quite a number of Member States regard any transfer of quotas whatsoever as an attack on the principle of relative stability.

Consequently, the Commission takes the view that this tricky issue can only be dealt with as part of a wider and overall examination of the common fisheries policy as a whole. You will be aware that this examination is to take place during the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>

<p class="contents">When you talk in terms of an imbalance between the agreements with third countries in the northern hemisphere and those in the southern hemisphere, I feel I must make you aware of the following situation: the Community and the Member States do not pay a licence fee in the case of agreements with third countries in the north because said countries do not ask for one, rather these agreements – with the exception of the agreement with Greenland – are reciprocal, in other words, a fish for a fish, and have no effect whatsoever on the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Third countries in the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, require the Community and shipowners to pay fees. Incidentally, licence fees of this kind were a feature of the bilateral agreements between Spain and third countries even before Spain joined the Community. And so you will appreciate that we are not about to volunteer to include licence fees in the agreements with Greenland and other northern States, when our treaty partners do not require us to do so. Apart from that, other third countries fish in the waters of these northern States and they do not pay licence fees either. Naturally we would want to avoid our fishermen being treated differently to those from third countries who fish in the same waters, but this is exactly what would happen if we were to volunteer to pay licence fees.</p>
<p class="contents">Another difference between the agreements with countries in the north and those with countries in the south is that the Community’s fishing opportunities under the northern agreements are expressed in terms of total catch size. It works in a different way with the southern agreements. Under these, our opportunities are expressed directly in terms of the number of fishing vessels or even licences. Of course this presents an opportunity to include licences for shipowners in the agreements. And so you will appreciate that there are good reasons as to why we proceed differently with agreements with countries in the north to how we do with agreements with countries in the south. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly a problem, for although the Commission shares your view in principle, Mrs Fraga Estévez, that under-utilised quotas should be transferable, we still lack the necessary arrangements for doing so, because the Member States will not give their consent. You mentioned the Council. That is why we must overcome this problem. But I do not believe that we can solve the problem by paying fees for fishing quotas under a new agreement with Greenland. That is no way to solve the problem. We must draw a distinction. “Yes” to sharing out non-utilised quotas and a mechanism for doing so, but we should not start introducing licence fees where we do not have to pay for the quotas. There is little point in doing that in our view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the devastation caused by the storm which struck western Europe in December 1999, the forestry sector is in a particularly serious plight. </p>
<p class="contents">In response to the urgent need for stocks of fallen timber to be disposed of, the French Government has, amongst other measures, decided to grant 50 French francs per tonne in order to subsidise the transportation of timber intended for export to other EU Member States. </p>

<p class="contents">Is the export aid which has been made available by the French Government compatible with Article 92? If so, could such aid be extended to cover timber exports to third countries?</p>

We can only apply existing Community law in such cases. Provision is made, under Article 87 of this Community law, for damage – and I repeat, damage – which is the direct consequence of a disaster, to be made good. In other words, firstly there has to be evidence of damage, and secondly, a direct link has to be established. You must also consider the following: if we were to entertain such an idea – after all, the price of wood is not just down in the French forestry industry, for the disaster has brought it down throughout the Community – then every other Member State would be within their rights to come and ask us to approve export aid.

In fact this proposal met with the approval of a majority of the management committee. That being the case, it will be possible to fulfil all the contracts concluded in the Member States. The only exception in this respect is Spain, where, in view of the high number of applications, the take-up rate, if I can put it this way, was 98% rather than 100%. This meant that Germany’s original allocation of 148 000 hectolitres could be increased to 468 000 hectolitres. That is what the contracts concluded in Germany amounted to in total. The amended regulation on preventive distillation will be published in the Official Journal in the near future and will be made retrospective to 24 February. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the works on the road route are already under way. We are right, therefore, to ask questions about the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am afraid that provision will be made for a little tourist train just to, perhaps, keep the ecologists happy, and that will be all. </p>
<p class="contents">Studies have been carried out, however, such as the Gretab study, to cite but one, which show that in fact the railroad route via the Somport–Pau–Canfranc–Jaca pass would enable a volume of heavy goods traffic equal to that currently using the Mont Blanc Tunnel. What we would in fact like to see, therefore, and what I would have liked to know, following Mr Lamoureux’s proposals within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the effect that the European Union was really going to prioritise rail, is what do you actually propose to do in real terms in order to ensure that Member States also make this a priority? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, as you well know, we clearly have problems with one of the countries involved with regard to the railway between Oloron and Canfranc.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that crossing the great mountain ranges of the European Union is a problem. For this reason, in 1999, the Commission subsidised a study observing the flow of through land goods and interchanges in sensitive areas, namely the Pyrenees and the Alps, because they have similar problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we intend to produce a communication on this subject – on the Pyrenees and the Alps – before the end of the year, proposing concrete solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of this study that we are carrying out will also be taken into account in the revision of the guidelines on the Trans-European Networks and, furthermore, the INTERREG II programme has also financed general studies on the suitability and viability of a future central crossing in the Pyrenees, adapted to heavy goods transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all this, and as I have made very clear in some of my appearances, I believe that we must make an enormous effort to develop goods transport by rail.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a level of demand which is clearly not going to be resolved by means of an increase in roads and we need to study a better use of the rail infrastructures, which is an alternative which is not only much more appropriate from an environmental point of view, but furthermore, they are an alternative which allow us to use some existing infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, such as the specific case we are talking about, we must put the infrastructures in order, but of course we are prepared to speak to the Member States – and we are doing so – to see if we can persuade the two countries involved to finally accept a project of this type which will allow for a central crossing in the Pyrenees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The project for a new Verona-Munich through railway line has been under discussion for years. Traffic on the Verona-Munich route is increasing, yet only one third of the capacity of the existing railway line is being used. The way to reduce the air and noise pollution caused by long-distance lorries would be to switch all heavy through traffic from road to rail. To achieve this, motorway tolls for goods vehicles must be increased and a fast and efficient railway line must be provided. If a new line is built, care must be taken to select the option that has the least damaging impact on the environment. As the infrastructure is supposed to last for hundreds of years, it is essential to find the best solution. It appears that the Commission favours the Brenner base tunnel project.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission not intend to reconsider the alternative ATT3 project put forward by the engineers Trojer and Kauer?

<p class="contents">In principle, it largely follows the route of the current conventional line. The proposal of the ATT 3 project, which is well known to the Commission, deviates from the route established in the guidelines of the Trans-European Network.</p>

<p class="contents">As well as the ATT 3 proposal, which is of interest to the honourable Member, the Commission has received another series of alternative proposals and considers, based on technical, economic and environmental evaluations by the Member States involved, that the so-called base tunnel, work on which is under way, offers a series of advantages when compared to other alternative routes.</p>

<p class="contents">Of course, all of this is linked to our society and its development.

<p class="contents">I would point out that the alternative project ATT3 – and I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock and the chairman, Mr Coleman, for their efforts here – has been examined closely and in great detail by the Commission over the past two years, and I have also received a written report on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add that the question from Mr Messner goes like this: “in the event that a new installation is to be built, the project that is the most and least environmentally friendly is to be examined”. It is completely beyond me as to why anyone should ask the Commission to make sure that something is as harmful to the environment as it possibly could be. This is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected. The fact that this request came from the Greens makes it all the more baffling, and it should be thrown out for this reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
