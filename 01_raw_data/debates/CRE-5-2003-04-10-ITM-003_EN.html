<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission is well aware of the difficulties posed by the fall in world coffee prices for the many farmers in the developing world who rely on coffee for their livelihoods. They have received proposals from Member States and NGOs for action to deal with this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently supporting initiatives in the context of the International Coffee Organisation, the platform for dialogue between the coffee-exporting and -importing countries, in both the public and the private sectors. We are supporting the ICO coffee resolution 407 and requested the European Coffee Federation to conduct independent monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also taken up the issue of ICO membership with the United States. As proposed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 November 2002, we have requested the ICO to undertake a worldwide comparative analysis of coffee growing areas. In the ICO, this initiative is greatly supported by the coffee producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the problem is not just coffee. It concerns many other commodities and commodity-dependent countries. We should therefore not look at coffee as a stand-alone issue. We are in favour of a long-term and coherent strategy to address the problems of commodity-dependent countries, building on extensive ongoing efforts. Falling and volatile prices are indeed a major threat to the sustainable development of some of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-term solution is twofold: since traditional commodities remain the major source of employment, income and foreign exchange for many developing countries, efforts must include making the traditional commodity sectors more competitive. On the other hand, alternative non-traditional product chains must also be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Two recent communications from the Commission, on rural development and on trade and development, provide a clear policy framework to address the problem of commodity dependence. In view of this we are not yet convinced that there is a need for a separate communication on the issue, as some have been suggesting. We are currently finalising an analytical working document on the major challenges relating to commodities. Several of the issues in the European Parliament resolution are being analysed. Following discussions on this analytical working document, we will judge the need for a separate communication.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been calls for action on trade policy. However, there is limited room for manoeuvre. Most coffee-dependent countries are least developed countries or part of the ACP group. With the Everything But Arms initiative, the Community has opened up all markets to the least developed countries, and we will seek to get other countries – developed and developing – to follow our example. ACP countries also have very high levels of access to the EU market under existing agreements, and access will increase under the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, market access alone is not enough. To improve the competitiveness of the coffee sector and broaden the export base in developing countries, we also need to support the full integration of commodity issues into the long-term development strategies of the developing countries. As mentioned in the EP resolution, efforts should include support to producer efforts in diversification, organisational strengthening and tapping into niche markets. Future economic partnership agreements with the ACP, as well as comprehensive and coherent development assistance, would be very helpful in supporting the implementation of the strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct intervention in commodity markets through price support or stock destruction does not offer a sustainable solution. Furthermore, the Cotonou Agreement includes a facility which can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of fluctuations of ACP countries' export earnings – the FLEX system. Countries whose export earnings are being hit by falling prices of coffee or other commodities can apply for compensatory financing under this measure, and some have already done so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains open to proposals for action from all actors. We will attend the forthcoming ICO/World Bank round table and the subsequent ICO/Council meeting in London, and look forward to a positive and constructive discussion that will improve the situation of coffee farmers and labourers in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen for his introductory speech. Just as he says, the price of coffee has fallen dramatically in recent years. We now have the lowest real price in decades, and it does not seem especially likely that prices will increase in the foreseeable future. The price of the raw material itself is at present approximately just one per cent of the price on the market. An ordinary coffee planter in Tanzania or Kenya earns at best a few euros per week. That means that he or she – it is often women, by the way, who work on the coffee plantations – would have to labour for a week or more in order to afford a single cup of coffee in a bar here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the end of the Cold War, prices were reassuringly maintained. You could survive on planting coffee. Developments in recent years have, however, been devastating. Competition has become tougher. Just one of many reasons for this is that the World Bank has helped new countries outside Africa to organise large-scale coffee planting. As so often, subsidies – however important they may appear in individual cases – have dealt a blow to prices and, in that way, damaged the prospects of survival for millions of small coffee planters, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The collapse in coffee prices has led to a major crisis for tens of millions of coffee planters in dozens of developing countries, where coffee is not only an important source of jobs and income in the countryside, but also of currency income.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem in this connection – also addressed by Mr Liikanen – is that cultivation is too often unbalanced, and this naturally exacerbates the consequences of the crisis. As long as small coffee planters are dependent upon just a single crop, their economic situation is, and will remain, incredibly precarious. It would therefore seem incredibly important to diversify production, and there are opportunities for doing this that have not been made use of. This presupposes, however, the adoption of a comprehensive approach to the system of cultivation. I shall not attempt a more detailed scientific analysis, but allow me to give an example. The coffee bush cannot at present be used for animal feed. It contains caffeine, which animals cannot tolerate. What is interesting, however, is that it is possible to cultivate excellent, nutritious mushrooms from the remnants of the coffee bush. These mushrooms, for example shitaki mushrooms, are of high nutritional value and produce a much higher price per kilo on the market than coffee does. Once the mushrooms have done their job and soaked up the caffeine, the remnants may be used as animal feed. Suddenly, the indigent coffee planter has several different sources of income and more work opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Worthwhile projects are under way at present, for example in Colombia, to promote a broader view of the cultivation system. As everyone without exception will surely appreciate, this presupposes, however, knowledge derived from a variety of research disciplines and not a one-sided focus upon a single crop.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with Commissioner Liikanen, I too do not believe there are quick and simple solutions. The issue must nonetheless be addressed, and this must happen immediately within the framework of the whole Doha process and, above all, within the framework of our continued cooperation with those countries within our immediate purview.</p>
<p class="contents">As our resolution intimates, a long list of measures may be taken in the short term, especially to help those coffee planters who have ended up in this very problematic situation. It should be possible to make use of the major surpluses within the European Development Fund to step up our efforts in the field of rural development – rural development that would then become more diversified in form than it would by focusing solely upon individual crops. Through dialogue with the big coffee producers and retailers, it should also be possible to ensure that better wagers are paid to the indigent coffee planters.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only had time to touch upon just a few aspects of this issue. I would thank Mr Liikanen for his contribution, and I look forward to continued dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Glenys (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, last week in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly we unanimously adopted a resolution on coffee. We called for urgent measures to alleviate the impact of commodity price instability in ACP countries. We have joined a chorus of voices from the Spanish parliament, the US Senate and the House of Representatives that are demanding change.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-seven ACP countries are dependent on coffee. It is that background knowledge, which the Commissioner outlined, that explains why it is so serious that world coffee prices have crashed by more than 60% in the last decade. Today, Parliament, in its resolution, calls for action. The international community, including the EU, has a responsibility now to address the collapse of world coffee prices and to alleviate that terrible suffering which Mr Wijkman talked about – 25 million coffee-dependent poor farmers and the communities in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU boasts about having a trade and aid approach to international solidarity. Indeed that is something we aim to do and we also have the necessary policy instruments. The EU Member States make up 15 of the 21 importing country members of the International Coffee Organisation. That makes us a key player in the market and with key responsibilities to the coffee-producing countries. We welcome the fact that in November the Council gave serious consideration to this issue of coffee dependency. However, since then very little has happened, in spite of the fact that the Commission has joined and echoed that support for an ICO quality programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the communication, which clearly is not now going to be on the table in time for the ICO and world high-level round-table meeting in London. We called for that in our resolution and we regret that it clearly is not going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, despite the state of the market, the coffee companies are doing very well, thank you. In the free market their global reach gives them unprecedented options. Ten years ago coffee-producing countries received around one-third of every dollar spent on coffee. Now it is less than eight cents. Last year in Uganda I met a farmer who was selling a kilogram of her coffee beans for 150 Ugandan shillings. Later on I paid <span class="italic">1 000</span> Ugandan shillings in the Sheraton Hotel for just one cup of coffee! The four big companies together buy almost half the coffee beans produced around the world. The roaster companies must take greater responsibility for paying farmers a fair price for what they grow, to enable them to send their children to school, pay for health care and just put food on the table. There is terrible human suffering at the heart of the coffee business and we must put pressure on the companies to do more and care more. The EU has real authority in the ICO and we have a responsibility in the round-table meeting to hammer out policies which will give the farmers an opportunity to live their lives with dignity and financial security.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to know whether the Commission is preparing a specific action plan for this meeting, because just turning up simply will not be enough. We want a statement and an action plan. I also want to know – and that again is in our resolution – whether we will be sending a high-level representative. Is the Commissioner going? Is the Director-General going? At what level will the European Union be represented in order that we can have a clear and ambitious action plan? Then we can all continue to enjoy an excellent cup of the world's most popular drink – coffee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the coffee market is currently undergoing a serious crisis. Coffee sector workers are no longer able to make a living from production. Market prices, set by the four main multinationals, which make indecent profits, are too low to allow farmers to make the profits they need in order to continue their activity. Furthermore, as the coffee is being produced at too high a yield, its very quality is declining.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the absence of an international system to stabilise coffee prices and prices of raw materials in general, the situation of coffee farmers is not viable. We must put an end to this spiral of productivism, which, in defiance of any social or environmental legislation, is leading to poverty for millions of farmers in poor countries. Some might say it is simply a coincidence that this crisis is taking place now that the Stabex system has disappeared from the Cotonou agreement. The new rapid payment system, furthermore, makes it impossible to help coffee-producing countries. As the main importer of coffee, the European Union bears the main responsibility in resolving this crisis. The European Union must set up an urgent programme, financed with the funds remaining from previous EDFs, in order to make up the shortfall in revenue of the people and countries concerned. We call on the Commission to produce a communication on basic products as a matter of urgency. Similarly, the Commission must support the International Coffee Organisation’s quality-improvement programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, the European Union must implement, for example within the framework of national and regional development plans, a range of measures designed to combat the volatility of coffee prices and prices of other basic products. The European Union must support diversification in Southern farmers’ production and high-quality agriculture, and contribute to increasing the power of coffee farmers against the agri-foods industries. In particular, the Commission must support the establishment of fair trade structures and facilitate market access for fair trade products. A Commission communication on this matter is becoming increasingly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of stabilising prices for raw materials, upon which the majority of the least developed countries depend, must be approached in the context of multilateral trade negotiations. The ‘development round’ instigated at Doha seems particularly appropriate, if we want developing countries to benefit genuinely from world trade, which is currently more to their disadvantage. The customs tariffs that are still in force for coffee products must therefore be removed. The European Union must use all its power at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to ensure that trade with developing countries becomes fairer. Furthermore, we welcome the French proposal to add the matter of raw materials to the agenda for the next G8 summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As major coffee companies, Nestlé, Kraft, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble cannot continue to get away with lining their pockets. They must agree to adopt codes of ethical practice in agreement with the ILO and the UN and pay a fair price for raw materials, a price that reflects the social and environmental costs of coffee–growing and production. If farmers and workers in the coffee sector are to receive fair remuneration, fair trade is not just another option but the only sustainable global solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it is those who are putting such pressure on prices that farmers are scarcely earning anything from the coffee they produce.</p>
<p class="contents">How can they get away with it? At a meeting in the European Parliament to debate the coffee crisis, Louis Belinda from Uganda gave the following answer. ‘We have no alternative to coffee growing,’ he said. ‘We have given fisheries a try, but EU regulations prevented that. We have experimented with traditional agriculture, but EU exports of meat and milk at dumping prices mean that we cannot even sell our goods to other African countries. We have had a go with sugar, but the EU’s export subsidy did not give us a chance.’</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, not true, Commissioner Liikanen, that everything but arms solves the problem, for the EU’s agricultural policy destroys coffee growers’ ability to diversify into other forms of work. The EU is therefore largely responsible for the fact that 25 million coffee growers are now threatened with extreme poverty, all the more so because the EU itself gave the developing countries the fatal advice to pin their hopes on coffee production. The EU must and shall fulfil its responsibilities in this area. The Development Fund has a surplus of DKK 7 500 million, so why does the EU hesitate to act while the coffee growers go hungry?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman had a solution involving mushrooms. I think that idea sounded very interesting, and I hope the Commission will look into it.</p>
<p class="contents">The coffee growers must, however, be guaranteed a minimum income here and now. That could happen by subsidising institutions such as the Max Havelaar one, but the EU should also, as quickly as possible, increase the coffee producers’ own influence on the market by strengthening their negotiating capacity – through supporting the development of cooperatives – and by giving them the opportunity to come up with better products and to be given access to credits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite immoral that the international coffee giants can be allowed to exploit the crisis in order further to increase their surpluses, which are already too high.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like some answers to the questions put by Mrs Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coffee is one of the basic products that constitute exports, and for many poor, heavily indebted countries, it is the main source of income. Countries such as Burundi, Ethiopia and Uganda rely on coffee exports for more than 50% of their income.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of the world coffee market, therefore, is not a secondary, minor issue. It is at the very heart of world injustice, which condemns millions of people to poverty and distress. In this regard, the coffee crisis is clear proof of the failure of the world policy of aggravated liberalisation and prioritising market forces. In fact, it is the international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO that encourage these countries to follow an economic policy oriented towards the external market. Suffocated by debt and subject to the orders of the IMF, which can sometimes act as the world moneylender, these countries throw themselves wholeheartedly into production in sectors in which they possess a relative advantage in relation to the developed countries. In the case of coffee, this advantage is favourable climatic conditions. The WTO then promises them free access to the world market. Due to the law of supply and demand, however, market value is unstable and, when prices fall, the multinationals that control the market take steps to preserve their profit margins. The entire drop in the market value is therefore passed on to small farmers and plantation workers, so much so that consumers in developed countries do not even see a drop in the price of their cup of coffee. Not to mention working conditions for women and child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been proven. An end to world injustice cannot be achieved by greater liberalisation, more free trade or increased deregulation – quite the opposite. What coffee farmers need is an international coffee market that is regulated to a greater degree, to prevent overproduction taking hold, so that the quality of products is guaranteed and controlled, so that profits in this sector are divided fairly and so that decent working conditions are guaranteed. Let us hope that we remember this lesson at the next round table of the International Coffee Organisation, at the next G8 summit and, most importantly, at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September. We shall continue to be extremely vigilant, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How could we fail to be aware of this since these prices are the lowest in real terms that have been recorded for the past century? All the political groupings are aware of the disastrous impact that this fall in coffee prices will have on the economy of a number of the poorest countries in the world. At the same time, however, we are all raising our hands to the heavens as a sign of impotence and proposing that a particular international summit should add the issue to the agenda, and giving good advice on retraining or diversification, and proposing lessons in popularisation for the peasants we are suffocating, and we are calling for a little something to be released to help the worst affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, four international trusts, – Nestlé, Kraft, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble – control half of all world coffee sales. In other words, this means that prices are established by these four trusts. They are the ones that reduce the price paid to farmers in order to make ever-increasing profits. In order to pay greater dividends to their shareholders, they bring hardship to dozens of poor countries and therefore to tens of millions of peasants and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I have observed that the European Parliament and the Heads of State are powerless to stop these four trusts and, instead, merely call for charity. The common resolution, however, dares to recommend an increase in the power of coffee farmers on the market. As if poor peasants in Rwanda, Ethiopia or Haiti could oppose Nestlé and its counterparts, when the European Parliament does not dare to do so! If that is not hypocritical, I do not know what it is. The simple fact that the common resolution mentions the four coffee trusts responsible for price reductions makes the representatives of the ELDR group’s skin crawl, so much so that they are calling for the paragraph that mentions the trusts to be deleted. Go ahead and conceal the names of these trusts, since I cannot bear to look at them! Parliament is full of hypocrites!</p>
<p class="contents">What is true for coffee is also true for the other raw materials, particularly oil. Those who have bombed Iraq, killing civilians, women and children claim they are doing so in order to free Iraq from its dictator. Saddam Hussein, however, who butchered his own people, was their henchman for years. They are the ones who provided him with weapons and encouraged him in the war against Iran. They are the ones who sold him weapons to massacre and gas the Kurds, and people have the gall to present the invading troops as liberators when all they are doing is carrying out the dirty work of the oil and weapons trusts.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to put an end to this pillaging of the planet to increase the wealth of a few trusts, in order to put an end to the flagrant inequality between the wealthy in wealthy countries and the poor in poor countries, and in order to prevent the poor being starved to death or being massacred in wars designed to preserve this situation, we have absolutely no other option but to put an end to the international economic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Speaking towards the end of this debate it is inevitable that I will repeat many of the themes that my colleagues have already raised here this morning. However, that demonstrates the strength and the unity of concern in this Parliament about this issue and our serious determination to do something more about it. The current situation where coffee prices are the lowest in real terms for at least 100 years, leaves, as others have said, more than 25 million poor families facing ruin, unable to put enough food on the table, unable to send their children to school, unable to buy the most basic medicines. At the same time four companies control over half of world coffee sales and their revenues have been spiralling upwards to over USD 100 billion a year, at the same time as some of the poorest families in the world have seen their incomes disappear into nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House often face disasters with feelings of hopelessness, of powerlessness; we wonder what can we do about this and we cannot necessarily think of anything. However, on this occasion it is very different: there is plenty the European Union could and should be doing to address this particular issue. The EU has the resources and the policies to make a positive difference to these families, as well as the responsibility to do so. EU Member States account for 15 of the 21 importing country members of the International Coffee Organisation. We account for almost half of all the world's coffee imports. That gives us enormous potential leverage, and we should be using it. All that seems to be lacking right now is the political will, and the Commission should be demonstrating an awareness of greater urgency and more obvious commitment to do something about it as the crisis in the world coffee market escalates into an international disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">So we look forward to this communication on commodities which the Commission has promised. We also want to see some more immediate measures. We welcome Commissioner Nielson's commitment, in November of last year, to examine the possibilities of freeing up and reallocating old EDF money. We have EUR 11 billion in unspent commitments from the sixth, seventh and eighth EDFs. This gives us the resources to make a real difference, and we should focus on quick-dispersing initiatives which are designed to provide decentralised budget support to coffee-growing areas, to ameliorate the effects of the coffee crisis on access to health care and education. We need to provide additional financial support to ACP governments, commensurate to the revenue that they are losing from the current coffee crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also needs to give greater support to fair-traded coffee and better access for such coffee to EU markets. Equally significantly, the issue of coffee illustrates the wider issues of commodities prices and the collapse of those prices. Why is that issue not on the WTO agenda? Many people criticise the WTO as having an agenda that is focussed towards the North and not the South. The fact that commodity prices are not on the agenda underlines that perception. I would like to ask the Commissioner this: will the Commission support the proposal of East Africa to place commodities on the next WTO agenda in Cancun, so that we can demonstrate that this so-called Doha development round is more than just rhetoric, it is action as well? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The North exploits monocultures and, in order to put itself at an advantage, helps itself to the raw materials they produce, at minimum prices, under the most adverse conditions, and in a poverty-stricken environment. Consumers' spending habits and consumer policy within the European Union also have to be borne in mind here.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies support the consumers' desire for raw materials from developing countries at the lowest possible prices, whilst our own agricultural policies are defended with extraordinary vigour and – I am still being polite – we concentrate on keeping prices stable. It is inevitable that such an incongruity must come to an end, and this must form part of an action plan on the part of the European Union. In essence, economic relations are limited to the exploitation of raw materials, coffee being only one example of this, whilst these materials are processed and utilised, thus acquiring added value through the production process, within the industrialised countries. For as long as this incongruity persists, the economic relationship between the countries of the North and of the South will be beset by constant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about diversification, and rightly too, for this is an important requirement, but it must also be given substance. It is not enough to consider this concept in isolation and see it as the cure for all ills. We must also ask what shape this diversification is to take, and let me make clear that this will involve the possibility of raw materials being processed in the developing country in which they were produced, where, at the very least, semi-manufactured goods should also be produced, for these are the means by which added value is created. This will also involve willingness on our part to pay a proper price for them. Where, for example, in the European Union's institutions, can you find fairly traded coffee?</p>
<p class="contents">Where, too, in the political institutions of our Member States? In which of this Parliament's bars and restaurants is fairly traded coffee served? I could give any number of examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Any action plan by the Commission must of necessity include a proposal as to how goods can be fairly traded under present conditions. I cannot see that there is a conclusive concept for this, one that would right now allow the farmers a truly fair share in their products if the existing fair trade infrastructure were to be put to use and extended. In this area, we owe a debt to the developing countries. I very much hope that this will meet with a response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will, however, make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">You must remember that the real problem with the coffee sector is the lack of demand. The supply is essentially about the demand, and for that reason trade negotiations are not the only solution. It is very important that discussions in the World Bank/ICO context, or in ICO itself, lead to solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's problem is that the United States, which is the second biggest coffee consumer, is outside the ICO. Unless the US is ready to reconsider its position in the context of ICO, then the measures will not have the same international impact.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for an action plan before the next meeting and the level of Commission participation are concerned, I will pass Mrs Kinnock's questions to Mr Lamy and Mr Nielson. I am sure they will reply accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
