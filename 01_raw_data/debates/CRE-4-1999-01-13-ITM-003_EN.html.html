<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mulder </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, may I begin by welcoming Mr Funke to the House. I think it is a good tradition that the President of the Council of Ministers always takes the trouble to attend when we hold important debates on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the financing of the agriculture dimension of Agenda 2000, I think it is a good thing to be continuing the trend of recent years. If agriculture policy changes, the funding of it naturally has to change as well. The Committee on Agriculture broadly endorses the Commission"s proposals. The EAGGF must remain the principal source of funding for the common agricultural policy. As with the MacSharry reforms of a few years ago, we think it is a good thing to modify its content. Just as the MacSharry reforms for the first time introduced a budget line which had little to do with policy on markets and prices as such, this time too all manner of new chapters are being added.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there is a chapter on rural development, and the Agriculture Committee finds that this makes sense. Agriculture policy is no longer just a policy on prices and markets, but an all‐embracing policy which includes policy on the countryside. Secondly, the Commission is also proposing that veterinary and phytosanitary measures should be included. That seems logical to us. Thirdly, there is information policy. The Commission proposes to include that too. This is likewise welcomed by the Agriculture Committee. We think that in general the CAP is not sufficiently well regarded in Europe. We need to highlight its positive aspects – and there are plenty of those.</p>
<p class="contents">What the European Commission"s proposals do not include, and the Committee on Agriculture is adding this, is any mention of a policy on agricultural product quality. If there is one thing Europe needs after the BSE crisis and all the fuss over the quality of foods, it is for Europe to devise a policy for the quality of agricultural products. That has to be an key part of European farm policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agriculture Committee also thinks that in future too, farmers must be able to get their prices from the market as far as possible. Filling in a pile of forms is not all that helpful. What they want is a better price. That can be secured by a policy on quality, but also by developing other markets, namely the market in non‐food uses of agricultural products. As far as the environment is concerned, it will be very useful if we can legislate for the use of certain farm products in certain areas. That will open up new markets, and prices may pick up as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to European enlargement, we have no quarrel with the fact that some measure of pre‐accession assistance is also included in the regulation. As far as Parliament"s powers are concerned, all spending on markets and prices policy must remain compulsory expenditure, we accept that. Given that Parliament has to have a voice in all other spending, this must be non‐compulsory expenditure, because Parliament has full power of codecision on that.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in the view of the Agriculture Committee, should not be in the Guarantee Fund? All the structural measures under Objective 1 and Community initiatives. Management of the funds must of course remain under the control of the Commission itself. Where monies are disbursed by Member States through the payment agencies, they must be scrutinised by the Member States. In view of this week"s events, it will come as no surprise that we want that scrutiny to be greatly improved. We have to have better scrutiny. And how do we see that scrutiny? The Commission"s proposal is for a report on the financial accounts three months after the end of the financial year, and for a policy review after two years. The Agriculture Committee has tabled a number of amendments to improve things here. We want to be told straight away, not two years later, if something has been rejected or approved. We want to have our finger firmly on the pulse of any developments in that area. We want the Commission to report to us on this every three months. This does not need to be a weighty tome. We have enough reading to do already, but it must be provided as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have a comment on one contentious point in our proposal, namely the cofinancing of certain agricultural expenditure. It includes a recital in which the Agriculture Committee is cautiously in favour of that cofinancing, but there was a tied vote on whether or not to include an article on this. Eighteen members of the Agriculture Committee were in favour of cofinancing for certain types of expenditure, 18 were against and one member abstained. So this is something which the plenary will have to decide in its ultimate wisdom.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Garot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my report on beef and veal, due care was taken to ensure that three vital points were taken into account. The first is that new consumer expectations have emerged as a result of the mad cow phenomenon, expectations which focus on product quality in terms of taste and health. The second is the need to correct the structural imbalances of the market, where there is an annual 2 % increase in supply and a 1 % fall in demand. The third is the validity of the Cunha report which Parliament adopted and which advocates reconciling the economic dimension of agricultural activity with its social, environmental and territorial role.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as everyone has discovered, the Commission"s proposals advocate a reform in which these three concerns are not central. In fact the Commission firstly intends to increase the European Union"s share of world markets and bring European prices closer to those of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The approach favoured in this case, contrary to previous reforms, means that it is moving towards market regulation through price control, which is why it is proposing to lower the intervention price by 30 % and abandon the public intervention system. I, for my part, am of the opinion that if we are to be realistic about this situation we have to think in terms of future European beef and veal production as being primarily linked to the European market, with external markets acting increasingly as limited markets for disposing of surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Asian and Russian crises reveal the Commission"s excessive confidence in international markets this option appears increasingly viable. The relevance of the Commission"s trade strategy for the beef and veal sector has not been decisively demonstrated. It is a sector in which our production costs are twice as high as in Argentina and three times as high as in New Zealand. In this context, accelerated moves towards alignment with world prices is likely to have detrimental effects on a large number of European Union cattle farmers which would of course be inadmissible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the proposals I have submitted for debate combine a reasonable price reduction with proactive management of volumes, the essential promotion of a food policy and the need to maintain decent incomes for producers. As regards the lowering of prices, I am proposing a 15 % reduction to stimulate consumption and maintain a correct competitive relationship with white meat, which will benefit from a reduction in cereal prices. In terms of production control, I am proposing that measures advocated by the Commission to increase extensification aid, implement veal calf premiums, encourage carcase weight reductions and introduce individual quotas for the male bovine premium, be further enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to food policy and in addition to the innovative measures in the packaging and presentation of meat products, efforts should focus on restoring consumer confidence. In this respect, it is obviously by placing demands for high quality products in terms of taste and health at the centre of the COM that we will be able to restore consumer confidence in them. Lastly, as regards cattle farmers" income, a 15 % reduction and vital production cuts are set to further exacerbate their situation, which therefore gives rise to the issue of compensation. I proposed to deal with this within the budget set for this COM in Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which was put to a vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in December, was not adopted, probably for reasons which go beyond its content. And yet, majority votes were obtained on a number of issues: 15 % price reduction, maintaining public intervention, uprating aid for suckler cow herds and extensification, the need for veal calf premiums and maintaining the deseasonalisation premium.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore highlighted these elements so as to propose them with my political group, the PSE Group, to the House. Then, new amendments are aimed at solving the problems posed by Italy, Germany and Holland regarding the treatment of young male bovines. The essential measure put forward in this connection consists of putting aside a sum of ECU 1 800 million, in the form of extra payments, to grant a slaughter premium for male bovines, suckler cows, dairy cows, heifers and veal calves. Such a premium would be allocated on the basis of Community criteria of a slaughter ceiling for each country, determined on historic bases, and a premium ceiling per animal for each of the categories mentioned, so as to avoid distorting competition between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise should restore the balance that countries which produce male bovines have waited for, without calling into question the core element of the measure taken to enable the necessary adjustments to be made to the COM in beef and veal. This is why, Madam President, I think that the conditions are now right for Parliament to adopt this report in the near future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Goepel </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office, the Commission"s proposals on the organisation of the market in milk cover three main areas: price support, income support for milk producers, and the provision on guaranteed quantities. The Commission"s proposals on price support provide for a reduction in the price of milk of 17 %, and a reduction in the intervention prices for both butter and skimmed milk powder of 15 %. These measures are proposed in order to encourage the consumption of milk and milk products in the Community, and to improve the competitiveness of these products on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the proposed amount of compensation, the price reduction should, however, be substantially smaller overall than the Commission is seeking. With a smaller price reduction and with amounts of compensation remaining the same, it will be easier to achieve full compensation for loss of income. We therefore propose reducing the target price for milk by 12 % instead of 17 %, and the intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder by 10 % instead of 15 % in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to income compensation, the Commission is proposing four components: a dairy cow premium (Article 15), an additional payment (Article 16), a supplement to the dairy cow premium (Article 12) and an additional payment within the limits of global amounts (Article 13). These proposals are extremely complicated and will lead to serious implementation and monitoring problems. In principle, however, I am in favour of the dairy cow premium together with a supplement under the beef and veal regulation, but not on the basis of a virtual European cow yielding 5 800 kg of milk per year; the basis of this cow premium must instead be financial compensation based on the amount of quota, and national or regional animal yields must guarantee full compensation. A general slaughter premium for dairy cows might also be considered – as a second strand of the organisation of the market in beef and veal – to make up for the price reduction. In practice, we would thus have two forms of premium with which to provide compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as regards the provisions on guaranteed quantities, we support the Commission"s proposal to extend the quota until 2006 and, rather more reluctantly, the proposed 2 % increase in quotas. In allocating 1 % to young farmers and 1 % to producers in mountain areas, however, it should also be possible, in the latter case, to take account of less‐favoured mountain areas, although only as far as the quantity allocated is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">When discussing a reform of the organisation of the market in milk, we cannot avoid the problem of the additional levy. I propose that it should be reduced by more than the reduction already achieved through the drop in the target price for milk, and that it should be structured flexibly, almost as an economic instrument, so that an active milk producer would have the possibility of adjusting the quota for his holding to the economic situation, either through leasing or by going over quota. That would certainly influence the market price for quota leasing to the disadvantage of the so‐called ‘armchair milkers", and European milk producers and the dairy industry would, despite the quota arrangements, have the possibility of selling more dairy products on the world market without the payment of export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">On linking land and quotas, all I have to say is that one reason for the growth in leased quotas is the fact that both EC and national law allow non‐producers to possess a quota of these quotas. Another is the principle of linking quotas to areas of land. In my view, the question as to whether or not quotas should be tied to land – that is, transfer of milk quota only with a partial transfer of land – should be decided in the individual Member States themselves; there should therefore be an optional arrangement. Article 7(2) should, then, establish the optional suspension of the link between quotas and land, authorising Member States to introduce regional restrictions on the transfer of reference quantities without land.</p>
<p class="contents">Two days ago, it was reported by DPA that the presidency and the Commission were both convinced that all the Member States had to show a willingness to compromise, and that national interests should be represented impartially and clearly. That is precisely what I wanted to do here as rapporteur – to be impartial, but clear. In principle, I agree with the Commission that the competitiveness of European farming on the world market needs to be increased. However, I would say to Commissioner Fischler and President‐in‐Office Funke that I cannot cleverly boost competitiveness on the one hand, and at the same time, by clobbering farmers with step‐by‐step reductions, exclude whole regions of eastern Germany from this competition on the other. Jobs in agriculture are to be found in particular on mixed farms, producing beef, veal and pigmeat, but above all milk. You should give these families the same chance as all the others in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am grateful to have been given the opportunity as a Member of this House – almost ten years after German unification – to have a hand in the reorganisation of such an important market. I especially wish to thank those who did the groundwork for me and who have supported me in this complicated, but interesting work.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fantuzzi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Madam President, I was not entirely happy with some of the amendments made to my report in the Agriculture Committee, such as the one aiming not to reduce intervention prices for cereals but to increase aid nonetheless. It makes little sense to me to increase internal support, at an additional cost of some hundreds of millions of euros, in a sector which – although it accounts for 11 % of gross saleable agricultural production in the Community – alone consumes 40 % of the CAP budget, in other words EUR 17 billion out of 40. I hope the Christmas break has given everyone time to reflect, and that the vote in Brussels on 28 January will lead to a revision of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced, on the contrary, that a 20 % reduction in the intervention price – I shall be proposing 15 % – is not an irrational display of pessimism on the part of DG VI officials. The gap between the intervention price and the world price is wider than that at present; thus the reduction proposed through Agenda 2000 should be even greater, strictly speaking, as the President of the Court of Auditors reminded us in this House a few weeks ago. Indeed, the spectre of surpluses, which we thought had been banished in 1992, is rearing its ugly head again in the Community: all it took was a 2 % better harvest and a set‐aside rate of 5 %, and here we are already now with cereals surpluses of some 20 million tonnes. I fear that, if we continue along this road, the forecasts for 2006 will have to be revised upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we wish to be serious and responsible, a thorough, far‐reaching reform is urgently needed. It is useless to turn a blind eye; I believe that the phoney reforms which you have outlined, Mr Fischler, would upset no one but would leave us once again with production surpluses. So there is no point in deferring the problem, because it would then have to be tackled as an emergency in the near future, under much more adverse conditions than now. For cereals, we can avoid this danger if we deal with the sector in the manner suggested by the Commission. This is in any event my own opinion. Of course certain rectifications are needed, three at least. The first consists in excluding oilseeds from the single premium. We have a protein deficit in the Community, and it has become increasingly acute since the BSE crisis; it is absurd to invoke the Blair House constraints to claim that, with this reduction in the basic premium, we shall no longer have to suffer them. That is rather like rejoicing when we hurt ourselves, because in that way we no longer feel pain inflicted on us by others. Let us take the bull by the horns, Commissioner, without taking make‐believe, dangerous short‐cuts. In other words, let us renegotiate Blair House!</p>
<p class="contents">The second rectification needed is a set‐aside rate of 10 %. Its proposed abolition in 2000 is unrealistic. Even now we could certainly do with a positive set‐aside rate, because of the market difficulties already highlighted and in order to ensure that the set‐aside system functions effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The third rectification lies in demonstrating greater solidarity and cohesion in the COM for arable crops than currently exists. If the Commission itself acknowledges in its introductory statement that the CAP reform of 1992 has not worked to the advantage of less favoured regions and producers in respect of arable crops – the most significant item of expenditure, representing the bulk of direct income support – we cannot remain hidebound by the logic of 1992. I propose that, in order to start redressing the balance, our frame of reference for productivity should be a weighted average of one third to two thirds of – respectively – average Community production and the traditional yield of a given region.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these rectifications will be accepted; looking to the future, they would make aid more justifiable in social terms. I believe that these aspects should also be included in other reports on Agenda 2000, for example the one on the horizontal regulation. This is an important opportunity to bring the CAP into line with consumers' and citizens' needs. Eco‐compatibility, ceilings and differentiation are not intellectual flights of fancy, but much‐needed elements to ensure that the mother of all Community policies has some sort of a future. Otherwise it will not survive. With EUR 40 billion earmarked for 7.5 million individuals, when twice that number are out of work, economic arguments alone are ultimately no longer enough unless they are accompanied by the environmental, social and territorial considerations for which society is pressing hard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the outcome of this discussion in the House. I fear that, by pulling out all the stops to protect producers, we shall ultimately much dilute the Commission's already tentative new proposals and rule out innovation altogether. It cannot be maintained that because of the crisis in Russia or eastern Asia we should reject or review the reduction in cereals, milk and meat prices. I have never believed in ‘fortress Europe'. For Europeans to shut the door to the outside world has always been a mistake: it is precisely at times of crisis that Europe must be a little more adventurous and assert its presence on the world stage. This is not unquestioning confidence in international markets but self‐confidence; otherwise there is no point in launching the euro to stand up and be counted in the world. What is more, such a defensive stance sends a most unfortunate message to the CEECs, to the other Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It really is paradoxical that Agenda 2000, launched in order to bring the two halves of Europe together, is now dividing them. Unfortunately, Mr Funke, the Agriculture Council has not impressed us with its far‐sightedness over the past few months. The Agriculture Council itself deserves a motion of censure. It has been treading water for weeks on the reform of the CAP, rehearsing the same old arguments time and time again: the agricultural model, the two pillars. This has not amounted to much, and has left the field clear for the ECOFIN Council, whose theories on cofinancing and expenditure freezes have complicated and even seriously jeopardised the reform's future. Let us avoid wars of words here too: to say ‘no' to cofinancing in the name of Community solidarity is to sow discord; to discuss it seriously is another matter, and means assessing all the implications. The tendency to compare net contributions and a reluctance to stump up for the poor countries of the south will not bring much progress in Europe, in my view. What is more, to turn the CAP as it stands into a monument to the inviolable principle of solidarity is an insult to common sense. Whatever anyone may say, the CAP is certainly not the best example of Community solidarity; one need only look at the level of support granted to production in Mediterranean areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Minister, we should like you to explain this new enthusiasm for a zero‐cost reform. If we wish to curb expenditure and tackle the structural difficulties of excessive, uneven support leading to distortion, the way to do so in my opinion is to enact more radical reforms, not to preserve the status quo. It would be galling to discover, after March, that what lies behind the slogan of zero‐cost reform is the umpteenth postponement of any reform. The last thing that farmers need is for everything to be deferred until October.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graefe zu Baringdorf </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, I should first like to provide a formal clarification: I am speaking here as rapporteur of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as all the other previous speakers have also done so far. I am not, therefore, giving my own opinion or that of my group, but that of the committee. We have the unusual situation in the Agriculture Committee that in many areas no decisions were made at all, that is, that there was no position of any kind, except that of rejecting the Commission"s position. I was lucky, however, in my appointment as rapporteur because, Mr Fischler, I can congratulate you: the committee has approved in full the Commission"s proposal on direct support schemes and their modulation. I am, therefore, in a position to report on your proposal here and to explain it. I shall, however, try to make a better job of doing so than you did in your remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis for this proposal is of course the premiums, which were introduced in 1992 in the so‐called MacSharry reform – as yet we have not heard much of the Fischler reform; we still need to introduce that – when prices were lowered and it was said that compensatory payments would be made in the form of premiums. These compensatory payments were not linked to quality, which, logically speaking, was right, because the amount paid out was, of course, supposed to be the same as that by which prices had fallen. The fact that this was not quite correct and that, overall, agriculture lost out somewhat, is something we discussed at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of these changes was, of course, considerable. Let me quote the European Court of Auditors. The Court writes in its investigation that a point was reached where 40 % of these premiums were going to 4 % of holdings. And then a point was reached where 80 % of these premiums were going to 20 % of holdings and where, for example – according to the Court of Auditors – one leading holding received DEM 6.61 million from Brussels in one year. That meant that some holdings were in a position to pay their rent and labour costs out of the premiums and still had money left over. Of course, for the holdings which were less well provided for, this is an extremely difficult situation, because the former are of course far better able to withstand price reductions than the latter. The Commission has therefore said – and in the committee we think this is right – that this has to be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the payment of premiums more dependent on criteria such as employment and the environment, and take greater account of these factors. So far, the committee agrees. Now, contrary to the Court of Auditors, which actually said that direct payments above ECU 100 000 should be stopped completely – that is, capped – you have rightly, like the committee, come out in favour of a sliding scale. The intention is for 20 % to be deducted between ECU 100 000 and ECU 200 000, and 25 % above ECU 200 000. That would be the level set by Brussels. Then you say that it is now up to the Member States to make further deductions of up to 20 % for holdings which have a below‐average number of workers, or in other words have reached a much more advanced stage of rationalisation than other holdings. That would therefore give a reduction of up to 45 %.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is based on a reasonable approach, because it makes employment a factor in the payment of the premium, albeit in a standardised form and not in the form of remuneration for the actual work done. But this would still mean that highly rationalised holdings would see their premiums reduced, and holdings with a large number of employees would receive a higher payout. The only problem with the whole scheme is that only around 1 % – or perhaps not even that – of holdings are affected and that the vast majority of agricultural holdings do not stand to gain anything from this sliding scale, because obviously the reductions made higher up do not necessarily benefit those lower down.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, with your permission I will outline the proposal we tabled in the Agriculture Committee; it was not voted on, but was reported in the Commission – at least unofficially – to be a better proposal than yours. I am not allowed to report on it as such, because the Agriculture Committee has of course decided otherwise, but I should nevertheless like to touch upon it. We could in fact say that very high administrative expenditure is required for the holdings to prove that they are not working to full capacity. This might lead to legal disputes and cause difficulties. That is why we have proposed giving the holdings an option: we deduct 45 % straightaway, and then holdings with a large number of employees may voluntarily submit evidence of their labour costs, 50 % of which are offset. Calculations showed that under these arrangements, 97 % of holdings would be wholly unaffected. We therefore create a mechanism for holdings which have a large number of employees and which use ecologically sound farming methods. The two usually go hand in hand. We give holdings of this kind more than we give holdings which have undergone a process of rationalisation. That seems to me to be very sensible. The other holdings are competitive anyway because they have reached such an advanced stage of rationalisation. Thank you, Madam President. I will save the rest for when I speak for my group and on my own account.</p>

At the same time the document does not, however, pay sufficient attention to other uses of farm land. It would be sensible to invest in the increased cultivation of crops for energy, as an alternative use for land.</p>
<p class="contents">In rural areas important work, for both nature and the economy, is to be found in the production of bioenergy. The benefits of bioenergy are that it is renewable, clean, localised, and it provides employment. So far indirect regional, national and environmental benefits have tended to provide the incentive, rather than direct economic benefits. The adoption of developed technology has brought new opportunities for the exploitation of bioenergy, and that will allow us, in the future, to increase our level of self‐sufficiency in energy production in Europe. More investment in bioenergy product development will also bring with it a vital economic benefit in relation to other energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the implementation of the Kyoto agreement on climate the Commission has announced its objective to double the use of renewables in the Union area by the year 2010. Recognition of the non‐food option in Agenda 2000 would also prove that the Commission meant business. The production of bioenergy as a cheap source of power will need support, along with that given to other alternative energy sources in the future, for it to gain the status we intend for it as part of European energy policy. Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for his hard and time‐consuming work.</p>

<p class="contents">Within the proposals for agricultural reform, the top priority is the Union"s commitment to maintaining some viable rural communities and to protecting European rural heritage. In order to do so, it must have a very strong and competitive agricultural sector at global level that operates within a framework of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission has set out its proposals on direct support schemes within the common agricultural policy relating to all common organisations of the market that grant direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal for a regulation in question, the Committee on Budgetary Control calls on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to incorporate three amendments that have the common objective of ensuring that Parliament is better informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal is based on the principle of subsidiarity. Without wishing to question this approach, it is important that the measures adopted to guarantee payments to farmers benefiting from these schemes are accompanied by a certain degree of coordination at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of penalties applied to farmers who do not meet labour or environmental standards must be applied for the same reasons in all Member States and should be similar throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission wants this proposal for a regulation to be implemented by the management committees in which the Council and the Commission are involved yet which Parliament is excluded from. On this same theme, I should like to point out that Parliament approved a resolution in September in which we asked that we be guaranteed real control over the implementing measures. For this reason, the Committee on Budgetary Control stresses that the Commission must inform Parliament of the measures Member States adopt in applying this regulation. Moreover, before the final decision is adopted, Parliament should have the right to contribute, for a limited period of time, to the debate on the Commission"s proposals on the implementing measures.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funke, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first thank you very much for your warm welcome and for giving me the opportunity to be here in the European Parliament for my first, as it were, official appointment as President‐in‐Office of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, and to address you. I should like to outline the German Presidency"s priorities on agriculture and fisheries; I hope that Parliament will be a constructive partner in this work and will actively support us in the quite enormous project we have ahead of us. As you know, we are also under pressure of time because, of course, parliamentary elections are on the horizon. I am setting great store by your cooperation, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, you will be debating the agricultural component of Agenda 2000. I have followed the deliberations hitherto in the European Parliament"s committees and plenary closely – and in this respect I am also grateful that I was able to hear what each of the rapporteurs had to say today – and I conclude, although this will certainly come as no surprise to you, that opinions do still diverge widely on the core issues. I therefore deduce that the German Presidency has its work cut out to reach an appropriate compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, if you include the question of financing, Agenda 2000 is the central political theme of the German Presidency as a whole. The federal government has set itself the goal of adopting Agenda 2000 in its entirety as early as this spring. This is a truly ambitious task and it will only be achieved if Parliament, the Commission and the presidency work together constructively and in a spirit of mutual trust, and if they really want political success.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposals for the sector of agriculture and rural development are part of a package, and I welcome the fact that this is also how the European Parliament sees it. I would, therefore, earnestly request that you bring deliberations in Parliament to a close in good time, so that we can also stay on schedule in this respect. I believe that it is in both our interests to make a success of the Agenda and to make it clear to the people of Europe that the European institutions are not only capable of action but also of successful action, and that they can design policies for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January, Germany took over the presidency for the eleventh time since the foundation of the European Economic Community. The German Government is very conscious of the great responsibility this brings, especially when the projects on the table are, after all, of such great historical significance, such as paving the way for eastward enlargement and preparing for the WTO negotiations which will begin at the end of the year. That is also why concluding the negotiations on Agenda 2000 is our top priority. We can – and for this I am very grateful – build on the solid preparatory work carried out by the Austrian, but also the British and Luxembourg Presidencies. All the same, I must add that very intensive work will be required to overcome the differences of opinion – which are in part still considerable – and to reach a workable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the uncertainty over financing – and further intensive discussions will also be held on this – I will, as chairman of the Agriculture Council, lead the negotiations on the agriculture part of the Agenda on the basis of the Commission proposals. This is what was envisaged from the outset. In the meantime, we have set up a high‐level group, which started its deliberations this week, beginning in fact with beef and veal, and milk. It is intended that this group should prepare for negotiations in the Agriculture Council and demonstrate possible ways of reaching compromises, and that it should, therefore, prepare draft decisions to a very large extent.</p>
<p class="contents">At the federal government"s meeting with the Commission on Monday of this week in Bonn, Commissioner Fischler and I agreed that, if convincing alternatives are presented, the Commission is prepared to review its proposals and if necessary to table new ones. I welcome this and am extremely grateful to the Commissioner and his colleagues for giving this undertaking. For at the present stage of the negotiations, it is certainly still too early to speculate about compromises. I do not think that would be sensible. But it should be pointed out – and I fully endorse what Mr Goepel said – that all of us, despite the respective interests we hold at national level, must also be prepared to reach compromises; otherwise at the end of the day we will not have a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it clear, however, that I believe it is essential to safeguard the interests of European agriculture, to invest the European model of agriculture with tangible initiatives, and to bolster rural areas by encouraging sustainable development. In the future, European agriculture will have to be competitive in order to hold its own against international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, European market organisations ought to be reformed and geared more closely to the requirements of the market. I must add, however, that in so doing it still is, and will continue to be, up to us to maintain and further improve our high standards of environmental and consumer protection, and also – in the interests of fair competition – to ensure that these standards are adequately safeguarded in international trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Agriculture Council, I should like to work with the Commission towards further improving the status of environmental protection in agricultural policy, giving Member States and regions a greater say in policies on agriculture and rural areas, and making animal welfare and precautionary consumer protection integral parts of the common agricultural policy. Important ideas on these matters – for which I am extremely grateful – have emerged from the European Parliament; I am pleased about this and fully support its greater involvement, including in agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise once again the necessity in European politics of the trio – if I may express it thus – of the Council, the Commission and Parliament. I could of course list the members of the trio in any order: the Council, the Commission and Parliament; Parliament, the Council and the Commission – as you wish, the order should not make any difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Agenda 2000 will be the German Presidency"s main priority, alongside it are other important dossiers in the field of agriculture and fisheries, which should, if possible, also be completed. As always in the first half of the year, negotiations on agricultural prices are on the agenda, the importance of which has admittedly – as we all know – diminished. I would be grateful if Parliament were able to complete its deliberations on the outstanding Commission proposals within this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is to live up to the expectations of the consumer, Community law should be further developed on the basis of the Commission Green Paper. The entire food production chain needs to be regulated efficiently and consistently. We also want to make improvements in the field of organic farming, in terms of both production and marketing. In addition, we attach great importance to animal welfare and combating epizootic diseases. I might perhaps mention the most important animal welfare issues here. They are as follows: decisions on treating laying hens in battery cages in a way appropriate to their species; laying down standards for the carriage of animals by sea; continuing to specify minimum slaughtering standards; and incorporating the Council of Europe recommendation on animals kept for farming purposes into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating epizootic diseases is becoming increasingly important in the light of the growth of trade in live animals and the economic damage resulting from outbreaks of disease. In view of this, moves are being made to amend the directives on swine fever, foot and mouth disease and zoonoses. Those are my comments on the agricultural side.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to talk briefly about fisheries, because there too we have an extensive work programme. Of course the Agenda 2000 negotiations also affect the fisheries sector. Therefore, for example, a decision has to be made on the core issue of the future financing of fisheries support. Alongside this, negotiations need to be held on the regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, to ensure that this proposal is adopted by June 1999 at the latest. I am aiming to table the key political elements of this proposal for a decision as early as the March Fisheries Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the common fisheries policy needs to be further developed to ensure sustainable and balanced management of fish stocks. Discussions on continuing or renewing fisheries agreements with third countries are a further priority, as is the review of these agreements, which was initiated by the Council. The Fisheries Council will also be dealing with restructuring the common organisation of the market in fishery products.</p>
<p class="contents">That was a brief presentation of the German Presidency"s priorities and the work it will be doing on agricultural and fisheries policy. Obviously, in the ten minutes available to me I was only able to touch on some points very briefly. I am aware that I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat, but as this is my first speech and presentation in this House, perhaps I might be forgiven. I should like to assure you that as the President‐in‐Office of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I will continue – including within the so‐called informal trilogue – to seek an in‐depth exchange of views with the European Parliament. I believe it is necessary and I am convinced it is important.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to warn you straight away that I shall need rather more than ten minutes to comment on all the reports before the House today. If possible, however, I will try to save some time at the end of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly though, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs very warmly for the work they have done in the run‐up to today"s debate. The individual market organisations were dealt with in the reports of Mr Fantuzzi, Mr Garot and Mr Goepel, the horizontal regulation by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and the EAGGF regulation by Mr Mulder.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on the reform of the market in wine is on the agenda for February, and the reports on rural development and on pre‐accession aid were already dealt with in November. I do not, therefore, need to comment on those reports today, but I should like to make it clear that my thanks also go to the rapporteurs, Mr Görlach and Mr Sonneveld.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteurs, all of you have contributed to our being able, so far, to keep to our timetable for dealing with the Agenda 2000 proposals. Negotiations in the Council have now entered the decision‐making phase. The technical issues have been resolved and the newly created high‐level group started work this week. As soon as a political agreement is reached, the Commission will, in any case, make all the necessary arrangements, so that the legal texts can be adopted definitively before the parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Most farmers and farming unions now agree that reform of the common agricultural policy is unavoidable. The danger of further surpluses – despite growing demand on the international agriculture markets – the forthcoming WTO round and rising production potential, which will also increase considerably with eastward enlargement, are factors which are shaping the discussion on the future structure of market management policies. In addition, there is an important internal debate on what society demands of agriculture. The effects of agricultural production on the environment are part of this debate, as is the question of social criteria for agricultural policy and the desire for a better quality of life, be it through higher food safety and quality standards, or through sustainable development of rural areas and considering the purposes they serve for our society.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, as you know, encapsulated this approach in the concept of a ‘European model of agriculture". If this model is not to be doomed, however, we not only need to gear it more closely to consumers and the markets, we also need to strengthen policies on rural areas. I am therefore opposed to any attempts to adopt only a slimmed‐down reform or to leave important areas out of the reform. I do not believe in ruining the future prospects of farmers and the processing industry with half‐baked, and therefore ineffective measures, and running the risk of our being faced with another debate on reform in the near future. The question now is what the final reforms should consist of, so that we can equip European farming for the challenges ahead. The European Parliament has played an active part in finding an answer to this question, and has prepared a number of amendments in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now, therefore, comment on the most fundamental of the proposed amendments and explain my position on them. Let me start with financing. The transition from price support to direct income payments will not lead directly to savings in the agriculture budget. To start with, expenditure on the agricultural policy will even increase slightly. Crucial here are, however, the positive effects which the reform will have on the economy. Independent academic institutes estimate the increased cost to the budget to be between EUR 3 billion and EUR 4 billion, but put savings to the consumer at between EUR 10 billion and EUR 17 billion. That means a reduction in the consumer price index of between 0.3 % and 0.45 %, and thus an important contribution to stability in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important objective of our proposal for the new EAGGF regulation is, in the future, to use the Guarantee Section to finance rural development measures outside Objective 1 programmes. This is an attempt to take account of multifunctionality and would also make it easier to defend the common agricultural policy at international level. It is intended that the Guarantee Section should also finance a series of accompanying structural measures in the fisheries sector, specific veterinary and plant protection measures, and measures to provide information on the common agricultural policy, and overall that the existing legal provisions should be consolidated and simplified. I am pleased to see, Mr Mulder, that you support the proposal to extend financing by the EAGGF Guarantee Section in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the individual amendments you have proposed. The legal base for the regulation is Article 43 of the Treaty. A number of amendments seek to base it on Article 209 as well. But, Madam President, this proposal only relates to provisions specifically on EAGGF financing; basing this regulation on Article 209 as well is therefore superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments concern the issue of cofinancing for measures which are at present financed exclusively from the Community budget. This is a question of principle, which must be settled outside the agricultural regulations. The same goes for the question of whether agricultural expenditure should be classified as compulsory or non‐compulsory. These matters should be discussed in connection with the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that the amendment aimed at changing the budget year would actually simplify matters considerably. This would mean, however, that the budget year in which the change was made would last twelve and a half months, resulting in a one‐off cost to the budget of around EUR 800 million. The Commission can therefore only accept this amendment if it is clear where the extra money is going to come from.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments on the quality of agricultural products, there is no question in my mind either that measures to promote quality are becoming increasingly important. These can, however, already be financed under the Guarantee Section at the moment, and are indeed financed by it to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to promoting the use of renewable raw materials. If we were now to start specifically naming, as it were, every single measure which we think is important, then we would have to give a whole list, which does not actually make any sense either.</p>
<p class="contents">On the wish you expressed for financing under the Guarantee Section not to disrupt the management and implementation of measures not previously financed by the Guarantee Section, I should like to point out that financing the supporting measures from the 1992 reform out of the Guarantee Section has not caused any particular problems. It is true that the financial provisions on paying agencies and the clearance of accounts are different in the Guarantee Section, but I maintain that overall this is an advantage and can very easily be combined with structural financing. In addition, we intend to set up a special advance payment system for rural development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment emphasises that at the end of the year, non‐utilised appropriations from the Guarantee Section should be transferred to a special reserve for future years. This is an interesting idea, but the rules in the Financial Regulation for the Community budget do not allow it. This would contravene the principle of the annuality of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on the Mulder report, I should like to make it clear that I will take your request for regular information on decisions on the clearance of accounts into consideration. Similarly, I will include precise evaluation measures in the financing from the Guarantee Section.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to Mr Garot"s report on the beef and veal sector. I am grateful that you in this House think it is necessary for the package to include reform of this market organisation. It is well known that without a price adjustment, prospects for beef and veal on the home market are hopeless. It is also well known that WTO rules will – from the middle of 2000 – limit Community exports of beef and veal which are eligible for refunds to just 820 000 tonnes a year. If the European beef and veal industry is to be able to maintain beef production at anywhere near current levels, then, according to our analyses, a 30 % reduction in the intervention price is imperative. I have examined in detail the alternative proposal, which consists of restoring market balance solely by reducing production. I cannot endorse this proposal, because it cannot guarantee the future of the European beef industry. Nor can I, therefore, accept any amendments which – contrary to the Commission proposal – are aimed at lesser price reductions. We have to leave open the possibility of taking advantage of the positive market trends on the horizon. If we do not, then our competitors certainly will. As regards the level of direct aid, it is necessary – alongside the beef premium itself – also to take into consideration the other proposed changes to the common agricultural policy, and not least the impact we can expect these to have on the market. That is why I cannot accept amendments seeking to raise the beef premiums either.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is how to find a fair solution to the question of the form in which direct payments are made. In the EU, we have, broadly speaking, just two different systems of beef production: one is based primarily on cereals or silage maize, and the other is primarily grass‐based. I do not see any prospect of a solution, if we do not take sufficient account of both systems. Furthermore, as early as November 1996, the Agriculture Council committed itself to examining appropriate solutions for the particular situation of regions dependent on intensive stockfarming. On the other hand, I do also admit that the common agricultural policy needs to be more environmentally friendly. This is one of the key elements in the future success of the European model of agriculture. In view of these ground rules, and the diversity and complexity of the production systems used in the European beef and veal industry, the Commission believes that one solution might be to allow subsidiarity through national envelopes. It does seem, however, that this proposal is meeting with strong resistance here in Parliament – but not only here – and I shall therefore give further consideration to how this fact can be taken into account. Although I cannot accept the amendments today, for the reasons I have mentioned, I can assure you that the Commission will show an open mind if progress is made in the debates on the form which compensation should take, especially if it becomes apparent that this will also simplify matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Various other amendments seek to further tighten the criteria for granting extensification aid. Although I cannot formally accept the amendments concerned at this stage of the discussions, I should also like to point out that this issue needs to be examined further, and that I am favourably disposed towards improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the reform of the milk sector. I know that it will be particularly difficult to reach a consensus here, because opinions still differ widely. Let me start with the regulation on milk quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament supports the proposal to extend the arrangement for a further six years. As regards the situation after 2006, I agree that we should turn our attention to this well in advance of that date. In this context, Amendment No 45 seems to me to be quite acceptable. However, your proposals also include more extensive quota increases. You have to be clear on one point: every percentage point increase in quotas requires an 8 % reduction in price and an additional budget of around EUR 1 billion. On the other hand, I do not see the quota arrangement continuing, unless we accept a certain increase in quotas. In political terms, this means that if you want the quota arrangement to continue, you also have to accept market reform.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the allocation of additional quotas is concerned, we have based our proposal on priorities, set according to the support expressed by Parliament on various occasions. I cannot, therefore, endorse the amendments which upset the delicate balance we wish to achieve with the additional quotas. The proposal to apply sanctions when the reference quantities are exceeded, as a means of managing the market, may admittedly seem attractive at first sight, but in practice I see it causing us huge difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems we have, in particular in Germany, with so‐called ‘armchair milkers" are something we have to overcome, and we should do so without departing too far from the main principles of the quota arrangement. Nor should we disregard the possible legal consequences of some of the amendments and the demands for compensation which might ensue. For that reason, I cannot support the amendments along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards transfers of quotas, what we are trying to do in our proposal is to extend and improve the options Member States have under the law, without restricting their room for manoeuvre in this field. The wording therefore tries to preserve a balance between the call for subsidiarity, on the one hand, and maintaining the basic principles of the quota arrangement on the other. In my view, most of the amendments tend to disturb this balance. The wording is actually being revised in a number of areas at the moment, so that the aim of Amendment No 12 can, in any case, be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise once again that the current developments on the milk markets and our quota policy make me all the more determined to press on with the reform of this sector. I conclude, from discussions in various forums, that our proposals present a balanced and reasonable answer to the challenges facing the milk sector. I cannot, therefore, support the amendments advocating a greater or lesser degree of price reductions for milk as a starting‐point for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">On the direct payments to compensate for price reductions, discussions have focused on three problem areas. Firstly, the level of compensatory payments: here too, you should not look at the compensatory payments in isolation. The Agenda 2000 package does in fact contain several proposals which will be of benefit to milk producers, either because they result in a fall in costs, or because they result in increased output. Moreover, it is unlikely that the fall in institutional prices in the milk sector will be fully reflected in producer prices. That is why I cannot support the amendments which advocate increasing the compensatory payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the methods by which compensatory payments are made. By tying them to the milk quotas, we have tried to make the system both straightforward and fair. Unfortunately, the various alternatives discussed in the report do not meet these criteria. I thus find myself unable to comment on them here.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is related to the system of national envelopes. Our proposal tries to give the Member States scope to modulate the aid, so that they can take account of producers" different circumstances. At the same time, however, Member States are obliged to notify the Commission of their national provisions before they are enacted. This should provide a guarantee against distortions of competition. That is why I do not share the fears expressed in this regard. But it will certainly be necessary – once the final shape of the beef and veal production model is clear – to make sure that the compensatory payments in the milk sector fit in with this model.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment on the basic regulation: I do not believe that it is appropriate to include provisions in the basic regulation which are not directly related to the common organisation of the market in milk. I therefore propose to accommodate the provisions on animal welfare, and the aspects of milk production which concern structural policy, the environment and quality, where they each belong.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to arable crops. Developments so far have shown that, although the 1992 reform was a major step in the right direction, it did not go far enough. Continuing the present regime would mean either increased surpluses or set‐aside far in excess of the 17.5 %. Against that background, the reform is therefore necessary as a matter of urgency, I welcome all the changes which improve the Commission proposal, but not those which water it down.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, several amendments seek to lessen the proposed price reductions, or even to dispense with them altogether. I fear that a price reduction of less than 20 % would not allow us to achieve our objectives. A limited price reduction would result in increased use of export refunds, and our exports of cereals, pigmeat and poultrymeat would thus be restricted to the maximum quantities set by the WTO, while the volume of international trade increased.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards set‐aside, I am not ruling out the possibility that from time to time – because of unfavourable market conditions – certain areas of land will have to be taken out of production for a year. However, this should be the exception, because the market should be eased primarily by exports and not by compulsory set‐aside. Should it be necessary to fall back on set‐aside, then the Commission will make a proposal to the Council and Parliament to depart from the normal rate of 0 %. All amendments relating to this are therefore unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">A further bone of contention is the area direct payments. The changes you have proposed would simply perpetuate overcompensation, which came in for severe criticism, in particular from the Court of Auditors. We should not forget that, in the future, although market prices will be subject to greater fluctuations, they will, on average, be above the guaranteed price. Several amendments provide for additional payments for voluntary set‐aside, in order to promote renewable raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">I can certainly support any efforts to find new markets for agricultural products in industry. However, I doubt whether modulated set‐aside payments are the right answer to the problem. I must also point out that subsidies introduced on new crops will not be covered by the so‐called peace clause, and can easily be contested by the other WTO members. We should not, therefore, accept changes of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a different case for the numerous amendments directed towards retaining the existing regime for oilseeds or maize. This is not supporting new crops, but continuing or extending the existing regime. In the case of maize, I should, however, like to emphasise two points. First of all, evidence should be provided that special treatment for maize is still economically justified, when as it is, the Commission is proposing that a distinction should be drawn between irrigated and non‐irrigated crops. Moreover, singling out maize for special treatment would hugely complicate the aid system, and would further enhance the privileged treatment accorded to silage maize.</p>
<p class="contents">For oilseeds, it is true that keeping a specific premium would mean that the Blair House constraints would continue to apply, but in some cases, these are already – because of the massive sanctions – forcing the premiums actually paid out below the future target level. For all these reasons, I cannot accept changes which shake the foundations of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only comment on the main aspects of the changes here. I must also tell you, however, that the Commission cannot accept changes aimed at radically redistributing aid, or gearing Community instruments – such as, for example, the calculation of yields for the intervention system – to the national specifications of particular Member States, and to the detriment of other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to add a few words on the quality of cereals. Our produce must conform to the needs of the market and, in particular, to the requirements of importing countries, which means that we have to produce high‐quality cereals. This point is in part addressed in Amendment No 4. Although I cannot accept the form of wording chosen, I do share Parliament"s concerns in this regard. The Commission will therefore consider ways and means of improving quality as part of the application of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the last report, on horizontal rules for direct support schemes. The reform of the market organisations will mean that in the future most agricultural expenditure will be in the form of direct payments. It therefore seems reasonable to align these direct payments with the general aims of the common agricultural policy. That applies just as much to the social as to the environmental criteria. The proposed ceiling on direct payments should help the social balance. Should Member States wish to go further, they can introduce a system of modulation based on the number of employees. Making it compulsory to apply this rule Community‐wide would, however, cause serious problems, in particular with regard to carrying out checks and the definition of work units, which differs from Member State to Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the idea of extending capping or modulation to payments other than the direct payments within the market organisations, because payments made, say, under rural development, are pursuing specific goals and should be regarded, for example, as payment for work done to protect the environment, and not simply as income support. Given the great ecological variety and number of different farming structures in the Community, it would, realistically, be very difficult to lay down environmental conditions for the receipt of direct payments at Community level. The Member States should, however, be able to make direct payments conditional on compliance with environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the appropriations saved by capping payments, it was proposed to hand this money over to the Member States. Clearly, however, this would have corresponding consequences for the budget. Consideration should be given to whether there are not other options – in addition to the agri‐environmental schemes – for utilising the appropriations saved through modulation and cross‐compliance in ways which would not affect competition. Perhaps we could consider earmarking appropriations for the other accompanying measures, or for the compensatory supplement or the forestry measures. They should not simply be used for income support or structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, let me stress once more that the Commission is not in the business of pushing through the Agenda for its own sake, as it were. At the heart of the debate between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council is much more the fact that, for the Commission, the agricultural part of the Agenda will be its position for the WTO negotiations to be reopened at the end of the year, which will result in further liberalisation of the agricultural markets. Since everyone agrees that this will be the outcome, the Commission does not believe it can justify imposing several reforms on farmers shortly afterwards. This may indeed be more convenient and perhaps it also wins more approval in certain quarters, but European agriculture – like other sectors of the economy – needs stable basic conditions. The Agenda provides these, while also allowing European agriculture to have a share in the growth of the agriculture market. A slimmed‐down reform could do neither. That is why it does not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Associated with this, I admit, is the fact that, in particular for demographic reasons – half of European farmers are over 55 – we are not seeking to prevent inevitable structural change, but to accept it and to shape it in an appropriate way. I am therefore extremely grateful for the broad support which our proposals on rural development have found in this House. I can assure you that I am open to all practical alternative proposals which share our objectives, as I have already suggested here in connection with the beef and veal sector and step‐by‐step reductions.</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in this parliamentary trilogue – and I should like to start on a positive note – we agree on one point: CAP reform is inevitable and necessary, and it is not only up for discussion because of imminent eastward enlargement. This is an argument which, when advanced in various Member States, including my own, is always misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems caused by overproduction and the fact that the agricultural policy has hitherto lacked an ecological dimension – and this is something we Social Democrats explicitly recognise, Commissioner – have actually been tackled successfully in the past, and here too, some success can be discerned. Nevertheless, and we are all agreed on this, reform of the current agricultural policy, in the light of the many years of repeated and serious shortcomings – and this is once again our view – constitutes our primary duty to the people. The common agricultural policy does work, but recently it has in particular started to lean more towards the social side, meaning that there is a danger that a common agricultural policy and its attendant costs will meet with less and less acceptance from the European public, and the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">This increasing lack of acceptance on the part of the general public cannot, however, be written off as academic debate, and thus as not having any repercussions. An increasing number of jobs in rural areas will be at risk as a result of these difficulties, unless, in the interests of those concerned, an unvarnished and – if necessary – blunt analysis of the shortcomings is finally carried out. We have indeed come a long way together in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, some of your proposals are along the right lines, but these parts of the proposals are not, in our opinion, sufficiently thorough and remain basically symbolic. You are somewhat lacking in courage here to lead the way and to show your teeth for once, so as to improve the lot of weaker farmers in Europe. Some details are, we believe – and this also emerged from the contributions made here by our rapporteurs from the Group of the Party of European Socialists – in need of improvement: you made proposals in the milk sector, for example, which further undermine the position, in particular, of smaller and weaker farmers in less‐favoured areas and which – I must also add this – are a hotbed for yet more bureaucracy to rear its ugly head.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle Ages, being sentenced to be quartered was one of the most severe punishments there was. In bringing in the dairy cow premium, please do not reintroduce the quartering of premiums. We have actually moved on since then, and by the way: why not just go outside and try to explain this to a perfectly normal European – no one will understand a word, not to put too fine a point on it!</p>
<p class="contents">Detailed criticism in this House should not, however, result in total rejection of reform, which would only become necessary with eastward enlargement. We cannot accept that. We Social Democrats strongly urge all the Members of this Parliament to make an active contribution to this analysis, to help to provide alternatives which fulfil our responsibilities in the field of social and environment policy, and not to make themselves dependent on pressure groups which refuse reform of any kind. We have, unfortunately, had bad experiences in the various countries in this respect. I should also like to make the following point clear: anyone acting and arguing in this way – including through the media – robs the weaker, and often enough those who have lost out as a result of this agricultural policy, robs those very people of their hope for a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">For us as Social Democrats, it is intolerable that only one third of the annual agriculture budget reaches active agricultural employers. This state of affairs becomes nothing short of grotesque when 80 % of this aid is paid out to just 20 % of farmers, who are also the wealthiest ones. The President of the European Court of Auditors was quite right when he recently once again described this – basically, although he expressed it in diplomatic terms – as a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Social Democrats refuse to support a policy in the future which still gives the same entitlement to aid to the country millionaire – who, by massive rationalisation, has almost made his well‐situated holding into a one‐man business, and by having the best access to world markets secures the best prices – as to a farmer in a less‐favoured area, who often enough can only hold his own by going short himself. Let me just make one point clear: we do not envy this global player in the agriculture industry his economic success. But in our policy, which must be geared to social criteria, we take account of the fact that this role of global player is something which smaller and weaker farmers in many areas of Europe simply cannot assume.</p>
<p class="contents">European support policy, Mr President‐in‐Office – and I believe this to be one of the most important headlines to have emerged from recent discussions, including under the new presidency – European support policy in rural areas must, in critical aspects, become social policy. We must also make this clear to the lobby groups. Obviously, we also have to come up with an integrated policy for rural areas throughout Europe. We must not only safeguard existing jobs, we must also create new jobs in rural areas and also, by means of better infrastructure policy, ensure – and this is all part of it – that in a rural area it is possible to travel, on a daily basis, to a job outside agriculture, so that the rural community remains viable. If we translate this better approach – which is also perceptible in the Commission"s proposals on Agenda 2000 – into active policy, then I will have no further concerns about its being acceptable to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the points close to the heart of European Social Democrats is that we make the amount of aid distributed to agricultural holdings dependent on the number of long‐term jobs – on which social security contributions are payable – to be maintained and created in that holding, and of course this includes both employees and members of the family.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing unemployment is one of the main themes of the Council presidency; of course, this also affects rural areas and agriculture, and we want to work together against this severe employment crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Democrats in the European Parliament call this policy a policy for rural areas. This is an integrated policy. We have also had a wide‐ranging discussion in our group. We have had to reach compromises, and we are glad that we are also able to reach compromises of this kind in direct negotiations with the Council and the Commission. I can, however, tell you a secret – it is no secret really – the secret of the democratic Members of this House: in the future, we do not want these negotiations to lead simply to our making a contribution; as elected representatives of the European people, we also want to have the power of codecision in this final part of the European budget, because that is what we have been elected for, and we ask for your support in this respect too!</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gillis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report on beef. As rapporteur he tried to mellow the severity of the proposals in the beef sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The beef regime is the most complicated of all the regimes, mainly because it has the longest lead time. Beef farmers are still suffering from the aftermath of the BSE crisis in the UK, which has thrown the whole beef industry into a spiralling free fall, with consumption badly damaged. For example, pig and poultry meat consumption at 23 million tonnes is now more than three times higher than beef consumption at 7.1 million tonnes per year. This is only partly related to price. When imports of beef into the EU are added to domestic production, the total is almost one million tonnes higher than the internal market uptake. A major difficulty arises because of the constraints of the Blair House agreement on export volumes and the level of export refunds payable, together with the collapse of the Russian economy and the strategic downward price pressure which is applied by other third‐country markets as they take advantage of the Russian problem. On the one hand there are added pressures from the West, mainly from the US and the Cairns Group, as we prepare to start negotiations on the next WTO round and, on the other, there are pressures from the East to reduce the cost of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that beef farmers are shown the maximum consideration. The 10‐month and 22‐month premium for steers and the deseasonalisation premium must be kept in place. The proposed slaughter premium, while it is a contentious issue, is not a good replacement system. While it might be very simple to operate, it is not linked directly to land area and does not suit the highly desirable objectives of the Commission to promote environmentally friendly grass‐based systems of production – which the Commissioner has just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vitally important that the market be stabilised with the continued availability of intervention, whenever that is necessary and until such times as balance is restored to the market, and that imports and production be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say to the Commission that I understand what it is trying to do but, until the beef market has time to recover from the recent crisis, it is absolutely necessary to ease the very severe proposals so that farmers can stay in business. The Commission has a responsibility to find out why food prices to consumers are increasing steadily while farmers' product prices continue to fall heavily. Someone in the middle is profiteering. We need to stop this so that consumers can benefit from the price reductions to farmers. I know the Commissioner is aware of this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mulder </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, in the first instance I should say that despite all the interesting contributions we have had to this debate, the whole discussion of Agenda 2000 is somewhat unreal, because as Commissioner Fischler has rightly indicated, the changes in policy will mean that the policy costs more. I keep hearing everywhere that there is less money available. Is there really much point in talking about changes to agriculture policy when we do not know exactly what the future financial position is going be? It is high time Parliament was told. What funding is available for agriculture? I should like to know how Commissioner Fischler sees his proposals in relation to the availability of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Liberal Group in general is that the prospect of accession by the Eastern European countries makes it necessary to modify the agricultural policy. We are in favour of price cuts for the principal products. However, and above all because the world situation has changed significantly from two years ago, the general line is a smaller price cut than that envisaged by the Commission, together with full compensation for that reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We favour equal treatment for the most important products, and in specific terms that means equal treatment for the price of cereal starch and potato starch. We think that quotas have to remain, so we must have the milk quota, but also and above all a variable system of set‐aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word or two on cofinancing, largely for the benefit of the German minister who is here with us. The Liberal Group favours the cofinancing of income subsidies, not in order to improve the net payment position of certain countries, but primarily because this is unavoidable in the context of the accession of the Eastern European countries. If we had to pay income supplements as well, that would bankrupt the common agricultural policy and we do not want that. Yes to cofinancing, provided it can vary according to region, provided payment by the Member States is compulsory, and provided that Member States which do not do this are penalised by Brussels. But policy must continue to be set in Brussels, and there must be equal opportunities for competition throughout the European Union, with no distortion of policy by national rules. These, Madam President, are the broad lines of the Liberal Group"s position, and many speakers from my group will have points to add.</p>

<p class="contents">In addition, the famous and much‐discussed option of multi‐functionality will actually become a reality. Many farmers will have to work in other sectors in order to earn a living. It is interesting to see that the five reports were produced by Members who come from the rich areas of Europe and who naturally have shown evident impartiality for which I must congratulate them all.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a poor area and this is reflected in my views. I must also congratulate Mr Rehder for having made a left‐wing speech in this sitting, which is something I do not normally expect from the social democrats, while the Commission generally talks only of the market, using highly capitalist rhetoric. This is therefore somewhat of a change, hopefully in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cofinancing, I must say that this is clearly a problem for the poor countries. They will have difficulty in maintaining cohesion and in remaining within the concept of cohesion if the compulsory expenditure is not covered in full by the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As for milk and milk products, it is clear that a fairer allocation of quotas and the targeting of the more disadvantaged areas and young farmers is of the greatest importance to us. This would correspond to the European model of agriculture. With regard to cereals, we are clearly in agreement, but not on the amount by which the price of cereals must be lowered. However, we do agree, for example, that non‐food production must be encouraged so that we can continue to be farmers. We agree that the compulsory set‐aside should be maintained and in this I agree with the opinion of Mr Mulder who suggests a figure of between 0 % and 17 %. With regard to beef and veal, Mr Garot is an expert on the subject. We agree almost totally with his proposals and we naturally consider that the modulation is important. I also feel it is important to carefully note this modulation in the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. Just one thing needs to be decided: who is going to assess the modulation and who is going to judge the question of the work units on each holding?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jové Peres </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I will simply make a few general comments on Agenda 2000. I should like to acknowledge the work done by Parliament"s various rapporteurs. My group is always prepared to contribute right up until the last minute and I should point out that we believe that some of these reports are extremely valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, before beginning this debate, we must take two basic facts into consideration: firstly, the result of the votes in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development; and secondly, the debate on the Cunha report.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true to say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not managed to produce clear reports on the reforms of the common organisations of the market, we must take account of the fact that the Commission"s proposals have been rejected by a wide majority. The reasons for this situation are clearly outlined in the Cunha report and reflected in Parliament"s limited authority in agricultural matters. In my view, if this House had greater powers in agricultural issues, as should be the case, the Commission would not have been able to put forward the current proposals once the Cunha report had been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposals do nothing more than take the 1992 CAP reform one step further. Yet we are now unfortunately aware of the considerable consequences of that reform. Extremely high numbers of holdings are disappearing and agricultural jobs are being destroyed. In addition, the current imbalances caused by the fact that aid is allocated to farms in accordance with their size are becoming more marked, as are the imbalances between continental and Mediterranean production. As a result, these proposals would compound the social problems in rural areas. The Commission"s proposals on the fundamental question of limiting and modulating direct aid are tentative and insufficient. They do not rectify the imbalances between farmers, so they will not help us prevent farms from disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, with all due respect, it cannot be said that your proposal for modulation will protect social equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should have been aware of the problems in presenting proposals for Agenda 2000 when it drew up a package of proposals on rural development that attempted to convey the idea that it would compensate for the negative effects of reforming the common organisations of the market. The truth is that the proposals on rural development are insufficient, as Parliament has said. At times they are more destructive than constructive and the whole fundamental and innovative aspect of agri‐environmental aid, which my group supports, is partially distorted by financing regimes and proposals that, to some extent, conceal a partial renationalisation of the Community"s policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Having discussed the content, I should like to briefly mention the circumstances that gave rise to Agenda 2000. Although it is clear that it was an attempt to prepare for the enlargement of the European Union to include the CEECs, this aspect is only reflected in the dramatic reduction of the mechanisms for regulating the markets. However, there is no indication of how the CAP would apply to the new members, nor of how it would be financed after 2006. Therefore, Commissioner, what will happen after 2006? Will the dismantling of mechanisms regulating the market be taken even further? Will the common agricultural policy be renationalised once and for all? This all remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, my group believes that the proposals in Agenda 2000 are not so much related to enlarging the European Union but rather to developing negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">And if this is the case, Commissioner, we should like to know that recent legislative developments in the field of agriculture in the United States will not be ignored, and that the proposed mechanisms for decreasing protection for Community agriculture will not be taken too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make a brief comment on the financial aspects of Agenda 2000. Initially, the proposals proved wanting due to the Commission"s game of juggling the flow of euros. What is more, the effects of the crisis have not been sufficiently analysed and, in the agricultural guidelines, the margin needed to finance rural development will undoubtedly be reduced. In this respect, the Commission"s lack of political vision has given rise to the suggestion in the context of the report on own resources that direct aid be cofinanced. This is an abuse of the Commission"s powers, as well as a violation of Article 2 of the Treaty and of the principle of financial solidarity. It may also pave the way for the renationalisation of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you yourself have acknowledged that the debate on cofinancing should not have been held in the context of agricultural regulations, but in other forums. However, Commissioner, this severely distorted the debate we held in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I believe that the Commission has sent out clear signals with its messages.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to end by once again acknowledging the difficult task the various rapporteurs had, and to point out that my group believes that some of this work was extremely important.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graefe zu Baringdorf </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, our group believes that the approach being taken to reform is a step in the right direction. We think, however, that in many areas the action being taken is too half‐hearted. It is a question of abolishing public intervention, and not just of reforming it. A price reduction within the intervention regime is wrong; instead, we need to set a deadline for being able to dispense with intervention altogether. It is also wrong to cling to the instrument of export promotion; instead, we need to indicate when we will finish with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that both the policy of reducing prices and, in particular, the policy in the beef and veal sector, constitute a step towards abandoning intervention. In 2006, we – or however many of us are still around then – will discuss this, but a deadline should be given. The same applies to issues connected with the milk sector. We need to be told what will happen in 2006. Are we to expect quotas to be discontinued at that time? Holdings need to prepare for this. This also affects the question of quota trading, and the value of the quota. That concerns Germany in particular. This should be clarified. Of course, Mr Funke, that is also a request to the presidency. Holdings need to have security.</p>
<p class="contents">A further criticism is nothing new to you, Mr Fischler. We do not want old‐style alignment with the world market. We do not want a closed shop. We want doings and dealings, but please, if so, then we also want farmers to compete on quality. Anyone who wants to produce for the world market should go ahead and do so, and will then have to see that he adapts his trade to the other trading partners. The state must stay out of this. This should not be supported with public money.</p>
<p class="contents">Our next criticism is that you are still not concentrating enough on the internal market. After eastward enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, we will – after China – be the largest internal market in the world. Production should also be targeted at this market, and competition on quality should prevail. We want the market, and we want to make it possible for producers and farmers to gear themselves to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have to commend you – and our group has consistently supported this – for deciding to create a specific line for structures, appropriations for which will be diverted from the EAGGF Guarantee Section, albeit rather too cautiously. More should be done here! But the resistance to going down the road of quality‐based policy is huge. Perhaps your courage has deserted you. But we can of course still appeal to it. At the next round of reforms in 2006, it is to be hoped that the measures which are at present only accompanying measures will become the focus of agriculture policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to comment on the conduct being displayed here in Parliament. Until the elections in Germany, you had the German Government"s blocking tactics to deal with. Now we have the PPE Group"s blocking tactics to deal with. All the groups" coordinators on agriculture policy here had come to a unanimous agreement. We wanted to reach a compromise. We wanted to produce a line of argument, and this time we wanted to have a say in the reform; we wanted to use this procedure to postpone the vote, to bring our influence to bear, and also to strengthen your position vis‐à‐vis the Council in many other areas. Chaos was the only result. I hope that in the vote in the plenary it will still be possible to reach a sensible consensus, so that we achieve a majority and are, after all, able to continue to exert this influence.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you, Mr Funke – as President‐in‐Office and as the German Agriculture Minister – that if Mr Borchert had still been here, the PPE Group would have gone along with this, so that there was support and a demand from Brussels; Borchert could thus have claimed that Brussels had issued demands. Now they are going down the opposite path, so that people can say that the new Agriculture Minister is selling off agriculture and reducing prices. You should bear that in mind too. It is the opposition which is at work here, and the present opposition still has to learn to adopt a constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that at the Council negotiations a way will be found to move employment and the environment to the centre of agriculture policy, and that in 2006 we shall be able to set this agricultural policy back on its feet once and for all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barthet‐Mayer </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year Parliament adopted Mr Cunha"s report on CAP reform within the framework of Agenda 2000. The ARE Group, in its proposal for a federal and united European Union, contributed substantially to this report and fully endorsed the proposed European agriculture model.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of today"s debate we must enter into the spirit of the Cunha report and the measures adopted by Parliament, in particular regarding future CAP financing. The cost of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe requires a more ambitious reform and equitable budgetary revision. For the second year in a row, the average agricultural income per holding has fallen in the Union. What is more, after more than a year the Commission has still not responded to the political demands of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that although the 1992 reform led to a temporary improvement in markets, it did not remedy the main problems in the operation of the CAP. For the European Union to be able to cope with the challenges of enlargement and renewed negotiations within the WTO, the CAP needs to be thoroughly reformed so as to provide us with a viable system for the next ten years. Such reform must be jointly determined and controlled by Parliament. Simply proposing a unilateral reduction of the intervention prices of agricultural products does not in itself constitute a policy. Proposing to offset scheduled price reductions by giving farmers national direct aid that might quickly be called into question, would weaken agriculture, employment and the environment, and would once again increase public aid.</p>
<p class="contents">If there has been a consensus on one issue, that issue is the need for CAP reform. What is more, the Commission"s motivation to carry out such a reform might indeed be questioned. It doubtless needs amending, but with what aim in mind? The Commission, while claiming to uphold CAP principles, is in fact gearing its reform towards scrapping Community preference in favour of prior acceptance of a new opening to third‐country imports, to the detriment of a thorough reform for the benefit of the Community. This would lead, among other things, to an increased reduction in the number of holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, what new approaches can be taken in relation to these five reports, none of which was fully adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because of national disagreements, despite efforts by my fellow rapporteurs who should be congratulated for their work and tenacity. In my opinion Mr Mulder"s report is an improvement on the Commission"s text, particularly as regards agri‐environmental measures and technical management measures, but the problem of cofinancing remains to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf"s report and the fact that the European Commission"s proposal was adopted unamended, I intend, in the spirit of the report, to endorse those amendments aimed at improving provisions relating to aid ceilings, for example on the basis of measures relating to employment and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Garot"s report, which I fully endorse, the compromise currently under discussion calling for a limited slaughter premium per animal category should be fully endorsed by the committee. What is more, I shall support the rapporteur"s call to restore balance to cattle farmers" low incomes in relation to other categories of farmers who receive more support.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of milk, which is the only COM that was not amended in 1992, a delicate balance has been created by introducing quotas. This must be preserved by resisting overproduction and inflationary tendencies. Like the rapporteur, I am in favour of balanced development in all regions and of equal income. Additional quotas that do not distort the market must be granted firstly to young farmers and less‐favoured areas such as mountainous regions by increasing aid for processing high‐quality milk products.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must support Mr Fantuzzi"s position regarding more selective intervention in quality standards and the implementation of minimum import standards. We cannot endorse a single rule for cereals and high‐protein oleaginous crops when the European Union continues to suffer a shortage of proteins for animal food. The Commission"s refusal to propose a specific regulation for high‐protein oleaginous crops does not bode at all well for future WTO negotiations. As regards set‐aside, the base rate must remain low and continue to allow production to be controlled. By the same token, voluntary set‐aside for environmental reasons or non‐food purposes must be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, once again on behalf of the ARE Group, I call on the Commission to set this necessary and urgent CAP reform in motion by redistributing aid in a way which resolutely favours the rural economy, the environment and product quality, for the benefit of farmers, consumers and European taxpayers. For many reasons, of which you will all be aware, the CAP in its present form is neither sustainable or permanent. It is the Commission"s duty to bring CAP reform closer to Community preference by basing its bilateral agreements on equitable trade rules that are aimed at maintaining jobs in agriculture and a balanced number of holdings in line with the notion of rural development adopted by Parliament. By moving away from the traditional policy of support through price control, the CAP is not aimed at sustainable and humanist agriculture. Any future CAP must respect the right of Europeans to control their agriculture and their food. This is the price the European Union will have to pay if it wants to be a leading player in globalisation. Once again, to conclude I would say that it is not more or less aid that is needed, but better aid!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nicholson </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – Madam President, I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their hard work and diligence in preparing the reports. Unfortunately the committee did not reward them as it should have done when they brought their reports to committee. We are now embarking on a further reform of the common agricultural policy under Agenda 2000. There is no doubt that when we are finished it will cost more and will become more difficult to defend. We have to strive to find a balance between the producer on one hand and the consumer on the other because the taxpayer is becoming less inclined to support the rural community.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole of agriculture across the European Union is facing a very difficult time financially. Returns to the farmers are reducing year on year in spite of major support going into the industry. We are in agreement with that support. We have to ensure that the industry survives because the family farm is the backbone of the European Union. We must ensure that young farmers will come into the industry, that their status within that industry will be a good one and that it will be an industry they want to be part of.</p>
<p class="contents">Milk is an important part of the industry. Many farmers throughout Europe depend on it and we must ensure that we get a policy that is balanced and correct. Milk quotas in principle should remain but should be changed in line with the suckler cow and sheep quotas. In my area farmers who do not get out of their beds in the morning to milk cows can lease their quota and make more profit than the farmer who does and who has to pay money to lease the quota through another farmer. There must be something wrong with a system that produces a situation like that. It must be reformed and brought in line with other quota systems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to beef, in my area the industry has been totally shattered and something needs to be done to restore it. I do not think private storage would be enough and we need to consider keeping the whole area of intervention. I am against paying premiums on heifers and bulls and that is something the Commission should look at. I do not think it will be a help because no extra money is available.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with the Commissioner when he speaks of the national envelope. This will thoroughly change the common agricultural policy. The national envelope will mean inequality between the nation states. It means farmers in one area will have advantages over farmers in other areas. We should not go down that road. I would ask the Commissioner to take on board one other point. If we are going to tie the hands of the producers as to how they produce food, we should not import food from non‐EU countries which is not produced to the same high standards. Do not tie farmers' hands any more. Give them fair and equal competition with the rest of the world. Make sure that imports into the Union are of the same standards as the food we produce.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span> Madam President, Commissioner, the debate on the agricultural facet of Agenda 2000 and its 8 regulations would appear to provide us with a solid legislative structure and a whole range of attractive new elements. It therefore seems strange for us to be talking about the national envelope, sustainable or global development, cofinancing, multifunctionality, eco‐conditionality, subsidiarity, high quality and the challenges to be met when, in fact, everything can be summed up in just one word: continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is a new CAP reform, an overhaul of the 1992 reform. Nothing has changed: price reductions – 15, 20, 30 % – the Malthusian set‐aside, rationing and austerity. The situation is even worse than in 1992 because not everyone will receive compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that you have at least achieved something new tactically speaking in that you have succeeded in dividing the Committee on Agriculture. Proof of this lies in its rejection of the five reports. Northern Europe, Britain, Germany, ultra‐liberal Europe and the Europe of accountants have applied pressure which has led to submission, then despoliation and lastly, illusion. Pressure, submission, despoliation, illusion: this is the downward spiral in which European farmers are trapped.</p>
<p class="contents">The first stage is pressure, which has three sources. Firstly, there is budgetary pressure from Germany, which is keen to reduce its contribution; I can understand this and, what is more, the French might be working along similar lines; secondly, there is pressure from the cohesion countries, namely Spain, Portugal and Ireland, who all want to retain their share of the Structural Funds; thirdly, there is pressure due to enlargement to the East, which will require additional Structural Funds. Enlargement is adding pressure precisely because it dictates agricultural price reduction to the extent that once the ten Eastern countries have arrived, EAGGF expenditure and guaranteed prices will not increase. Lastly, pressure is being exerted by the WTO 2000 negotiations, given that Agenda 2000 is the progeny of WTO 2000. This will lead to reductions in land aid and export aid and, as a consequence, will result in submission once again to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This submission is twofold: in the first place there is submission to Germany. It is Germany that is pushing for cofinancing to reduce European agricultural credits and evidently to increase the Structural Funds for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are of strategic interest to Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is submission to the United States, as in 1992, something which appears to be genetic in the case of the European Commission. Even before negotiations got under way, it began by aligning itself with the United States and not once did it call on them to engage in fair trade which would take into account animal welfare, environmental protection, social protection for farmers and food quality. No, instead it aligned itself with the United States! And this occurred despite the fact that the United States, exceptionally, is not hesitating to release 6 billion dollars of aid for farmers when they advised us to stop giving out aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is that instead of taking the offensive we give in to them. A perfect example of this is the symbolic banana dossier. Section 301 applies, or is threatened to apply, and we, moreover, do not even possess the same legislative arsenal. A fitting expression to sum this up might be: when the going is good we give in, when the going is bad we still give in!</p>
<p class="contents">The consequence of this is the despoliation of farmers, which is my third point. By way of example, under the Guarantee section of the EAGGF, ECU 500 million are to be redirected to cover pre‐accession funds. In other words, farmers in the West will suffer in order to finance the accession of farmers from the East. The last to arrive will be the first to receive financial aid. This is undoubtedly a very Christian way of going about things: the worker who arrives at the eleventh hour earns more than the people who arrived before him.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the financial resources under the Guarantee section of the EAGGF will be used to finance restructuring and the fishing fleets which until now have been financed by the FIFG. This means that in order to help the victims of the fisheries policy, those who have suffered under the agricultural policy are forced to endure further hardship. This is the unfortunate illusion the reform has created.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are told that the aim of the reform is to achieve the European agriculture model as developed by Arlindo Cunha. Indeed, we all agree with the family‐run farms, food safety, environmental protection and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, in reality you are rigorously ensuring that the opposite of this occurs. If the reduction in agricultural prices is not fully compensated the outcome is a fall in agricultural incomes, which forces the farmer to look for other forms of compensation to keep his head above water. And where does he find such alternative sources? In the race for overproductivity.</p>
<p class="contents">This in fact means that farming will grow to the detriment of young farmers, family‐run farms, country populations and the survival of the European model. Costs will be reduced through the use of growth activators, cheap inputs and urban sludge, for example by using antibiotics, which results in a drop in quality, safety and environmental protection. And lastly, it will lead to increased depopulation, desertification and insecurity, and a reduction in quality and food independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I grant you that if this scenario comes true you will have achieved the <span class="italic">tour de force</span> of turning the clock back to the 1960s where we counted for next to nothing on the world market. So in this context, that of an agricultural Euro‐Disney, you will not play the part of Mickey as that part is played by Mr Kantor. Neither will you play Uncle Scrooge as Germany plays that part. You will not be the director as Walt Disney is American. All that is left to play is the part of Pluto, the dog that keeps guard over American interests. But at least the character of Pluto is as nice as Sissi, which will mean that Austria will get out while the going is good. All the same, it is a shame that you are forgetting and abandoning the great agricultural operas in favour of little operettas.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colino Salamanca </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, today we are debating the proposals for reform of the various agricultural sectors without knowing the possible financial impact of such proposals and, above all, whether or not they fit in with the future financial perspective. This prevents us from being able to realistically address the fundamental question of how to finance such proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Commission has come up with some optimistic hypotheses, according to which there will not be any problems. However, as the Court of Auditors itself has established, the truth may be somewhat different. In particular, the Court of Auditors draws our attention to the question of whether or not we will be able to manage an agricultural policy where the new Member States, which will join from 2003 onwards, will not receive direct support. Could we maintain such a course over time without tensions arising?</p>
<p class="contents">The second general comment is that, although the Commission wishes to increase the competitiveness of European agriculture, it is essentially doing so through pricing instruments and by reducing guaranteed prices. But this new direction lacks the necessary extra element as the Commission has not set up programmes promoting the high level of quality in European production.</p>
<p class="contents">Having established these premises, I should like to say that the path chosen by the Commission would seem to be the right one, in view of international growth forecasts, the increased competitiveness of European agriculture, the opening up to new Members and the future WTO negotiations. But this should be an opportunity for using these proposals to correct any anomalies which still remain from the past. For example, in the cereals sector, it would appear to be too optimistic to establish a zero rating for the compulsory set‐aside of land. There are some forecasts which say that we will still possibly need to reintroduce export refunds and will certainly to reintroduce legally binding measures. Also, the possibility of adjusting the reference periods for regionalisation plans in some Member States should be raised, and even the idea of setting different production levels for maize in comparison to other cereals. Moreover, it does not seem necessary to use surface area to even out aid for oilseed in relation to aid for other cereals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards dairy produce, whilst the price guidelines are acceptable, there is no real justification for providing support according to the ‘virtual cow" system. Prices drop in the same way for all livestock farmers and it is ridiculous that the way support is allocated benefits precisely those who are most competitive and, in contrast, penalises those who are working to make their farms become competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">A similar situation applies in the meat sector. Reform should not further penalise those Member States who have less premium units – whether these be for suckler cows or male bovines – and these reforms are on top of the age limits established for obtaining premiums for sheep.</p>
<p class="contents">The system that allows the Member States to distribute some support according to national guidelines also seems to us to be raising more problems than it solves. And, as the Court of Auditors itself pointed out, the need to respect a minimum Community framework is still a vague provision in the proposals. The proposed decentralisation could cause problems when it comes to precisely determining which costs can be subsidised with Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the horizontal regulation, although we are delighted that it tries to correct some imbalances within the CAP, we do however regret the fact that there is a danger that this will be unworkable. Defining the environmental obligations to be fulfilled must remain in the hands of Community authorities. The same applies to setting the overall ceilings for receiving aid where permanent employment can and must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite their tentative nature, we support the Commission"s proposals, not so much for the savings that these proposals could make but more because we believe the indiscriminate granting of subsidies is unjustifiable. And as the Commission"s own information shows, we must remember that only 0.2 % of farmers receive aid worth over ECU 100 000. We believe that the Commission"s small effort outlined in these proposals should not be subject to so much criticism from the right.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr Funke, we are almost namesakes! The Fantuzzi report, on which I should like to say a few words, has indeed received a great deal of attention – at any rate, 93 amendments have been tabled by the groups, all of which are, of course, justified to a greater or lesser extent. Mr Fantuzzi has done a good job – I have to grant him that – and he also always wears the nicest ties in Parliament, because they are made in Italy. But he has advocated a 20 % reduction in prices, which I oppose, and I shall tell you why: 20 % is far too much for farmers to withstand. We can only just, with gritted teeth, withstand a 10 % reduction, above all because only 50 % of this will be compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">In my region in Baden‐Württemberg, there are not any of these holdings which Mr Rehder always claims are receiving millions. Perhaps he should show them to me. Not in my region in any case, where the situation is quite the opposite; farmers have a hard time of it there, and it would be nothing short of insulting to reproach them constantly for being some of the rich ones.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to be competitive on the world market, Mr Funke, then we also need to know whether farmers are able to withstand this. I wonder, however, with whom we are supposed to compete. With countries where wages are only 10 % of ours? Where the environment is being damaged? I reject conditions of competition of this kind. That is also why we must reject price reductions of 20 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Price reductions alone are not the right way to help agriculture in the long term; instead, we need more intelligent solutions, if we want to hold on to our farmers. In practice, therefore, we also need to promote oil plants and protein crops – I fully agree with Mr Fantuzzi there – and we need to promote energy and industrial crops. There is a shortage of these crops on the markets, and we need better support for them so that industry, and the processing plants we have now set up, can also source these products in the future. If we promote these crops, they will enrich ecological diversity, while at the same time this would have the advantage of our not concentrating solely on cereals, cereals which we cannot sell as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">By constantly reducing prices, we should not turn our agricultural producers into whipping boys – it only serves to depress farmers. After all, there is 1.5 pfennigs" worth of wheat in a bread roll, and a bread roll costs 70 pfennigs. After the reform it will probably cost 80 pfennigs, despite the Commissioner"s reducing the price of wheat by 20 %. I cannot explain that to anyone, Mr Fischler. Can you? Please let me have the recipe, and then I can go to the people and say that this is as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Two thirds of EU governments are led by Social Democrats, and they are unable to accept Mr Rehder"s proposals. Why then, Mr Funke, are the two thirds not saying: Mr Rehder is right, we will adopt this agricultural policy? I would take advantage of his claim that 20 % of farmers receive 80 % of the aid, but I am not even sure if he really knows what he is talking about. In the future I should like information which is a little more specific, because that is a sound bite which is doing the rounds and which disavows agriculture ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">... perhaps in many other regions too: I have also seen holdings of this kind in Andalusia, Mr Colino. It does not irritate us when the information is specific, but it should be specific, and not delivered as a sound bite; otherwise we will also have to investigate in Lower Saxony, to see whether all is well there, that is quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject sound bites, Mr Funke – I agree with you there – and instead we should call a spade a spade. Help us out of our plight, and afterwards I will shake your hand again, because having the name Funke is not such a bad thing after all, is it?</p>

The realisation of this expression of political will is the responsibility of the Council of Ministers, for which Parliament drafts an opinion. Agricultural conditions vary widely in the Union. In the south it is too hot and dry, while in the north it is the opposite: too little warmth, which reduces crop yield and raises building and heating costs. The Union"s permanent adverse natural conditions, both in the southern and northern regions, must definitely be taken into consideration when decisions are being made.</p>
<p class="contents">Maize does not grow in all Member States. Aid for the storage of maize should therefore extend to silage for those producers of milk and beef who cannot farm maize because of the prevailing natural conditions. Otherwise aid for maize will distort competition in the single market. Parliament has already approved aid for silage in Mr Cunha"s report. In northern regions crop farming needs increased subsidies owing to local conditions. Grain too has to be dried.</p>
<p class="contents">The harsh experience of the war has taught the nations of Europe the vital importance of their own food production. In Finland, the Union"s northernmost Member State, food production is possible thanks to the Gulf Stream. The reductions in producer prices in Agenda 2000 are too great for producers in the EU"s most problematic regions, as farmers there will not even be able to recover their production costs at current market prices. This would lead to virtual farming.</p>
<p class="contents">The crises of the global economy in Asia, Russia and South America have forced world market food prices down. The USA also had to grant aid to its producers to the tune of USD 8 billion, so that farmers would not go bankrupt. For that reason the proposed reductions in producer prices in Agenda 2000 should be halved and farmers should be fully compensated for those reductions, so as not to put too great a squeeze on European producers. The changes in the global economy have to be taken seriously, and we should not be making it difficult for farmers to cope in the face of major challenges. I have a question for the President‐in‐Office: how do you intend to make sure that the considerable producer price reductions in Agenda 2000 do not lead to a wave of bankruptcies in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind everyone that food is a lot more than just a product with a price on it. It is European culture at its best and high quality food always has its own price.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, the common agricultural policy was to remain central to the medium‐ and long‐term planning of European agriculture. Despite its limitations it has stood the test of time. But having said that, we must also provide for the unpredictable.</p>
<p class="contents">The present difficulties experienced by farmers are serious. They are not the result of the 1992 reform but due to unpredictable circumstances which include BSE, the collapse of the Russian economy and, in some cases, the renationalisation of food markets. In my view we are not responding to these short‐term difficulties. Many farmers may not survive to benefit from the long‐term measures of the proposed reform which is the subject of Agenda 2000 and this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to look seriously and urgently at these more immediate problems. Whatever the cost, it is not in the interests of the European Union that the family farms which are central to the European agricultural model are fast becoming marginalised. We have a duty to respond to their plight. In my view they are not crying ‘wolf". Perhaps their difficulties serve the hidden agenda of some who do not have to courage to say openly that family farms do not have a future in the Europe of a new millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose today that some financial reserve be provided within the agricultural budget to address such emergency eventualities when they occur. With improving job opportunities outside agriculture I am worried about the continuity of family farming. I feel young people will not take up farming as a profession. If we ignore this fact we are burying our heads in the sand. Down the road this Parliament will find itself having to address the serious problem of the human resources of agriculture necessary for the continuity of the agricultural sector.</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, although the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly rejected the Commission"s proposals, it has been unable to come up with any coherent alternatives in spite of the quality of the reports presented. There are at least three reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the lack of precision and the weakness of the Commission"s projections. Today it appears clear that these projections were seriously affected by the financial crisis, the underestimation of the actual cost of the reform and prior acceptance of American demands in renegotiating the WTO agreements. The second reason for this impasse is the financial constraints imposed by the Stability Pact with the introduction of the euro. The third and most fundamental reason is the decision to base this reform on the need for capital returns through a reduction in agricultural prices, and not on the needs of producers, consumers or society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can firstly be reproached for having retreated into the triple across‐the‐board logic of reducing prices, dismantling market management instruments and reducing European financial intervention. It can also be reproached for wanting to impose all its ideas despite their unpopularity. In this way, following the Vienna Summit, President Santer labelled the positions adopted by Heads of State and Government as being ‘purely tactical" and went on to state that the final agreement would be based on the Commission"s proposals. To think in these terms amounts to a blatant refusal to acknowledge the widening gap between the aspirations of farmers and citizens of the Union for more jobs, higher incomes and a better quality of life, and the Commission"s ultra‐liberal ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">If those countries who are experiencing the gradual exodus of agricultural workers, the growing imbalance between producers, produce and land, and the uncertainties surrounding food safety, had the opportunity – as we will tomorrow – to censure such a policy, they would do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is incumbent on both Parliament and the Council to develop an alternative policy. We have the means to do so. Twice Parliament has called for a new approach to the CAP, an approach based on employment, balanced land use, the Community preference and a rejection of cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the Committee on Agriculture"s vote on the various reports has revealed an overall desire to reject alignment with world prices, to protect agricultural incomes, to pay for all the social benefits agriculture offers in terms of employment, land development and the environment, to limit and modulate public aid by distributing it more fairly and to maintain producers" organisations and market management instruments by improving them.</p>
<p class="contents">This constructive and alternative approach can once again be demonstrated either in preparation for Parliament"s vote on 28 January or by referring the reports back to committee, which would give the Commission a strong hint that it needs to formulate other proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Council, the presidency yesterday and today reaffirmed its good intentions to develop a more competitive and ecological form of agriculture, protect farmers" interests and advance a more effective employment policy. However, by enclosing all of these proposals in the straitjacket of budgetary austerity and reduced agricultural expenditure, would the Council be able to resolve current contradictions in European integration? Might it not worsen the economic and social recession that threatens us at present, given that the solution would appear to lie in increasing the Union"s financial resources from the profits generated by financial activity? This would appear all the more essential as agriculture and food production are faced with the human and global challenges of the next millennia.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament focused its report on the need to respond to the challenges facing humanity in terms of food, energy, the environment, water supply and sustainable development. The decisions this House will make on 28 January must remain faithful to these aims.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hudghton </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Madam President, the Agenda 2000 package of reforms provides a major challenge to Europe's decision‐makers and I do not underestimate that in any way. The need to achieve an early agreement on the package must be balanced with the importance of ensuring that a fair and a reasonable set of proposals is seen to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy clearly must be examined and adjusted in an attempt to strike a balance between on the one hand providing proper support to our food production industry, and on the other hand ensuring that good value is achieved for the expenditure of public funds. Adequate and transparent systems must of course be in place to ensure that financial controls meet the high standards that we are entitled to expect.</p>
<p class="contents">The diversity of circumstances across the European Union in the agricultural sectors clearly requires due consideration in the new common agricultural policy, which must be tailored to properly fulfil its purpose. My home area of Europe – the north‐east of Scotland – is sometimes called the larder of Scotland, containing as it does some of the best examples of high‐quality agricultural, and indeed fisheries, production in Europe. Aberdeen Angus beef, cereals, oilseed, sheep, poultry, soft fruit and potatoes, to name but a few, are all produced in an industry which is economically crucial to Scotland, with an output of £2 billion and one in ten of all Scottish jobs being dependent on it, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our farmers are all aware and accept that common agricultural policy reform is needed, but the nature of the final report proposals should reflect the needs of the industry in Scotland, for example, in the definition of farm unit size. Scotland, politically, is in a disadvantaged position at this moment, with our national interests being represented from London. I hope that, as the reform package is finalised, the UK Government will, this time, properly articulate the case of Scotland's agricultural industry and that the Commissioner will take due note of any direct representations received from Scotland.</p>
<p class="contents">Our farmers, as well as our consumers and our taxpayers, are entitled to expect that reforms will bring about a genuine improvement in any new package and that specific changes, once agreed, can be carefully phased in so that our farmers can adjust to further changes in a properly managed way. The farmers that I know are hardworking people, many in small family businesses who are aware of, and accept fully, their responsibilities to the consumer, to the environment and to the rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, let us work towards a common agricultural policy which will encourage, not further discourage, their efforts to continue to survive.</p>

For more than a year these problems have been hidden to a certain extent, both by the Commission and by a great many professional agricultural associations who at the time had not fully comprehended the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the problems are building up, from the partial disappearance of the green ECU to the fall in both farmers" incomes and the number of farmers – it must be added, contrary to the objectives of land‐use planning – and so on. So, in order to solve this financial equation we no longer talk only in terms of reduced prices for agricultural products, with of course the promise of full or partial compensation through aid that will inevitably be called into question within the framework of future WTO negotiations. Given that this will not be enough to help budgetary balance, the needs of enlargement and many other problems, some are advocating CAP cofinancing. This would mean an artificial increase in the European budget which would be entirely inconsistent with the Edinburgh agreements and the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Fantuzzi mentioned earlier, all of this seems worthy of a motion of censure even if a good financing plan that was clear, precise and took into account the development of expenditure at current or constant prices had been able to clarify our debates and prevent all the rapporteur"s proposals from unfortunately receiving such a pounding. The CAP, I should like to stress, is the only genuine common policy we have and I was surprised to note today that the defenders of a federal Europe are prepared to sacrifice it in favour of other interests.</p>
<p class="contents">No one would deny that the CAP in its present form is in need of reform, Commissioner, which goes to show that the original version was no good or at least was not sufficiently well adjusted to agricultural development and the needs of society. We have had the problem of BSE to contend with and very shortly the GMO problem will lead to understandable consumer concerns over food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">If there was one reform needed it would evidently be needed in this area, but the Commission"s proposals – your proposals, Commissioner – for price reductions force farmers to seek compensation for this steady fall in their income through ever more intensive production methods by enlarging their buildings, finding ways to reduce their input costs and by intensifying production to the detriment of environmental issues. For some this will mean fertilisation using urban sludge with all the risks associated with it. For others it will mean using growth activators and using less costly animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, when these proposals for CAP reform are discussed with other proposals on animal welfare and the responsibilities of farmers who produce agricultural foodstuffs, we note that European farmers are caught up in a downward spiral, the inevitable consequence of which will be to speed up rural depopulation. Is this really your aim? Is this really our aim? I do not think so, but the action we are taking is unfortunately leading us in this direction.</p>

Regrettably, these principles are increasingly being called into question. In particular, the principle of Community preference is under attack from the large multinational food companies, which see it as standing in the way of their attempts basically to destroy Europe's small farms.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as financial solidarity is concerned, the Member States' main concern seems to be to assess the costs and benefits arising for each of them from the implementation of the CAP. We are aware that resources must be earmarked under the Community budget to finance employment and infrastructure measures but, in our view, if agriculture is sacrificed to this end, Europe will be taking a step backwards in a sector which is crucial to international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to know what guarantees are to be given for the future of farmers in Padania and Europe, so as to protect their incomes and their technical and human resources.</p>

It remains to be seen what you will make of it, Commissioner, at a time when the Commission is being particularly criticised. In my opinion, the best proof of our will and ability to work towards improving human society in Europe and throughout the world would involve shrewdly deciding our future and making social choices. But we need to have the means to be able to do this, and instead of limiting ourselves in budgetary terms and thus restricting our political activities in a way that is unsatisfactory, we need to ensure that we have sufficient financial resources to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning, the common agricultural policy was the motor behind the creation of what was first the common market and then the European Community and now the European Union, pending the advent of the European State. We are in a state of political penury. European decision‐makers are all too often in the pay of the United States which has forced its ideas, its operation and production methods on us to the detriment particularly of European farmers – 40 million jobs in agriculture have been lost since 1960 – and the cultural dimension of European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, having imposed their antisocial rules on us by means of the GATT, now want to impose their hormones on us until such a time when they can unleash their unfettered genetic engineering in Europe. These practices, which mean a couple of extra dollars in the pockets of genetic engineers but rarely boost farmers" incomes, undermine consumer confidence in the food products that we place at their disposal. There is a huge distance between the debate on quality and the measures actually taken to implement this quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary phobia, added to the bad handling of what has been termed the mad cow crisis, has considerably undermined my confidence in the Commission, in its ability to shrewdly predict the future – and not only the future of European farmers – and its overall approach to what is generically referred to as rural society, its role and its future, without forgetting the Community preference provided for in the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are being asked, as we indeed are, to reorganise European agriculture through Agenda 2000 with farmers of whom over 60 % are over 50 years old. And, as you mentioned earlier, as much as possible will be achieved with these people, but there appears no desire to take measures to make the farming profession and that of rural and environmental manager more attractive to young people. Nothing specific has been proposed, not even a credible 20‐year draft outlining what will be done for farmers about to retire or for the young people who might begin their careers.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest you do a little test, Commissioner, if you have enough time, among the people in your office to see what conditions would be necessary to entice civil servants away from their jobs to take over or start a farm somewhere in either Northern or Southern Europe. I am sure that if we were to create conditions based on the answers given we would see young people flocking to work in farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 also requires us to provide for enlargement to include countries of the East. I should like to say straight away that I am in favour of this enlargement taking place. But if it is stated that there will be no increase in the budget and that the same envelope will be kept for agriculture and for the Structural Funds, this will essentially boil down to Southern Europe paying for enlargement to the East. In other words it is the poor in the South who will be paying for their poor Eastern counterparts. This situation is unacceptable, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by reminding you that our common enemy, politically speaking of course, is the Council. Commissioner, in your position regarding the resolutions adopted by Parliament, you will need to remember this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Böge </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President‐in‐Office, for us the Agenda is a package. At the outset, I will say quite deliberately that in the end, it is the results which will count and not only whether we keep to the timetable. For me, the Commission"s proposals on agriculture go too far. I think that the votes in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have made it clear that there will be no majority in this House in favour of the Commission proposals, as they currently stand.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, if we look at America, we find that two years after the farm bill came into force, discussions on parts of it have already been reopened. Let us not make the strategic mistake of already wanting, as it were, to negotiate away some of the negotiating points which we need for the forthcoming WTO round. I tell you quite clearly, Commissioner Fischler, that anyone who works in this way has never worked with cattle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, perhaps we should issue a joint statement to the German and European public, saying: we do not have any problem, in terms of both sides making the necessary adjustments, with fully integrating the agricultural economies of the applicant countries by 2004, provided that the basic freedoms of the internal market – free movement of people, capital, services and goods – are established at the same time. There could then at long last be a fair debate in this House about the other difficulties and stumbling‐blocks connected with the agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the financial side, I should like to say that obviously the issue of fair contributions and a balanced budget in terms of both income and expenditure forms part of the Agenda debate. The question of cofinancing also belongs in this negotiating package. As you know, Parliament will be giving its definitive opinion on this in February. I must of course also confess, Mr President‐in‐Office, that the reason why the question of cofinancing is so controversial with German farmers and the subject of such contentious debate is that they might see themselves being faced with considerable problems – in view of the transposition of the accompanying measures and the reluctance of several <span class="italic">Länder</span> to cofinance them – if we were to choose this approach. As you know, even Lower Saxony was not exactly at the top of the list for transposing the accompanying measures in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">These days, of course, everyone has their experts. Commissioner Fischler, I should like to say very clearly that the experts recently drafted in by the Commission, whom you specifically referred to as testifying for the Commission proposals, produced reports which are based on very foolhardy theories. This is because if you are going to say that price reductions will benefit consumers, that unions and employers will take account of these price reductions and that this will affect prices accordingly, then the price of pigmeat in recent months ought to have been substantially lower.</p>
<p class="contents">When, during this presidency, we are debating and arguing about employment policy, we should not forget that these experts are assuming that there will be a substantial decline in the number of those employed in agriculture, if these proposals go through as they stand. That is another reason why they need to be fundamentally amended.</p>

The question is whether we can agree on a reform which has the right balance, so that the agricultural sector does not end up carrying the heaviest load, and so that the burden in connection with the reform which will take place because of enlargement and the WTO negotiations is evenly distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few comments to make. The first concerns the Fantuzzi report on cereals. I think the reduction in the price of cereals proposed by the Commission is too great, because inadequate compensation is being provided. I would like to bring the attention of both the President‐in‐Office and the Commissioner to the fact that cereals are the most important element in controlling agricultural production. If the price of cereals is low, this will result in over‐production of animal products in the form of beef and veal, pigmeat, eggs and poultry, because the farmers will want to have compensation and everyone will exploit the low price of cereals. I therefore think the price of cereals is set too low and the Commission is not sufficiently interested in using set‐aside. The set‐aside scheme is the best tool for regulating the production of cereals. The USA has shown this for many years. If the production of cereals is too high, land is put into storage. That is cheaper than putting cereals into storage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, a comment on the calculation showing that EUR 3‐4 billion is being saved on the budget and that consumers are saving EUR 10‐15 billion. This means that agriculture will transfer EUR 15 billion to consumers and agriculture will lose out in the reform, because compensation will not be available through the market, and that is no solution for supplying the market with agricultural produce. I think there is a long way to go before we can reach agreement on agricultural reform, but I hope we can succeed. I agree that it should happen before March, and we will do our best.</p>

At the Vienna European Council in December a number of disagreements remained and some Member States wanted to reduce their contribution to the Union budget. This seriously called into question the financial solidarity between Member States and overall European unity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you and, moreover, stress that agriculture is the only sector to have a common policy on which European integration has hinged for the past four decades. In Agenda 2000 the Commission proposed a reduction in support prices, an increase in direct aid to producers, cofinancing by Member States, and so on, but it remained frustratingly silent about the increase in the production of agricultural products for non‐food purposes, which is something I regret deeply.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain absolutely convinced that the European Union needs to create a development strategy for non‐food agricultural products and that the Commission needs to include a specific section on such products in the CAP reform. In fact, these non‐food agricultural products are able to meet a large number of needs in terms of agriculture and rural development. For example they can meet needs relating to food production control, diversification and employment, and they can help maintain a rural bias in industrial spheres in the production of new renewable materials and meet general interest needs regarding the protection of the biosphere. All of these elements will very positively help define a specific European agriculture model.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, on behalf of the UPE Group, I have tabled three amendments along these lines, in the context of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report.</p>

The effects of this are well‐known and included discrimination between farmers, regions and products. In addition, its consequences, particularly for my country have become clear in recent years and include reducing the number of holdings and jobs, abandoning and emptying the countryside and ruining family‐based agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals must therefore be changed by radically altering their orientation. The support for large farmers and holdings must be drastically limited and the aid to family‐based agriculture and small and medium‐sized holdings must be significantly increased through positive and genuine modulation. Furthermore, sufficient resources must be provided to finance a common policy which aims to include new countries struggling with the fall in prices and the American requirements in terms of the next WTO round of talks. Finally, it must be reaffirmed here and now that the recent cofinancing proposal, that is, the recent proposed renationalisation of the costs, and only the costs, of the CAP, is not acceptable, neither in the light of solidarity nor on the basis of the Treaties. The recent rejection of the proposed regulations in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a sign which must be fully respected by the Commission and particularly by the Council.</p>

The compensatory payments to farmers do not, however, cover the resulting loss of income, and thus endanger the farming community. The Commission proposals are geared towards the world market. The European farming industry is, however, very diverse and structured in smaller units than is the case in the United States, for example; it is hard to make a direct comparison.</p>
<p class="contents">Even US experts warned that full‐blown liberalisation would threaten international agricultural commodities markets with the same fate as that of US farmers – a loss of income of 16 % – and advocated market stabilisation measures. Quantity management must continue to form part of the market organisations. We need farmers who maintain the ecological balance and care for the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Linking compensatory payments to environmental requirements is desirable and important, but for this to be fair, it has to be done on the basis of uniform European environmental standards. This reform package would continue to sound the death knell for farmers. It is not acceptable in its present form.</p>
