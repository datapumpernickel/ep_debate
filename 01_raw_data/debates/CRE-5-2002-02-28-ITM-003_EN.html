<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">– (DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the unique thing about the Youth Programme is that it really is open to all young people and, at an age when characters are formed, facilitates direct European experiences to do that, and gives their lives the European dimension. The European Youth Programme was adopted on 13 April 2000 and runs for seven years up to 2006. It is aimed at young people of between 15 and 25 years of age as well as at people involved in the youth work field and is funded with EUR 520 million. Thirty countries take part in the programme – the Member States, and also Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the candidate countries with the exception of Turkey and Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">Its management is highly decentralised, so that 70% is spent via the national agencies. In 2000, 10 029 projects, costing something over EUR 80 million, were financed, enabling 103 784 participants to be involved, which corresponds to an implementation rate of 98.5%, which is an excellent quota, bearing in mind the late start to the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As we had wished, it was possible, in the various actions, to achieve balanced allocation of resources between youth exchange and voluntary service. We would, though, like the Commission to give us even clearer and sounder figures for the five action areas when the more detailed report is forthcoming. Action 1 – Youth for Europe – covers meetings of groups of young people and youth exchange, and Action 2 – European voluntary service – is aimed at young people who go to another country for between six and twelve months to do voluntary work. Action 3 comprises initiatives in the field of youth work, Action 4 supports initiatives that transcend the boundaries of Socrates and Leonardo. In 2000, there were no projects in Action 5, which deals with support measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and over again, in the first year of the programme, we heard complaints about the length of time it took to process applications. As a rule, it took four to five months from the date the application was made for the centrally-managed projects to grant funds. Thankfully, the Commission picked up on our criticism in the course of the procedure and arranged for things to be speeded up. I hope that we will continue to work well with the Commission in this area in order to guarantee the participants in the projects speedy and unbureaucratic procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also start-up problems in the distribution of the appropriations for the programme to the national agencies. I hope that the funds advanced do not give rise to further incidental costs and make matters too difficult for the projects. It is extremely difficult to carry out a gender-specific assessment of the programme. I would like us to get more precise data from the Commission and for them to take care to work towards gender balance in the participants, in order, above all, that young women, including those from groups of disadvantaged young people, do not lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Parliament's priorities was to involve disadvantaged young people in the programme to a greater extent. According to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were able to include disadvantaged young people. This was more difficult in the decentralised projects. There is a need for further work here. There is also a need to improve the way national agencies share experience with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of the candidate countries was accompanied by some difficulties, with the legal basis being adopted rather late in the day and the granting of visas often being problematic. It is my plea, as a matter of urgency, for participants from the candidate countries to receive visas automatically, in an unbureaucratic way and without charge. Overall administration costs in the first year were very high, and this was because the Commission had met the costs for two years in advance. I think that is acceptable. We also welcomed the objective of involving smaller organisations without international experience, so that young people who are not members of organisations can also have better access to the programme. We intend to be continually on the ball about this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because I believe that our successes need to be sold better and with vigour that I suggest that we mount a week-long campaign in order to present the programme to the public. Let me say in conclusion that the Member States must not cut back on their own youth exchange programmes. They must introduce the European dimension into their national policies to a greater extent. We are getting encouraging indications from the process of consultation on the White Paper and I hope that the Youth Programme's new impetus for Europe's young people will give us the core of this new youth policy.</p>

The rationale behind the choice of these programmes can be traced back to the decisive consideration that the programmes in question are surely the Community's most important support programmes in the fields of education, youth, and European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Being aware of the importance of these specific areas, Parliament has, moreover, let itself be guided by the allocation of substantial funding and the recent extension into 2006. Nor should we forget the legislative processes initiated by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. We explicitly welcome the formation of an evaluation group, whose objective must be to closely supervise Parliament's implementation of Community programmes. We welcome the initiative taken in forming the evaluation group as well as that to extend this control machinery on the basis of new instruments and appropriate structures.</p>
<p class="contents">We also emphasise that it is heavy demand from within the Member States that has led to the Socrates, Youth, and Culture 2000 programmes being allocated additional resources. We had to take note of the fact that the programmes' low level of implementation during 2000 was attributable to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures. Parliament therefore expects the Commission to guarantee more efficient implementation, not least in order to help Europe's credibility in the eyes of its citizens and taxpayers. It is with concern that we observe bottlenecks, especially within the centralised management framework. Here of all places, attention should be paid to the utilisation of financial assets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a significant step in the right direction to further decentralise the administration of the programme, yet, thinking in terms of a united Europe, we must not forget that, as regards the determining of the programmes' political orientation, the sole competence of the institutions must be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That there is a European identity over and above all national differences has never been a matter of dispute. The wonderful thing is, though, that more and more Europeans are experiencing this in their daily lives. The European youth and education programmes, of which this Youth programme is one, have played a great part in this success. As the rapporteur has just said, it is one of the Community's most important support programmes, being the only one open to all young people without reference to their working or educational situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard that over 10 000 projects, with over 100 000 participants, were financed in 2000 alone. We see this success as considerable, as we are talking here only about the first year of implementation. Good news like this should not, of course, have a detrimental effect on the Member States' national youth programmes, which could perhaps take the Youth programme's success as a pretext for cutting back on their own resources. I will therefore reiterate that the Youth programme was created in order to support and supplement the Member States' actions, rather than to discharge the Member States from their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite on the contrary, the countries participating in the programme should make it easier for young people with an interest in the programme to take part in it, by reducing the administrative expenditure and, as the report was right to observe, granting the participants visas, where necessary, automatically and free of charge. One of this programme's important objectives is the greater involvement of disadvantaged young people, for whom, according to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were intended.</p>
<p class="contents">Short-term voluntary service, which was created especially for disadvantaged young people, has, however, not yet been made use of to a satisfactory extent, and the objective set of 20% of these resources was not attained. I see that, though, as appropriate. It is appropriate in terms of the programme's resources, rated at just about EUR 80 million, and of the relatively high administrative costs of EUR 12 million, and the Commission should succeed in achieving this objective. I take the view that such high administrative costs are defensible if new sources of participants are actually found and disadvantaged young people are brought into the programme to an appreciable degree.</p>

<p class="contents">There are numerous positive points, but I should like to comment on what I think is one of the problems. The Youth programme is very mean towards a particularly vulnerable group of young people in Europe. I refer to young immigrants. By ignoring their specific needs, by overlooking the additional problems which they face and by failing to dedicate special actions to their social integration, it is in effect slamming the door in their face. And yet it is the young immigrants now at the heart of Europe who, with all the other young people, are building the future of Europe. We therefore need special support for these vulnerable groups if we are to avoid ghettos and exclusion and ensure they become productive and creative. Whereas, I see the risk here of the programme's favouring groups of more privileged young people who are drip-fed on state benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like the Commissioner to go beyond the Youth programme and, instead of focusing on young people over 18 years old, to spare a thought for the fact that their formative years are during childhood. There are tens of millions – the figure is somewhere in the region of 60 million – children under 18 years of age in Europe and we should be looking at how a whole series of their rights are trampled underfoot at that tender age. Serious exploitation and myriad dangers jeopardise their formative, cultural and educational years.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need a dynamic European policy on children, we need someone to speak out on their behalf and effectively defend their material interests. Given that the UN is convening a summit in May to discuss reforming the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a summit which the European Parliament has asked to attend, it would be an excellent idea if the Commissioner were to take the initiative on a new, integrated and uniform policy on children and young people at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite a belated start, the YOUTH programme has proved to be an invaluable programme. Why is this programme valuable? It is important because one of its main objectives is to include a higher proportion of disadvantaged young people: individuals, groups, or organisations, which otherwise would have no access at all to any kind of European funding. There has been some criticism, of course, concerning the high administrative costs, as the programme comprises so many small projects, which are naturally therefore more expensive to administer.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been fortunate to have worked closely with a disadvantaged youth group from Wales, my own nation, who received funding under the programme. The young people involved gained so much and to see them speaking here in Brussels, some of whom were previously young offenders, highlighted to me the importance of this programme. The inclusion of worthwhile projects with disadvantaged youth groups, I assure you, is worth every penny of the expenditure. We must safeguard the programme and protect its main objectives of targeting disadvantaged young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fostering such abundance is indeed one of the Commission’s less controversial duties. The Gröner report is on the right lines. However, there are grounds for criticising the programmes we are debating today for two different sets of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is of a technical nature and is also contained in the various reports before us today. It concerns the programmes’ lack of transparency and their unwieldy nature. The application documents have driven everyone who sent for them to distraction. Maybe the documents are, in fact, some new form of art the Commission is nurturing. The main effect of streamlining procedures would be to do away with subsidies to intermediary bodies. These bodies aim to help artists and students to benefit from the much vaunted European funds but some of them are actually chaired by Members of the House. I have no wish to make any false assumptions. Nonetheless, blurring responsibilities in this way is most undesirable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of critical comments is of a political nature and concerns the thinly disguised intention of using these programmes as a basis to develop propaganda aimed at turning the younger citizens of our Member States into an a-national sub-species of ‘homo-europeus’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the time has come for us to make a real effort to ensure it is applied in all Member States, given that to not implement it would mean that we would not be able to profit from all the money we have invested in the preparation of this White Paper, which would be truly regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that young people are our future, the future of Europe and of a large part of the world, and this project is trying to bring the youth of more than thirty countries closer together. Therefore, we cannot allow the success of this programme to be tarnished by the excessively long periods needed to authorise projects or by delays in payments, although on this point I have to say that I was delighted to hear Mrs Gröner say that this problem is being solved during the course of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that Commission reports are clear and coherent, and, more than anything, that each year there is an annual report that covers all the National Youth Agencies. Additionally, administrative costs should not be too high and, lastly, I would like to ask the national governments for assistance in granting visas to those youths from outside the European Union who want to participate in these programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has always been a standard bearer for the young in the House, pressing for full commitment to a genuine policy for youth. Incidentally, in no way can youth policy be likened to propaganda. It is, in fact, the polar opposite. The Youth programme encourages people to get to know each other, it promotes additional languages, cultures, and freedom of expression. In so doing, the programme helps to foster fundamental values such as tolerance, diversity and solidarity. These are the foundations on which the citizens’ Europe must be built. Every year we make it possible for hundreds of thousands of young people to work together, to interact with their peers and with other cultures, and to commit themselves to helping those in greatest need to improve their lot in society. This is indeed civilising work, not mere propaganda</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to deal with the various issues that the speakers have raised. We have endeavoured to improve the management of the programme and to make it easier to participate. A number of Members have, in fact, recognised the effort made in recent years and months. We have already succeeded in reducing the time it takes to come to a decision. I do not claim that things are perfect, but they are far better than they were at the outset. I can assure you that we will persevere to ensure that simplified administrative procedures and shorter decision-making processes become the norm.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers highlighted the significance of opening this programme up to disadvantaged youngsters. I was delighted to hear Members refer to specific cases illustrating how disadvantaged youngsters have benefited from the programmes. The programmes helped participants to develop as persons and integrate into society. This good work will, of course, continue. You will be aware that 50% of the centralised projects are open to these young people. We shall do our best to ensure that the remaining projects become more accessible to them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should mention that the priorities, namely combating racism and xenophobia, are to be strengthened in 2002. These priorities will be taken into account both at country level by those countries involved in the programme and at the level of activities involving third countries, especially in the Mediterranean area. It has been shown that youth exchanges and dialogue help to nip problems in the bud so they do not develop further. A willingness to be receptive to others and try to understand them is the basis of a harmonious society.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of girls. We most certainly want the Youth programmes to reach out to girls too. I can assure you here and now that we are close to equality and that the programme is open to almost 50% of girls. The Euromed Youth programme is still causing concern, due to low female participation. At the beginning of the year I met with the Youth Ministers of the Maghreb countries and made it abundantly clear that we hope to see at least 50% female participation there as well. The reason is that we are trying to help build a harmonious society in those countries also, and the ‘feminine influence’ tends to promote peace. It is therefore essential to ensure female participation in the Youth programmes to attain the desired results.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you are doubtless aware that the Youth policy was totally transformed following large-scale consultation with hundreds of thousands of young people in all Member States. Young people were given an opportunity to express what they expect of Europe, and they were listened to. Their ideas have been incorporated into the White Paper on Youth. This direct exchange of views with young people is set to continue in 2002. A series of meetings is planned. An electronic portal is also in place, so young people can access information on Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to inform the House that the Euromed Youth II programme has just been launched. EUR 14 million is allocated to it for the period 2002-2004, which represents a 40% increase in available funds. This is very significant, because we need to foster links with countries in the southern Mediterranean and in northern Africa in order to promote better understanding and to ensure that immigrants to Europe from those areas provide solutions rather than creating additional difficulties. In the same spirit, the intercultural dialogue is to be extended to include the countries of south-eastern Europe and the Community of Independent States. In addition, further programmes have been launched with enlargement in mind. They aim to facilitate more youth exchanges in border regions in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
