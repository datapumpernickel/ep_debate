<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mastorakis (PSE)</span></span>  <span class="bold"><span class="italic">,</span></span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we shall, I think, wrap up the parliamentary procedure to establish a European Maritime Safety Agency. The three parties involved, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have, I think, worked well together on the common objective of completing the procedure as quickly as possible, and all the members of the institutions involved in the procedure deserve our congratulations. Just to recap, in completing the first reading last June, Parliament adopted seventeen amendments, the main purpose of which was to strengthen the agency's independence vis-à-vis the Commission, to strengthen the powers of its administrative board, to allow Member States to ask the agency for technical assistance in certain cases and to include a provision on combating fraud. As regards the composition of the administrative board, Parliament rejected the involvement of European Parliament representatives in this agency, taking the view that experience in maritime safety should be the criterion for the appointment of members. Finally, it demanded that the evaluation report on the agency's activities be carried out by external experts.</p>
<p class="contents">In its common position, the Council accepted the European Parliament amendments which provide for the power of the agency to assist states applying for accession without the specific request of the Commission, the obligation of the agency to forward the findings of its visits to the Member States, not only to the Commission but also to the Member State concerned, the purely consultative role of the Commission in the adoption by the administrative board of the agency's work programme, the obligation to appoint members of the administrative board on the basis of their degree of relevant experience within the remit of the agency, the obligation of the executive director to respond to any requests for assistance from a Member State, the power of the administrative board to appoint or dismiss the executive director, with the Commission entitled to propose candidates who need not necessarily be appointed, and the concern to combat fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of Parliament's amendments were partially incorporated in the common position, such as the provision concerning the composition of the agency's administrative board, on which Parliament decided not to be represented and which will finally consist of one representative from each Member State, four Commission representatives and four professionals appointed by the Commission, and the provision referring to the procedure for drawing up the work programme, where the Council specified that the executive director would submit the work programme to the administrative board after consulting the Commission and not just once it had received preliminary approval. This also applies to most of the provisions concerning the agency's budget and the provisions regarding the evaluation of the agency within five years of the agency taking up its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The new elements introduced by the Council in the proposal for a regulation include the rewording of Article 2 on the duties of the agency which makes the text clearer without altering its content, a reference to transparency and the protection of information, the removal of the reference to the seat of the agency, not that this will stop me from referring to it, the special adoption procedure for the work programme in the event of disagreement by the Commission, the representation of all the Member States on the administrative board and the participation of professionals not representative of branches without the right to vote, the power of the administrative board to examine specific issues without the presence of its professional members and the possibility of appointing or dismissing the executive director by a special majority of four-fifths of members.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the above, we find that, in formulating its common position, the Council has taken account wholly or partly of a significant number of European Parliament amendments and that, generally, the Council has adhered to the spirit of the original proposal, which seeks to address problems in the sector of maritime safety and protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we would draw your attention to the following points in the common position: representatives of professional branches are excluded and replaced by professionals appointed by the Commission who have no right to vote but may be excluded from meetings where this is considered advisable. A curious procedure has been introduced for the adoption of the agency's work programme in the event of disagreement by the Commission and, in order to maintain the balance between the two institutions, the common position requires, for the programme to be adopted in this specific instance, either a majority of two-thirds of members, but including the Commission representatives, or a unanimous vote by the representatives of the Member States. This ensures the balance between the Council and the Commission, if at the expense of making the decision-taking procedure more difficult. Apart from these reservations, the common position should be welcomed because it corresponds to Parliament's main objective, which is to make maritime transport safer and protect the maritime environment. We believe that this proposal must be adopted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the seat of the new agency is concerned, I trust that it will be located in a city with a large, very old port, near a modern airport with direct flights to all the countries of the European Union, with all the necessary infrastructure, in a country of islands with a maritime history stretching back thousands of years, with the biggest merchant fleet in the world. Obviously, I am referring to Luxembourg... </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that his work has been serious and responsible and that furthermore he has been able to bring together a consensus within the committee which has meant that today we are able to hold a debate and approve during this plenary a report which has been difficult and complicated and which has been drawn up as a result of his work and I believe that this achievement deserves credit.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, if you will allow me, Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the Vice-President on behalf of my group, since if one thing characterises the work over these years, it is reflected in this report: it has been a challenge which stems from the problems relating to accidents off European coasts and a challenge from the public, and it is work which has resulted in the creation of various safety agencies (at the moment we are witnessing the creation of the Maritime Safety Agency) and furthermore it is a shared challenge, supported by the parliamentary committee. Furthermore, I believe the really positive thing is that, in her work, the Vice-President has the trust of the parliamentary committee and this takes the form – if we look back at events over these three years – of the support she has received for her management and her projects, which in many cases have been controversial and complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, together with this agency, we are trying to adopt one of the multiple measures proposed by the Commission to respond to a European public demand: safety at sea. And we now have a challenge; that that agency should function transparently and efficiently, but that it should not only function in relation to the two important challenges – that of the safety of sea transport, including passenger and coastal shipping, and that of the protection of the marine environment – but also in relation to those small details and areas which are not apparently as essential as the big issues, such as recreational boating – including the issue of jet skis and speed-boats which cause concern amongst the citizens of Europe. I believe that the agency is able to respond to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that this response should be a quick one so that the work of the Commission and the work of Parliament are shown to be connected and capable of responding to the concerns of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, on behalf of the Socialist Group, for the way in which he has skilfully piloted this part of the Erika package through Parliament, keeping all sides together. The fact that we have a better product at the end of the process than we did at the beginning is a tribute to his skill in particular. This is the final part of the Erika package so we also ought to thank the Commissioner, who has been working relentlessly to ensure that disasters like the Erika and so many others in EU waters in recent years do not occur again.</p>
<p class="contents">We did have many new laws in the 80s and 90s, but they were not fully implemented or complied with. I hope that this new EU initiative, the Maritime Safety Agency, will coordinate, monitor and enforce maritime law. I hope it will come up with fresh proposals where necessary, but in an open and transparent way. We all hope that it will work with us in the European Parliament to make our seas safer and protect our coastal environment.</p>
<p class="contents">For too long in Europe, the laws of the sea were more appropriate to the 19th than the 21st century. I hope that by agreeing to endorse the Commissioner's recommendation and the common position we can help modernise EU maritime safety and have EU safety laws that we can all be proud of, but of course the proof will be when we no longer have terrible maritime disasters. You can never have 100% safety, but this proposal will do a lot to make our seas safer, save lives and protect our coastal environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank Mr Mastorakis for his magnificent work. As he pointed out, we are coming to the end of the negotiation, since Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 5 are accepted by the Commission, because they clearly improve the text we received from the Council. And not only are they supported by the Commission, but this morning the relevant group in the Council has expressed its support and willingness to incorporate and accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">We can therefore conclude this negotiation, the approval of this legislative text, if tomorrow Parliament supports the text with these amendments, which would then be approved by the Council at its next meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, as Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Watts pointed out a moment ago, we have been debating maritime safety for a year and a half now. We have confronted challenges and we have cooperated in order to prevent a repetition of horrendous events such as the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which not only endanger human lives, but which also pollute the sea with terrible consequences for the inhabitants of coastal areas and for flora and fauna and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the six initiatives which made up the Erika I and Erika II packages, this is the fifth. The sixth initiative, the only one we are yet to deal with, the most essential, the increase in the guarantee of the level of support and the guarantee relating to oil pollution is being debated at the moment within the International Maritime Organisation, and let us hope that a decision will be achieved which will allow for an international solution, since the maritime sector is an international one, and which does not oblige us to turn to a European initiative. An international solution would be much more positive.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is achieved, as we hope it will be, within the International Maritime Organisation, it would be the last initiative for the Erika I and Erika II packages and we would have concluded our work. In this regard, I would like to thank all of you and in particular the various rapporteurs who have been involved in the different proposals – the five of them – which we have debated and worked on, but also the whole House and particularly the services of the Commission, of the TREN Directorate-General, since it is thanks to their effort, their work, their professionalism and the speed with which they have responded that we have got this far.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Council for having responded for once to what the citizens are asking us for: that we provide a framework for greater safety and greater protection for the maritime sector in general and for pollution caused by the dumping of oil in particular. Such a tough reality has allowed us to move ahead on other initiatives which will improve maritime safety and benefit maritime traffic and therefore the maritime sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much. I believe we will now very possibly be able to conclude the Erika package and the agency will be implemented as soon as possible, but, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not us who decide the headquarters, but we hope that the next European Council will come to an agreement and finally tell us where it will be, and the sooner the better, since it is very urgent. Thank you very much, Mr Mastorakis. Thank you very much, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
