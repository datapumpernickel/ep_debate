In fact, the situation of Romania and Bulgaria can be compared to a football match which both countries have lost, not on the pitch, but through a random decision. Although they trained hard for it and played very well technically, both countries have failed to qualify for the ‘Schengen League’ because some referees decided that the original rules and fair play do not matter and have devised new rules, right in the middle of the game, which no one is actually familiar with, but which have extremely serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally wish to thank the Polish Presidency for the constant efforts it has made, aimed at achieving my country’s accession to the Schengen area. However, the fact that we are debating a resolution today on a matter which we already decided by vote four months ago highlights what a tough stalemate the European Union is currently in. This is why I find it absurd that we have two versions of the truth, one from the European Parliament and the other from the Council, about the freedom of movement within Europe’s borders. I am sure that the authorities and officials in the Netherlands and Finland understand that European citizens have rights which cannot be interpreted and applied differently, according to the nationality or ethnic group they belong to by birth. However, they have given in to trivial, though vociferous domestic pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">If we feel a sense of responsibility, we cannot allow a new split in Europe: either east-west or north-south. This is precisely what the far-right parties are expecting, that people, feeling duped and confused, will refuse to be governed from Brussels any longer. This is why the double standards must be dropped from both the speeches made by Europe’s political leaders and from their decisions. If these double standards had not existed, Romania and Bulgaria would have already been part of the Schengen area, and this decision would have produced a positive impact on the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What hypocrisy! True, the Netherlands and Finland were the ones who vetoed this application, but the majority of the Member States, starting with France and Germany, seem to share their misgivings. Yet Romania and Bulgaria have now fulfilled the conditions that were imposed on new members in 2008, and they seem to be even better prepared than some of the countries that were accepted without hesitation at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for so-called guarantees regarding the fight against corruption and organised crime has been cited. Dare I say it, that is a load of rubbish. What is the sad reality? The political developments in a number of Member States are the only real reason for this refusal. Xenophobia is increasingly undermining Europe, and fears are being played on, because the underlying reason for this refusal is still the fear of a lack of border controls, and it shows what the reality of the Schengen area is.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the so-called principle of the free movement of persons work if some European citizens are denied that which is granted to citizens of non-EU countries? The reality of the Schengen area is that it is increasingly becoming a security area in the strictest sense of the word, a security-based police area that allows Europe to turn in on itself. It is a fortress Europe that refuses to take in a few million Tunisians or to reach out to a few dozen Libyan refugees. The Finnish and Dutch governments’ courting of popular opinion and, hence, voters, is broadly supported in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Can it explain to us which new criteria are going to be imposed on Romania and Bulgaria? When will the same principle of reversed qualified majority voting that is applied to economic matters be introduced for matters relating to human rights, justice and freedom? For how long are we going to let the Union drift, and for how long will the interests of the few continue to take precedence over the general interest? Yes, the European Union has a governance problem, but it is not a problem of economic governance; it is a problem of political governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The continuing delay and blocking by Member States, in particular, the Netherlands and Finland, of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> risks creating that two-tier system for EU Member States. Bulgaria and Romania have met the criteria to join Schengen, the same criteria that were applied to each Member State that has previously joined the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Furthermore, this has been judged and verified by the independent expert EU committee, yet some Member States are now taking the political initiative of blocking their accession on the basis that they have serious levels of corruption and organised crime. Of course corruption and organised crime are serious issues, but the approach to these serious issues is disingenuous and is creating a problem with one of the key principles of the European Union and its freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an ongoing evaluation mechanism to judge organised crime and corruption, but we must not pervert that mechanism in creating a two-tier system for these countries. The Member States should be treated equally and fairly. We work hard to tackle all forms of discrimination and we have to ensure that we do not allow for the creation of a subsidiarity position for Romania and Bulgaria. Of course we welcome efforts to strengthen and improve the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>; re-evaluating any legislation is necessary to improve it and adapt it to be able to best respond to current demands and situations. However, the rules that we create must also be respected by all Member States in Council. It should not be that we negotiate EU legislation which is then ignored by some Member States and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to strengthen Schengen and ensure that an instrument which was created for solidarity purposes across the EU – for the freedom of individuals across the EU – is not now used to divide it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it undertook to comply with the obligations contained in the Schengen Agreement and fulfil the provisions included in the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism relating to justice and the fight against corruption. Both commitments include separately requirements and sanctions in the event of non-compliance. The mechanism is still applicable. The Commission drafts progress reports every year and has the option to apply the stipulated sanctions in the event of failing to comply with the scheduled phases. The Schengen road map has been fulfilled in its entirety, in keeping with current EU provisions, which was confirmed by the decision made by the JHA Council in June this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the European Council in June, including Romania, proposed a review of the Schengen criteria, but clearly stated in the conclusions that this proposal would not affect the accession process involving Romania and Bulgaria. Unfortunately, the JHA Council has not kept to its own decision in June and did not adopt any decision in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation we are in is completely unclear, with no sign of hope, where a Member State is fulfilling its obligations, but is being blocked, and we might even say, punished by other Member States without any legally justified reasons. Furthermore, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission is the only body which can propose sanctions against a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is based on a number of principles, including trust and, in particular, mutual respect. In the current situation, I believe that the European Council needs to intervene.

<p class="contents">These are not the words of the populist parties and movements, but of Europol in its 2010 report on organised crime. There is no populist propaganda, but a serious security problem. Were Bulgaria to join the Schengen area at this time, law enforcement and security agencies predict that Bulgaria’s borders, especially its maritime ones, would become easy targets for organised crime syndicates from Eastern Europe and Turkey, and Bulgaria and Romania would become the crossroads for trafficking of human beings and drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is natural that some Member States should have many reservations about the real capacity of Bulgaria and Romania to ensure effective border control against organised crime and corruption, and so it is quite natural that they should oppose their membership of Schengen. Allowing them in now means opening the door to transnational organised crime syndicates and opening a gaping hole in Europe’s borders where there is intense migratory pressure from Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many reasons to oppose this and Europe cannot ignore them. I would therefore like to know what the intentions of the Commission and Council are on this delicate question, which I think has so far been treated recklessly, without taking into account the dangers that the entry of Bulgaria and Romania would entail, according to the competent bodies dealing with security and international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission and the Council should postpone the entry of these two countries into Schengen and give the go-ahead only when there is reasonable assurance that the entry of Bulgaria and Romania will have no impact on the security of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the question of Bulgaria and Romania’s accession to the Schengen area is so particularly important to members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you all know that the Council discussed this matter at the meeting of 22-23 September on the basis of a compromise proposal put forward by the Presidency. It was drafted in response to fears – expressed earlier by some Member States – over the initial request for a decision on a framework for full application of the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it became clear that it would be impossible to guarantee the unanimous support within the Council which is essential to reaching agreement. Therefore, the Presidency decided not to put the request for a Council decision to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, as you know, the Act of Accession of 2005 provides for verification through an evaluation procedure in order to guarantee that Bulgaria and Romania fulfil the conditions necessary for application of all parts of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>. This is an essential condition for the Council so that it can – after consultations with the European Parliament – decide on full application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the consequent abolition of checks at internal borders and at borders between these two Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These evaluations were carried out between 2009 and 2011. After completion of the evaluation process, on 9 June this year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted conclusions corroborating the fact that the necessary preconditions enabling the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal air, land and sea borders have been met. The Council also agreed that it would come back to this matter as soon as possible and not later than September this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish Presidency submitted a compromise proposal to the Council. This proposal provided for the gradual abolition of internal border checks: initially at air and sea borders, and then at land borders. This proposal was also the fruit of a process of intensive discussions with the Member States, including, of course, Bulgaria and Romania. As I have already said, it did not receive the necessary unanimous support.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still treating the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area as a priority, and we are involved in work which will enable a quick decision to be made on this matter. The Polish Presidency is determined to ensure that agreement is reached quickly on this matter, and to this end we are going to continue to work on a balanced approach which will allay the specific fears expressed by some Member States while also providing for the abolition of checks at land borders in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will keep Parliament informed about this situation as it develops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Chamber has already made its position clear and we reiterate it today: namely, that Bulgaria and Romania should be allowed to join Schengen once they fulfil the entry conditions. We say this out of a basic sense of fairness and respect for the rule of law, so we are very surprised and deeply disappointed that, despite Bulgaria’s and Romania’s having fulfilled the conditions for membership – the same conditions that were applied to all the rest of us – the Council failed to ratify the decision to give them the green light.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that this happened because of the opposition of two Member States – the Netherlands and Finland – which wield a veto on the decision. That is disappointing because both these countries have a strong European tradition of respect for fairness and the rule of law. As it happens, both their governments rely on the support of populist parties. I would not like to think that the reason for the blockage is that these governments are held hostage to populism, because that would be very worrying indeed. We need to stand up to populism by explaining to the public that fairness dictates respect for the rules, and that when the rules are respected, we should draw the appropriate conclusions: in this case, by allowing both Bulgaria and Romania to join the border-free area of Schengen. We should not be afraid to explain this to the public. We should not be afraid of taking fair decisions, and we should not be afraid to show political responsibility. Not to do so would be to move the goalposts after the game has started, and that is simply not fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is obviously not interested in this or in the will of MEPs, preferring to take part in the pre-election campaign in Bulgaria rather than deal with this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We are urging with today’s resolution for both the Commissioners and ministers of the Council to become fully involved in making a decision or setting a definite timetable for Bulgaria and Romania to join Schengen. This case involving the accession of both countries is an extremely serious matter because it casts doubt over the effectiveness of European law. The criteria for becoming members of this area have been fulfilled, but no decision has been made. The Council has put the Commission and all of us in a legal tangle, as it allowed new requirements to be imposed on both countries during the same accession procedure. The European Commission must issue a much tougher response to this behaviour from the Council as it is the guardian of the Treaties and oversees their compliance. The European Commission must ensure that the new package being proposed for assessing compliance with the Schengen criteria will be complied with by all Member States and will not be dependent on political realities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to reply to Ms Bizzotto by quoting a statement made today by our Socialist colleague: ‘If we had a similar attitude to combating crime and corruption in Member States as to Bulgaria and Romania, Italy ought to have left Schengen a long time ago’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we need to do from now on, so new and existing Schengen members are properly evaluated and, if necessary, sanctioned. But, for the time being, apply the rules.</p>

<p class="contents">Some Member States have shown their reservations about Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area – and they do this despite the Romanian and Bulgarian people having worked so incredibly hard to meet the criteria that have been set for them – but calling those reservations xenophobic or racist, as we heard a moment ago, is a cheap and unworthy suggestion.</p>

Double standards were applied to Bulgaria and Romania throughout the whole process of their accession to the European Union. I have been listening to us for six years in this Chamber denying that double standards are applied. Nevertheless, the negotiations were conducted based on double standards and the accession process was a glaring example of double standards because Bulgaria and Romania were separated from the other 10 countries in the fifth enlargement round. Double standards apply to the process for joining the euro. Now it is the turn of Schengen – the next example of double standards. In fact, look at who is imposing a veto – the Netherlands – a country which recently showed that it actually does not want to be part of Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not whether Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the criteria, nor is it even the desire of the Dutch and Finnish governments to apply double standards. The problem lies, ladies and gentlemen, in the actual system which you federalists have set up – a crazy, absurd and pointless system which needs to be scrapped and does not have any kind of practical use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The president of the opposition youth group has been beaten by Ukrainian police, along with other leaders, and their homes have been raided and searched without warrants.

In fact, at the moment, it embodies all the ills which have been afflicting the European Union for some time: ignorance about European rules and treaties, populism, nationalism, the decline of solidarity and denial of basic rights, such as the right to free movement. I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to remind everyone of the values on which the European Union is founded and to condemn the selfish, anti-European behaviour displayed by some Member States, ensnared by far-right populism.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, said recently, the vote of a minority should not dictate the will of the large majority and the EU.

<p class="contents">The resolution which we are going to vote on tomorrow is not just about Romania and Bulgaria.

<p class="contents">As politicians, we need to keep an eye open to what things are actually like in everyday reality and what they look like in theory. I have alerted you to this and that is why I am saying that neither of the countries are up to scratch; reality still differs too much from theory.</p>

We all know that Bulgaria and Romania continue to face very serious problems, such as organised crime and corruption. Those are problems that will, by definition, spill over into other Member States when the borders disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is also the problem of Bulgaria not yet having taken a number of measures in order to enhance its cooperation with Greece and Turkey on improving border management. The problem of mass illegal migration via Turkey is well known. The countries which are opposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area are not doing so merely in their own national interests, but also in the interests of all Member States of the European Union, because the Schengen area can only work if there is confidence that all Member States are fully complying with all conditions.</p>

Unfortunately, the reality in Europe is different. Member States are not abiding by the rules they have adopted. The upshot of this is that we have an economic and financial crisis and we have Bulgaria’s and Romania’s Schengen membership being blocked. The actual reality is as follows: both countries fulfilled all the criteria which were used to assess the countries that joined Schengen at an earlier stage and which were enshrined in the accession treaties. There is not a single argument to support the notion that the two countries’ accession poses a risk to the Schengen area. On the contrary, allow me to support with facts the argument that Bulgaria contributes to the security of Europe’s citizens. Both Bulgaria and Romania became part of the Schengen Information System in November 2010. Since the start of November 2010 up until 11 October 2011, according to the data, Bulgaria has provided Schengen Member States with information about the following matters: 323 persons wanted for arrest; 1 383 motor vehicles, personal documents, weapons and other personal items being sought in Schengen area countries; 92 missing persons; 1 208 persons involved in criminal proceedings in the Schengen area; 737 persons discreetly monitored; and more than 8 000 rejected visa applications for entering the Schengen area. Bulgaria and Romania always perform their duty of solidarity to all the other citizens in the European Union.</p>

It is common knowledge that both Bulgaria and Romania have problems with corruption, organised crime and the jurisdictional system.</p>
<p class="contents">The core of the problem, however, is probably that Bulgaria and Romania were not completely ready for EU membership at the time of their accession to the European Union. Many political reforms remained half-complete and the EU, as is well known, has no means at its disposal for bringing its Member States under control.

I am in two minds about Romania’s accession to the Schengen area. On the one hand, eliminating the existing national borders would be in the interests both of the Hungarian community in Transylvania and of Hungary itself. It would also mean the elimination of the unjust borders imposed upon Hungary under the Treaty of Trianon. At the same time, however, I also understand the Dutch and the Finns in the sense that we have to look at the crime statistics too.

For that reason, the situation with regard to Bulgaria and Romania must be examined as a whole, because the internal security situation of a potentially acceptable Member State cannot reflect negatively on the other Schengen states. When the Schengen rules are enforced, it is particularly important that a Member State is able to fight corruption and organised crime and that the judicial systems of countries work effectively. Bulgaria and Romania must genuinely fulfil these requirements before they can be accepted into the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">A report under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), published in the spring, stated that both countries were showing progress but that there were still serious weaknesses. That is why the conclusions drawn by Finland and the Netherlands are, I think, clear. Technical readiness is not enough if we cannot persuade people to accept that border guards cannot be bribed. In Finland, attention has also focused on the weak position of the Roma minority and on the fact that many Roma have had to leave their homeland to apply for asylum or to beg elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the security of the area of free movement, it is sensible to encourage Romania and Bulgaria to make efforts to enable their accession to the Schengen area. The next natural review date falls next spring, when we can expect to receive the Commission’s interim report.</p>

If you move the goalposts in the middle of a match, you create distrust. What are the agreements we are making here with each other now worth? That is why it is important that we deliver on the promises we have already made. Romania and Bulgaria are now feeling that they have been treated unfairly by the Member States. After all, they have fulfilled the requirements of the agreements on accession to the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some other agreements were made in 2007, too, at the time when these countries joined the EU: those on combating corruption. According to recent Commission reports, the results leave much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements may directly impact on the European area of freedom and security. Do not get me wrong. I want a strong Schengen area with Romania and Bulgaria, one that will ensure our citizens retain their faith in a Europe without internal borders. After all, the external borders will only be as strong as the weakest link. There should be no doubt about that, but doubt there is. I therefore ask the Council how they intend to resolve this?

They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join.

<p class="contents">Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> when they acceded to the Union in 2007.

Romania and Bulgaria meet all of the technical requirements and therefore they should also be permitted to participate in the Schengen cooperation. The Council’s blocking of these two States’ accession to Schengen is therefore against the rules. It is unacceptable to treat certain States one way and others another way, deviating from the rules that are in place.

The vague reasons given and any additional criteria conceal serious consequences. They are of fundamental importance in the long term.

The European Union needs to have a direction and not directions. It is imperative for Europe to be, and to be seen as, a real union. At present, Europe is not seen as a coherent entity. Because, in reality, it is not. Within the Union, a tug-of-war is being waged between those States which want more union and those States which want less union. We are trying to find compromises allowing Member States to choose and pick which initiatives they wish to participate in. Schengen is perhaps one of the best examples. But there are others like the eurozone. Selecting parts of a menu is resulting in a Europe <span class="italic">à la carte</span>. I have advocated that in order for Europe to be taken seriously and be seen as a meaningful power, it has to have a common project, a common aim, a common direction. This can only occur if further integration takes place. That is why – in spite of a number of difficulties – I am in favour of Bulgaria and Romania becoming part of Schengen. The more countries that participate in common initiatives, the more integrated we become. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order.

Two Member States are blocking Schengen accession for Romania and Bulgaria in the Council of Ministers. This undermines the EU’s credibility and legal certainty: we cannot apply double standards! Access to the Schengen area is also a matter of trust: should the task of guarding the EU’s external borders be entrusted to a country which, according to all the assessments, fully complies with all the prescribed criteria? The answer is unequivocal: yes. Unvoiced opinions and interests are at play behind the obstruction of Bulgaria and Romania’s Schengen accession, and this is further damaging public confidence. Delaying the enlargement of the Schengen area heightens the disappointment felt by the EU’s Bulgarian and Romanian citizens. The most likely victims of this frustration will be the disadvantaged communities that are being treated as scapegoats for the delay in reaching a decision on accession to Schengen. In the midst of a crisis, the last thing the EU needs is to sow distrust among the Member States and send feelings running even higher. We must make a clear stand in support of Schengen accession for Bulgaria and Romania and introduce an appropriate Schengen evaluation system as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, if Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the necessary conditions, it is not fair play to delay the decision on enlargement. We need decisions which are both rapid and carefully considered. Europe must be united. All the Member States should work together, not on their own, and for the common good, particularly now during the crisis in Europe. What we need is mutual cooperation and mutual trust.

For the moment, the Council has postponed their accession indefinitely, despite the fact that, according to the Commission’s progress reports, both countries had fulfilled all the required technical and legal criteria, which has also been reiterated by the Commissioner today. As a champion of transparency, the European Union cannot afford to discredit itself by applying the terms laid out in the EU Accession Treaties in an arbitrary manner. If the current criteria are deemed insufficient or incomplete, they should be amended accordingly in cooperation with the involved parties. Instead, the Council has opted for a political decision without a proper legal basis. Such discrepancies must be avoided in the future by exerting more foresight when devising any criteria that are to be applied in a uniform manner. Failure to live up to one’s principles at home also inflicts damage on the reliability of the EU abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled all the Schengen accession criteria. This has also been recognised by independent experts. However, certain EU Member States have mounted a political campaign aimed at preventing these two countries from joining the Schengen area for reasons of corruption and organised crime. These wounds run deep in Romania and Bulgaria. However, slamming the Schengen door shut is not the best means of healing them. The abandonment of these two nations outside the Schengen area is contributing to the creation of a two-speed Europe. I welcome the proposal that the European Council should fully analyse this issue and take an appropriate decision. I would like to congratulate the Polish Presidency of the EU, which is also seeking a solution that is as swift and smooth as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that while the European Union is delaying the decision without providing a proper explanation based on European law and in keeping with mutual trust among the Member States, Romania has complied fully with the accession criteria laid down in the Schengen Agreement. Some say that the unresolved issue of Romanian corruption is the reason why the decision on accession has been delayed. Aside from the fact that there is nothing in the law that connects Schengen accession and the extent of corruption in a given Member State, do you really think that corruption problems in some Member States should prompt the remaining Member States to exclude those countries from certain aspects of European integration? I do not think so. And I do not want to see this happening in the case of Romania and Bulgaria either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important matter, not only from the point of view of the citizens of those countries, but from the point of view of all the citizens of Europe. The free movement of people is one of the freedoms which the people who live in the European Union value the most. We should not artificially create difficulties and impose additional, previously unforeseen requirements on those two countries in particular. Protection against organised crime, drug dealing or money laundering is unquestionably important, but if both those Member States have improved their controls in these areas, in accordance with the rules of the Schengen system, they should not be blocked in this way on the grounds of widespread fears about unwanted immigration, for example, when there are often no specific data to support those fears. It is not acceptable to change the rules of play during the game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both countries took this process in good faith and prepared according to the rules. But something changed. There is a pressure to change the rules of the game during the game. This is not only unfair towards two Member States that were singled out. This is detrimental to the European solidarity principle. It happens at a most unfortunate time, when true European values are tested by radical agendas and political forces. The Schengen debate was largely absorbed by this sort of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution adopted today is a step in the right direction. The resolution proved that there is a consensus in the European Parliament on the need to promote the interests of a coherent and united Europe, especially in times of doubt and crisis. Romania and Bulgaria should not be treated differently. Once they fulfil the original criteria, they should be allowed to join the Schengen area. The same rules should work from now on for future candidates. The European Parliament always supported this approach.

In actual fact, these countries are already protecting the eastern borders according to the Schengen criteria, even though, officially, they are not part of the area. These are the facts, but this is where the problems start. The EU is divided over the measures to take to exit the growing financial and debt crisis when this union’s very existence is under threat. Two countries are blocking the Council’s decision on Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen without having any legal grounds whatsoever for this. It seems as if everyone is thinking about number one. This inevitably raises the question whether the EU can take tough decisions in such a complicated situation when the only response is more Europe, more synergy and solidarity, and not disunity and national protectionism. In light of this, the forthcoming Council meeting on 23 October will be a test of the EU’s ability and of whether its leaders are up to meeting the expectations of its citizens to take decisive actions to deal with the impending threats, which includes rejecting populist domestic policy objectives in order to save Europe. The decision on Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen will be part of this test. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
