<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Implications of tobacco advertising for Community competition policy</span></p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Following the statements to the press by representatives of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it seems that the FIA is threatening not to allow any further Formula 1 races to take place at any track in the EU Member States because of the new European directive on tobacco advertising which the Member States are required to transpose in 2005 at the latest. What conclusions does the Commission draw from this as regards competition law, particularly in the light of the agreements between the Commission and the FIA?</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of competition law, what is the Commission’s view regarding the FIA’s decision to leave it to the teams to decide whether to race or refuse to take part in races at tracks in Member States because of a law banning tobacco advertising during sporting events, in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice and the positions of the European Council, Commission and Parliament on sport? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the information we have at the moment, it was Mr Ecclestone himself, who represents the organisation responsible for promoting the Formula 1 championship, who declared publicly that the ban on sponsorship by the tobacco industry in the European Union, which is to come into effect before 2006, could lead to Formula 1 races being held outside the Union instead.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the International Automobile Federation, Mr Rod is, of course, aware of the FIA declaration on the sponsorship of motor racing by the tobacco industry and an international agreement providing for an effective ban in 2006. The FIA explains how Formula 1 races can be organised in France and the United Kingdom, even though these two countries have banned sponsorship by the tobacco industry. In addition, the Commission has received a statement announcing the exclusion of the Belgian Grand Prix on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit from the 2003 championship calendar on the grounds, it would appear, that the Belgian law banning tobacco product advertising and sponsorship is to enter into force during the course of this year. According to Mr Ecclestone’s statement, it would appear that the Austrian Grand Prix in Spielberg will suffer the same fate as of 2004, the date of entry into force of a similar ban in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of competition law, it is important for all the parties involved in the complex process of setting the Formula 1 championship calendar to stick to their own roles and responsibilities. It would seem that the decision to organise Formula 1 races in one country rather than another is a question of economic considerations rather than legal considerations applying to motor racing. The system developed by the various parties involved in Formula 1 racing through the agreements submitted to the Commission will continue to apply. As regards the specific case of Spa-Francorchamps, the Commission is ascertaining whether Community competition law has been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive of the European Parliament and Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products, which was the subject of a political Council agreement in December 2002, provides for a ban as of 31 July 2005 on the sponsorship of events involving or taking place in more than one Member State or having other cross-border effects, including, of course, Formula 1. The directive takes into account the fact that the laws of the different Member States on sponsorship linked to the promotion of tobacco products differ among themselves and that this could lead to distortion of competition. The directive seeks to eliminate these problems and approximate the provisions on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We raised this question, which we consider to be important, because although today it concerns the circuit at Spa-Francorchamps, it will of course also concern others likewise affected by this directive on tobacco. We personally, by the way, are strongly in favour of the directive banning tobacco advertising. We feel it is very important for health problems to take precedence over the problems raised by banning tobacco advertising and we are extremely concerned about the International Automobile Federation’s position in this regard. As you emphasised, and as already discussed with Commissioner Byrne, the latter is currently examining the possibility of extending the ban on tobacco advertising worldwide, in other words, working with the WHO on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the measures currently taken by the automobile federations are extremely worrying for those who are trying to limit any encouragement of smoking, which we all know is extremely harmful to health. Furthermore, the automobile federations’ measures will lead to distortions with regard to employment, and, in particular, in the field of sport, which will also be extremely damaging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If further decisions are taken here to ban advertising for sweets, cars and other categories of products, we will be faced with a problem with the market economy itself. You see, although these products are legal, it is not permitted to advertise them.

It must be said that my colleague, Commissioner Solbes Mira, is also very grateful that the honourable Member is with us since it gives him a couple of minutes to get down from the Commission meeting, which is still continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the honourable Member's important question. The Commission recognises the importance of enhancing the role of women in economic life in the partner countries around the Mediterranean. That was why we welcomed and supported the meeting held in July 2001 on this subject under the Belgian presidency of the Council. As a result of that meeting, the Commission included, among others, a regional programme on this subject under the MEDA Regional Indicative Programme for 2002-2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of limited resources, the Commission has to make difficult choices among priorities. Only about 10% of the MEDA programme is available for regional activities and this has to cover everything from supporting the rule of law and good governance to activities to promote regional integration and trade, plans for infrastructure interconnection and regulatory harmonisation, the dialogue of cultures and civilisations, support for judicial cooperation, the fight against organised crime and terrorism and activities related to migration.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the programme on 'The role of women in economic life' has been programmed for the year 2004 within the Regional Indicative Programme, with funding of EUR 5 million. In order to permit the launching of the programme in 2004, the identification and preparatory phase began in December last year and will end in April or May 2003 with a MEDA regional workshop.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to speed up the effective implementation of the programme, a call for proposals with a suspension clause will be published during the second half of 2003 on the basis of the results of that workshop.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional financing plan for 2004 should be presented to the Med Committee before the end of 2003 in order to permit the financing of the selected projects in the following year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps this programme, with its delays and miserly budget, is just an afterthought in the overall endeavour? Do you believe that this commitment on the part of the Commission will suffice? Should something more be done to integrate women economically, not just something more generous, such as small loans, proper jobs and training, but something to guarantee and fund mechanisms to monitor if these issues and challenges receive equal legal treatment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just a question of focusing on this programme. I am extremely keen, as we review our programmes for the future, to take on board the exceptionally important report which was recently produced by the UNDP. The honourable Member may recall that the UNDP, under the direction of their distinguished regional director who is, as it happens, a woman, has drawn up a report trying to answer the question of why Arab League countries have not prospered as much as other comparable societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to that question was clear: yes, there were problems of governance and the rule of law. Yes, there were problems about education, but there was also a very substantial problem of undervaluing women and the gender issue as a whole in economic, as well as social life in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very keen that we should try to look at our programmes in the region through the prism of that report, which importantly was not written by Europeans or Americans, but by Arabs: Arab men and women, Arab policy-makers, Arab journalists, Arab academics. They have given us an important wake-up call to look at these issues more seriously. I can assure the honourable Member that I take them very seriously indeed and that the Commission takes them very seriously. I am delighted that she has given me the opportunity of making that point - as are our subsequent questioners - and I am delighted that I have been able to speak at some length on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It increased up until the middle of the 1990s, reaching a peak of over 110% of GDP in 1996. This was the result of increasing budgetary imbalances and low growth in GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">The stabilisation efforts with a view to participation in Monetary Union and the improvement in the main macroeconomic indicators have contributed to reducing the ratio of debt, although at a very slow rate. The debt still represents 107% of GDP in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Three factors have influenced this development: the level of primary balance, that is, excluding financial payments, the nominal rate of growth of GDP and other autonomous or residual factors. Notable amongst those are the financial operations which do not affect the budgetary balance but the volume of debt. In fact, the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt, which reached 7.1% of GDP in 2001 – and is estimated as 4% of GDP in 2002 – meant that the evolution of the debt ratio does not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administrations, the achievement of increasingly high primary surpluses or the growth in GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the evolution of public debt, as laid out in the Greek stability programme in 2002, has been partially affected by the review of the statistical methods used in different financial operations. That review was carried out in accordance with the system established by Eurostat in order to comply with the conditions set in the ESA 95, in our European system of national accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistical review which was carried out in 2002 led to an increase in Greece’s debt ratio in 2001, which rose to 7% of GDP higher than the figure previously estimated. Bearing in mind the new budgetary perspective arising from this review, the updated stability programme foresees a reduction in the debt ratio equivalent to 1.7% in 2002, forecasting an acceleration of this reduction after 2003, with a reduction of approximately 0.4% until the end of 2006. In fact, from 2003, the modification of the debt ratio will correspond better to the level of primary surplus.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Commission’s economic forecasts of last autumn, Greece’s ratio of debt should decrease until the end of 2004, although at a slower rate than that forecast in the 2002 stability programme.</p>
<p class="contents">For the period following 2004, when the updated stabilisation programme allows a certain decrease in real production growth, it will be necessary to apply a credible strategy of budgetary adjustment in order to be able to guarantee this reduction in the debt ratio laid down in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the greater transparency of the public accounts achieved as a result of their recent review has increased their credibility and also that of the strategy of budgetary adjustment, laid out in general terms in Greece’s stability programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Transfer of profits from Central Bank to State Treasury</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 17 May 2001, the Swedish Parliament decided that the Central Bank should pay an extra SEK 20 billion to the Swedish Treasury this year in addition to its normal payment of SEK 8.2 billion from its profits, which naturally broadened the scope for reorganising the national budget. A similar transfer was made the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">Would this type of transfer from the Central Bank to the Treasury have been possible if Sweden had been taking part fully in the third stage of EMU at that time? </p>

<p class="contents">It should be observed that the comments of the Commission contained in its report stress the absence of detailed legislation on the financial transfers of the Central Bank to the Swedish Treasury, particularly in relation to the allocation of extraordinary benefits and payments. That legislation should establish the rules and conditions for the carrying out of such transfers and should guarantee that the Riksbank conserves the financial resources necessary to comply with its obligations within the framework of the European central banks system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of such rules, there is no adequate guarantee of the independence of the Central Bank and particularly its financial independence. It should also be observed that the relevant requirements within the framework of the Treaty appear in Article 108 – the independence of the Central Bank – and in Article 109 – the compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty.

I interpret the answer as saying that the Commission cannot accept, or considers incompatible with membership of the third stage of EMU, a situation in which large funds are transferred from the Swedish Central Bank’s profits to the Swedish Treasury, as has been done by the Swedish Government. We are talking here about a total of SEK 40 billion over two years. I would ask you to confirm that this is a correct interpretation of what you have just said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The levels of exploitation perpetrated by those companies is totally unacceptable. The current fall in prices now affecting those rural growers is leading to economic disaster: 100 m coffee growers, who were earlier persuaded to cultivate this export crop, are now going hungry.

I think we are all aware of the impact of these price changes on coffee-growers, which, as we have known for a long time, is only one stage of a general problem, namely the dependency of poor countries on a few basic products. We have carefully noted the figures sent to us by Oxfam, which address in particular this vast difference between the retail price in supermarkets and the sum paid to growers. We have not assessed all this and we are not in a position to say whether the trade margins applied by one company or another are reasonable, taking account of processing costs, transport costs and retailers’ profit margins, amongst other factors.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, if non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam consider, for example, that the practices of certain companies might need to be subjected to an enquiry pursuant to competition rules – I am referring here to the European Union – they should provide us with the necessary evidence so that we can proceed as we normally do in this type of case.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the cause of this collapse? It is quite simply a considerable imbalance between supply and demand. What can we do? It is a complex, multi-faceted issue. We can, for example, help those who have invested in fair trade and are thereby trying to help producers in the poorest countries to obtain a higher proportion of the price paid by the end consumer. In the Commission, we already help, support and fund various actions in this field. We support, and I do so within the context of trade policy, projects aimed, for example, at the adoption of codes of conduct or social labels. In this way, if I may say so, we support all those who have invested in fair trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, however, diversification is probably the key that will make it possible to reduce dependency and vulnerability among these countries and peoples in the face of fluctuations in basic products. That is part of an integrated approach between development policy and trade policy, on which, as you know, we have already been working for several years, with Mr Nielson. We are trying to achieve better coordination of the various instruments available to us. For example, we began with the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, which allows a number of countries among the poorest in the world to diversify their exports. This is a policy that we have, if I may say so, supported and passed on, moreover, to various international organisations such as the World Bank. We are also working along these lines in applying the Cotonou Agreement. In addition, we have supported, within the International Coffee Organization, all the actions undertaken to improve quality and set minimum quality standards, thereby removing the poorest quality coffees from the coffee market, since these, as we know, have also had an adverse effect on prices.</p>
<p class="contents">More simply, we are currently working with a number of NGOs and Oxfam, in particular. We have made contact with the main coffee merchants and we are in contact with a number of distributors. We are open to constructive ideas on this matter, which, I repeat, is complex. In any case, that is an example that should give pause for thought to those who advocate the total liberalisation of all agricultural markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These economic partnership agreements are part of an initial discussion stage. They logically follow what was agreed at Cotonou and we are trying to ensure that our ACP interlocutors reorganise themselves into sufficiently large groups to remedy the current situation. This situation, roughly speaking, is as follows: we gave them – or granted them, as we used to say – significant trade preferences, which, moreover, are causing problems for other countries as we have seen within the WTO, and they are not taking enough advantage of these preferences. We must therefore change this.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this process, therefore, what is guiding us is the development aspect and we clearly intend, in this matter, to make trade considerations dependent on developmental considerations, taking account of the fact that this is our priority with the ACP countries as a whole. I would therefore reassure Mrs Kinnock on this point, if that is needed. It is not that businessmen hungry for access to extraordinarily attractive markets have taken control of these negotiations. The negotiations continue to follow the lines of what was agreed with Parliament and with the Council, in other words prioritising development.</p>
<p class="contents">It should, however, be recognised – and it may well be that Mrs Kinnock’s question reflects this – that many ACP representatives still have reservations with regard to these negotiations on regional economic partnership agreements. Many ACP countries are indeed asking us questions, for example on the degree of liberalisation or reciprocity we intend to achieve, as if that were the main objective of these agreements. I will repeat, as many times as necessary, that the main objective of these agreements is not to open up the ACP markets further to Community products.</p>
<p class="contents">These economic partnership agreements are not, to our minds, simply free-trade zones that are nothing more than instruments for trade. We want to make this a business, a process, a partnership to serve the development of these countries themselves, in particular in allowing us to address the problem of the many internal barriers to trade that still exist both in Africa and in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and also in allowing us to address the restrictions affecting the competitiveness of these regions, in order to turn them into poles of economic development. We have also launched relevant studies on this point – we call them impact and sustainability assessments – to analyse the social, economic and environmental effects of these agreements which – I would remind you – are, first and foremost, agreements between these countries themselves, and we shall ensure that the results of these studies are taken into consideration throughout the negotiations. I would also point out that we have made available to the ACP countries the financial resources necessary to enable them to carry out their own analyses and acquire the necessary technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where we are up to in the negotiation process, which is in its initial stage, which we would like to extend to a second stage from September this year. We have established various contacts with various ACP regions and we all know that some of them are more prepared to liase with us than others. As far as they are concerned, they have choices to make within the ACP group. We do not intend, and I do not intend, to make these choices for them. We shall liase with them when they are ready and those that are ready first will begin discussions with us when they decide to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want to go into detail here, but I know some regions within the ACP group that are ready to start negotiations tomorrow. The objective of these negotiations must be sufficiently clear in their minds if this does not pose a problem for them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the title, I find ‘economic partnership agreement’ perfectly appropriate. It means that these are not only trade and free-trade agreements between the EU and the ACP countries, but also economic partnership agreements with the main aim, and I insist on this point, of leading the member countries of the ACP group to conclude trade agreements with each other in terms of investment, intellectual property, transport, infrastructure management and laying down standards, in order to establish economically-relevant zones themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Is development the objective of these negotiations? Yes, of course, but development cannot be negotiated, whereas trade can. That is why we are introducing certain elements of trade negotiations, while keeping development as our objective and starting, as I said earlier, from a simple observation on which I believe you will agree with the Commission: the situation we have experienced for 20 years, based on granting unilateral preferences to these countries, is not, for a number of reasons, bringing about the transformation of this trade liberalisation, which we decided unilaterally, into a genuine instrument for development. The relationship between trade and development is not that simple: in particular, the ACP countries must work together to create markets that are large enough to interest investors.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I assure you, this is a trade negotiation in which our objective is to make a better, more active contribution to development in these countries than we have in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In response to requests from Thailand and the Philippines to be granted preferential access to the EU for their canned tuna, the WTO Deputy Director-General submitted recommendations in December 2002. If agreed and implemented by the EU, the recommendations will cause serious prejudice to the export of canned tuna of the ACP States and the Andean Pact countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that the provision of any preferential access to Thailand and the Philippines will displace ACP and Andean Pact countries' imports into the EU, thereby threatening the livelihoods of poor fishermen and EU investments in the ACP States with whom the EU has concluded 16 bilateral fishing agreements to access fishing resources in their waters? Can the Commission confirm that it will not accede to the recommendations of the WTO mediator, but will instead examine the whole issue in the context of the ongoing WTO Doha round where a more balanced result can be achieved to the satisfaction of all the parties? </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span>, Mr President, Mr Howitt’s question refers to the commitment made by the Commission at the time of the Doha negotiations to examine a request that was very firmly presented to us by Thailand and the Philippines concerning the pricing system applicable to imports of canned tuna from the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Very roughly, in summary, we apply to the ACP countries preferences that are not applied to Thailand and the Philippines, and these two countries considered it appropriate, at a time when we were trying to obtain WTO agreement for a general derogation concerning all these preferences, to make their own agreement conditional upon negotiations with us.</p>
<p class="contents">We accepted this request, mainly for the benefit of the ACP countries since their preferential system with us could only be validated by the WTO if we accepted the request. We undertook to hold discussions with Thailand and the Philippines and, if necessary, to enter into a mediation procedure. I repeat, to make this very clear, that, without this discussion/mediation procedure, the WTO derogation concerning the Cotonou Agreement would not have been obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore went ahead with these discussions with Thailand and the Philippines in December 2001, January last year and spring last year. They did not lead to an agreement. The demands regarding access to our market made by these countries seemed excessive to us at the time, and the offers we made seemed insufficient to them at the time. We all, therefore, asked the World Trade Organisation for mediation last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">In December, the mediator ruled and recommended that the Community open up a quota of 25 000 tonnes of canned tuna at an import duty rate of 12%, given that the normal rate, if I may say so, is 24% and the ACP rate is 0%. So, ACP 0%, normal rate 24%, mediator’s proposal 25 000 tonnes at 12%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in favour of the adoption of these recommendations. We feel this is a matter of credibility and trust, and a way to manage our relations with a number of trade partners within the WTO mechanism. We believe that recourse to mediation in this type of case is an honest procedure, that, in a way, it places on an equal footing mammoths such as the European Union and smaller creatures such as Thailand or the Philippines, and that this is part of our way of viewing our trade relations with a number of countries, in particular developing world countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have analysed the mediator’s recommendations and our analysis is that the quota of 25 000 tonnes in question will not have a significant impact on imports from the ACP countries or on imports from other countries which also benefit from generalised preferences. I am thinking in particular of a number of Latin American countries. This quota would represent approximately 9% of total imports of canned tuna in the Union and 4% of the total consumption of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Community imports of canned tuna from the ACP countries have undergone a significant rise over the past few years. They currently represent approximately 60% of global imports and, given the very close, and often very welcome links between the industry in the ACP countries and certain sectors of the Community industry, we do not consider that imports from the ACP countries are seriously threatened by this mediation. That is why we are supporting it and we have proposed the adoption of the mediator’s opinion in the Council of Ministers. Depending on the result of this consultation, we will shortly present a draft regulation to implement this quota. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have three supplementary questions. Firstly, although he was admirably clear, it would be clearer to us and to everyone if we knew the timetable for agreement in the Council of Ministers and what will happen if there is no agreement by qualified majority voting. In relation to that, he kindly invited me and others to his Conference on Impact Assessment last week. It was an extremely good conference, but a single statement will not have a major impact on the ACP. It will need some backing up. With Senegal responsible for 8 000 tonnes of imports and Ivory Coast 41 000 tonnes, the ACP believe they can be very seriously affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the earlier answer to a question from my colleague, Mrs Kinnock, about our obligations under the Cotonou Agreement to extend market access for ACP countries in terms of the trade negotiations, does this not fly in the face of those promises and call into question our commitment to development in those countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are currently in contact with our Member States on a technical level. I believe we shall achieve the necessary qualified majority. If that were not the case, I would have to decide whether or not to take it further. That happens from time to time. It is a question of credibility for us. The ACP countries were well aware, when we were together at Doha, why and how this derogation had to be obtained in order to cover our preference system, including on delicate issues such as bananas. They are therefore fully informed of this. Everything took place transparently. Neither the Philippines nor Thailand have hidden their aim in this matter from the ACP countries, namely to benefit from a market share that they feel should logically be theirs. Therefore, nobody was taken by surprise, and when we agree to mediation, we should – I believe that is the rule of the game – accept the results.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact on trade with the ACP countries, the reason why we consider that the impact would be minor is that this concerns canned tuna and, as you are no doubt aware, there is a slight difference between canned tuna and tuna not in cans: it lies in the industrial process, which takes place in networks and according to methods that closely involve our Community industry. We feel that some water will have passed under the bridge before the Philippines or Thailand obtain this kind of comparative advantage, and therefore there is no serious threat in this respect. That said, if any of the ACP countries wishes to discuss these technical aspects with us, we are fully prepared to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third question: does this involve a derogation, a change from the market access commitments we made with regard to the ACP countries? No, of course not. This is not a change. It in no way alters the preferences. Quite simply, let us not forget that, had we not accepted this way of working with Thailand and the Philippines, the Union’s entire system of trade preference regarding the ACP countries would have suffered. That is what is behind this matter, and we should all remember this in order to evaluate fairly the results that are on the table today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In assessing the impact of the proposal, it is also necessary to take into account the substantial degree of flexibility offered by the proposed directive. Exemptions from the principle of non-discrimination are possible. These include exemptions, for objective reasons, on the basis of collective agreements, and in cases of agency workers with open-ended contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">These exemptions and derogations are particularly important given the current heterogeneity of the sector. The flexibility and diversity they offer make it impossible to come up with simplistic conclusions regarding the possible cost and benefits of the directive. Despite these difficulties, the Commission has carried out a qualitative analysis of the possible impact of the Directive, based on all available information. The following conclusions are very important in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the whole, the actual changes required by the directive should be very limited because it mostly codifies rules which are already common practice and are enshrined in national legislation, collective agreements or codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even in cases where some changes may be required, the actual effect will be mitigated by the flexibility offered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, any cost induced by the directive would therefore remain very limited, and the proposed directive will be an important factor in the creation of an appropriate legal framework for the continued expansion of the agency sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission considers that the proposal will help to realise the full employment potential of the sector in Europe. It will improve the social acceptance of temporary agency work and will make it more attractive. This point has also been underlined by the CIETT in its own study. The availability, in particular, of workers with higher qualifications and more diversified skills will encourage more enterprises to employ temporary workers. This will allow agencies to recruit their workers from a larger pool of candidates and to expand into new areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the United Kingdom, it is important to mention the regulatory impact assessment by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK. It estimates that the directive will have a positive effect on total employment and on temporary agency workers' productivity. It also recognises that it could result in greater job security for agency workers and an increase in the attractiveness of agency work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to put to her that in the real world, a Confederation of British Industry survey of over 200 companies in the United Kingdom, which has more temporary agency workers than any other country, indicates that her directive will result in 60% of these companies employing fewer temporary workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to put to her the results of that survey which show that 40% of people entering temporary work come from the pool of long-term unemployed and 40% get permanent jobs within a year. I would like her to tell me how her position on this directive and those findings square with the report from the Commission and the report that has just come out and which states that 'without additional efforts, the Union looks set to miss its employment rate target for 2005'. I must point out to her that the UK already meets the 70% employment rate target.</p>
<p class="contents">How can her stance on this directive, and its practical application among businesses that employ temporary workers, in any way be squared with the target to reduce unemployment across the European Union? It simply does not make sense. As the Commissioner for Employment she must take notice of what people are telling her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not true that Great Britain has more temporary workers than any other country. It has 3.2%, compared with 4.6% in Holland, 2.5% in France and far fewer in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular market, the agency work sector, is a law unto itself, but we can see from our analysis of each country that, in countries such as Holland which use exactly the same system as in the directive, not only are there no problems; the sector is becoming more and more dynamic. In the United States of America, it is highly profitable and attracts a great deal of investment. So we have a model that does not increase payment costs. There is no interference whatsoever on our part in workers' take-home pay; all we are doing is securing their minimum rights and we can see that, so far, this model has been a success in the two countries in Europe which have applied it.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative intervention affects a very small number of workers at present – 1.5% throughout Europe. However, what is important is that it introduces a framework which secures minimum workers' rights for the future development of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Our research shows that this sector has a very poor reputation in the labour market because often the workers used do not enjoy even basic rights; they have no protection, they have no pension rights and they have no insurance rights. If minimum rights – no more and no less – were protected, it would become a dynamic sector. That is the view taken by Confederation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning, the CIETT has surveyed these agencies, which believe that a broad legislative framework will give better results and enlarge the market. I can even quote figures to support this:</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent CIETΤ study concluded that, with the right legislative framework and with basic insurance for workers, these agencies could be employing 6.5 million people by 2010. That represents an increase of 4 million people. I repeat, I shall be using the assessment by the agencies themselves, not just the Commission's assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My information is that the temporary work sector in the Netherlands has declined since their domestic law changed.

<p class="contents">You referred to a cost in Great Britain which, of course, I can neither corroborate nor assess at this point in time; I imagine you are referring to the cost of insuring these people. And, of course, I cannot argue, I cannot talk about no insurance, about no pension rights or any such contributions that have to be paid. But apart from that, as far as payment is concerned, the directive does not interfere at all, it does not call for any sort of equivalence, except where the worker replacing the person off work has exactly the same qualifications, exactly the same seniority and exactly the same number of years' experience. Only then does it call for identical working conditions and this, of course, is highly complicated. However, I am more than willing to discuss the individual elements with any agency at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Sweden, the number of people written off sick has soared in recent years and there are also signs of a disturbing trend in other Member States. At the same time, the birth rate in Europe is at a record low. Over the next 50 years, therefore, the population in Germany, Italy and France, for example, will decrease dramatically. An ageing population creates a strain on the economy to provide pensions and a social safety net. The EU summit held in Stockholm in March 2001 identified the demographic challenge as one of the Union's priorities for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons can be drawn from this serious trend and what initiatives has the Commission taken to foster a more integrated view of family formation, childbirth, the demographic challenge, rising numbers of sick notes and sustainable pension schemes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, any demographic policy has to be a combination of individual policies and economic and social incentives, most of which come under the Member States and their jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on European added value in this sector, given that the demographic problem is a problem which besets each individual country and Europe as a whole, where the population is both ageing and falling in numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two parts to this problem. First, the population is ageing and has a longer life expectancy; that people are living longer is a good thing and is due to better living conditions and medical care, but it calls for special policies to manage this ageing population. In this sector, the sector of the ageing population, the European Union has important policies on public spending and on how to improve public spending and link it to health care, pensions and, of course, employment policies. I would remind you here that the open method of coordination on employment, on poverty and exclusion programmes and on pensions is geared towards older workers; this is one of its basic lines of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of policies is designed to reinforce the family so that people can have more children, given that numerous countries have a very low birth rate. It includes legislation, especially legislation to support parents with young children and basically help them reconcile working and family life, policies on gender equality and women’s access to the job market – remember families often have serious financial problems – and of course social policies, especially social infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Social infrastructures are the responsibility of the Member States, but I would remind you that, first, they receive a great deal of funding under the Community Support Framework in connection with employment and, secondly, the first specific targets were set in Barcelona a year ago, when all the Member States undertook to provide 95% of children between the age of 3 and 6 with a place in a state or private nursery by 2010. This will do a great deal to help families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, Mr Maroni has announced that a law which has just entered into force will provide incentives for young couples. I tell my pensioners to do what they can to increase the number of babies born too, and they have assured me that they will do their best. The question I would like to put to you now is as follows. Do you think that just increasing the birth rate will be enough to resolve the problem of pensions and the huge number of elderly people, or is it not equally important to create new jobs? As long as there are unemployed people, the existence of more young people will not solve the problem of the elderly: there will just be an ever-increasing number of young people who are unemployed, who are unable to pay for the pensions of the elderly.

All I need say is that, even if the birth rate increases significantly in Europe and even if the number of immigrants doubles, Europe’s population will still not stabilise and its numbers will continue to fall. Consequently, the demographic problem really is a burning issue for governments; as far as the labour market is concerned, a larger population obviously also makes for a more dynamic economy. The example of the United States, where the population is expanding fast as immigrants integrate, is an important example.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is vital for us to realise that the situation as it is today will create serious problems on the existing job market, where we look set to have a shortage of workers under 30 from 2030 onwards. Consequently, irrespective of how intensively we need to act on the problem of employment, and you are quite right that we need to create more and more jobs, we also need to act directly to increase the population of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been listening to the debate on the television in my office and I heard your answers to my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to follow up on Mr Fatuzzo's question because it is in my report on information and communication technology and its impact on SMEs. I hope you will agree with one of the recommendations I made in the report, which is that there are many older people who have retired at 55-plus who would be delighted to return to employment if there was some financial incentive for them to do so. Information and communication technology is an area where we could use them, if there were financial incentives to train them. Afterwards, if they were working, it would be important not to tax them on their income because they have a pension as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This would have two impacts. Firstly, it would allow older people to work and still use their skills. Therefore their disposable incomes would have an impact on rural economies because they would tend to spend that income. Secondly, we would not be so dependent on imported labour. Obviously a high birth rate is a good thing, but it would take years before this was reflected in the labour force. My recommendation would provide a quick solution. I should like to hear the Commissioner's view on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The figures are indeed worrying. Only 37% of people over 55 are still in work in Europe. Early retirement has been used as a restructuring mechanism in most countries for years now. It has put a large number of people out of work and of course, as the information society restructures, older workers are the first to go. When we analyse pension systems and their problems, we generally talk of the need to increase the retirement age. This is an economic approach which numerous countries need to take; at the same time, however, we cannot increase the retirement age unless there are specific policies and incentives, as you said, for these people to enter the labour market, which is why, at European level at least, one of the main priorities in our Employment Strategy and in our recent review of this strategy has been the over-55s.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Barcelona target, every country undertook to have 50% of the over-55s in work by 2010. Every country also undertook to include a percentage of over-55s in training and in training and lifelong learning policy; in other words, there will be incentives in the form of tax relief or subsidies to encourage these people to go back to work.</p>
