The European Union will be represented by the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission. High Representative and Vice-President Ashton will attend, as will Commissioner De Gucht.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit has been carefully prepared by the External Action Service working in close cooperation with the Commission and the two Presidents, preparations built on the debates held in the European Council and the Council, on Russia as a Strategic Partner in late 2010 and in January 2011, on the results of the previous EU-Russia Summit, and the visit by the Russian Government to the Commission in February.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years. We have concluded bilateral negotiations on Russian WTO accession, agreed on the approach towards a possible future visa-waiver regime, and agreed the Partnership for Modernisation, which is now in its implementation phase.</p>
<p class="contents">Work is also ongoing in the regular framework of the Four Common Spaces and all its technical dialogues. Our interaction is quite intense. Let me remind you that Russia is the only external partner with whom the European Union holds two annual summits. The visit by Prime Minister Putin and an unprecedentedly large Russian Government delegation to the Commission on 24 February was a clear sign of Russian determination to seek closer relations and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, many significant bilateral issues remain unresolved. Of particular concern is the situation regarding democratic development and human rights in Russia. In the context of upcoming Duma and Presidential elections, the standards of the electoral process will receive particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to turn your attention to our main objectives for the summit, which are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">First: the European Union will strive to encourage Russia to resolve the last remaining outstanding multilateral issues to facilitate WTO accession before the end of 2011, building on the EU-Russia bilateral agreement reached in 2004 and last December. Russia can still achieve WTO accession before the end of 2011 if it can take the necessary decisions to resolve the handful of outstanding issues at multilateral level. The summit cannot replace negotiations in Geneva, but it can urge Russia to take constructive action.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the European Union will impress upon Russia that more progress needs to be made on agreeing substantial trade and investment provisions, including on energy, in the new EU-Russia Agreement in order to provide a solid legal basis for deepened economic cooperation in the years to come. We do not rule out bringing the issue of Russia’s unjustified ban on European Union vegetable imports to summit level, although we hope that scientific evidence will allow a quick solution at an expert level.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: we shall maintain top-level support for the Partnership for Modernisation as an important vehicle for Russian commitments to reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: we will promote human rights and the rule of law in Russia, and</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, we will encourage Russia to deepen cooperation in our common neighbourhood and continue the dialogue on other topical international issues like the Middle East, for example, or North Africa. In fact, progress on Moldova/Transnistria will serve as an important test case for closer foreign policy cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should also use the summit to reconfirm our political commitment to make progress on crisis management cooperation – provided our decision-making autonomy is in no way affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy also figures prominently in our dealings with Moscow. We will emphasise the need for further reforms in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field. We will also underline the need to cooperate on fighting climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">To pursue our goals of highest standards on nuclear safety, we interact with Russia both at the bilateral level and in multilateral fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the G8.</p>
<p class="contents">We will repeat our invitation to Russia to engage in negotiations on a comprehensive Euratom-Russia agreement which should promote the highest standards for nuclear safety. With regard to the Fukushima accident, the European Union will push for equivalence of approaches regarding stress tests for both existing and planned nuclear power plants.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but certainly not least, we have engaged in a clear process on visa-free travel. The European Union has prepared and agreed in March its proposal for the list of common steps towards the possible establishment of a visa-free travel regime, and we have indeed started negotiations in April. Since then, a Permanent Partnership Council on Justice and Home Affairs has been held and clear progress has been made. But negotiations on our common steps at expert level are, to date, not finished. We must be clear at the summit that there are no political short-cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Russia is concerned, its main objectives for the summit can be expected to focus on visas, the WTO, energy – including nuclear safety – and security cooperation. Russia might come back to the idea of a new Political and Security Committee at ministerial level. We believe that necessary cooperation structures are in place; what we need is political will to make progress on substance.</p>

I will not say anything more about the points which the Commissioner has mentioned because they are covered in the resolution. As far as the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the final declaration of the summit next week must be more than just fine words. Russia is our great neighbour; Russia is an important partner. We are mutually dependent and the level of that dependence is great, so now we are expecting real agreements that will lead to results.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our priorities? First of all, the Partnership Agreement. We need to set the negotiations in motion. I expect that the EU will persuade President Medvedev to grant his negotiating team full powers to undertake specific commitments. It is high time that we got things moving again on the trade and investment dossier. The negotiations on the energy chapter are also behind schedule. We need agreements on a solid and transparent energy partnership and one which is based on rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to hear where we stand on the human rights paragraph. For us, for Parliament, this is a vital part of the partnership. I see the modernisation pact as a complementary issue, in the same way that the common areas are. This is a secondary matter, but it would help if we got the WTO rules through. That would help to establish a level playing field while facilitating the investment climate.</p>
<p class="contents">President Medvedev is personally involved in improving the rule of law, but this is not enough, as you have just said yourself. We need to be certain that, in the upcoming elections, Russia is going to live up to the obligations it has undertaken under the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The elections will be the acid test. That, then, also means that new parties must be allowed to register. Russia should feel honoured that election observers have been called in well in advance. Lastly, the import ban on European vegetables (...)</p>

I hope that the negotiations will not take too long. Unfortunately, however, they will not be completed as fast as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten imagines. During the process, we need to have a dialogue both with the official elected representatives and with the representatives of civil society, who are often closer to us on matters of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a Partnership for Modernisation between the European Union and Russia is a good one. However, Russia also needs to play its part. We need more democracy and less corruption. We still hear many investors complaining of legal uncertainty, particularly as regards taxes. Above all – as the Commissioner has already mentioned – we need to prepare speedily for Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WTO membership. In the area of energy policy, we need Russia to be obliged to acknowledge the principles of a transparent and fair energy policy. There is a lot that Russia can do itself, particularly as regards energy efficiency, where there remain many shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">Also as regards energy, I would like to bring up something that concerns its neighbour – indeed our common neighbour – Ukraine. Right now, Russia is once again attempting to use the issue of energy and energy prices as a political weapon. We must absolutely reject that. We are committed to the freedom of Ukraine to decide in which markets it wishes to be present and where it wishes to operate. We do, after all, want to have trade relations and a trade agreement with Ukraine. Russia should not put pressure on Ukraine in this area by giving it the option of either joining the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus or paying a high energy price. That is something we reject.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, as regards neighbours, we also expect Russia to adhere to the agreements in the treaties in respect of Georgia and to withdraw its troops back to those areas where they were present before the conflict. We also hope that Russia will make a positive contribution to resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. On both sides, here it is not a matter of supplying arms, but rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has already mentioned the importance of visa liberalisation. It is particularly important for relations between individuals that people enjoy as much freedom of movement as possible between Russia and the European Union. I hope that we will soon make some progress on this.</p>
<p class="contents">One crucial issue, however, will be how the next elections are held. Russia needs to be aware that the world, and the democratic world in Europe in particular, will be watching closely to see how these elections are carried out; whether the parties are registered correctly and fairly; and also whether certain individuals or certain parties are excluded from the elections at the outset. That is something that should be made clear to Russia at the summit. We want to see proper, fair elections in Russia too.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia still has a lot of catching up to do in terms of its economy. However, Russia is ready for democracy. We want to see democracy in Russia, just as much as the citizens of Russia want this themselves. That is our desire and our vision. Russia needs to realise that democracy will be good for Russia too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the EU and Russia must keep in mind that a true partnership can only be a straightforward relationship. On behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to invite the representatives of the EU to address all the concerns raised by the European Parliament with their Russian counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will face major difficulties in relations with Russia unless the two partners rely on the same values and principles. If the Kremlin moves even further away from democracy and the rule of law, Russia will lose all legitimacy as a partner to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Kremlin has prevented a number of political parties from registering for the State Duma elections on procedural grounds, and the list is likely to be extended to include the People’s Freedom Party led by Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Milov, Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov. The surging suppression of the opposition must be brought up at the summit and the opposition parties must be allowed to register.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is not China. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE; therefore, she must uphold her international commitments and obligations. Furthermore, Russia must abide by her own constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours. We insist that she stops pressuring Ukraine – as my colleague said just now – for example, as Prime Minister Putin did yesterday when he met the Prime Minister of Ukraine, pressing them to join the customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. We cannot accept this. We expect Russia to withdraw its troops immediately from Georgia to the pre-conflict positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the ALDE Group is very disappointed that, on the eve of the summit, Russia has imposed a disproportional import ban on vegetables from the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs, from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet. I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant, Muammar Gaddafi, to leave power. I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics, some of which are now – thankfully – gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU. However, the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine, and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations. In this regard, I hope that the Vice-President/High Representative will raise the issue of Georgia, parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers, and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova. I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months, which is a good idea and the way forward.</p>

That is also something we will have to talk about in Nizhny Novgorod. More important, however, are the political germs, or seeds, that are actually present – the weak beginnings of democracy and the rule of law. On these aspects, we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop.</p>
<p class="contents">President Medvedev has acknowledged that economical and technical modernisation cannot be achieved without a fundamental modernisation of society. Yet so far, we have seen little in the way of action to accompany these fine words. The representatives of the EU should therefore make it abundantly clear to President Medvedev that the forthcoming elections to the Duma are a test of the credibility of his reform policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine and proper elections form part of the foundations of democracy. Anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the earliest stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair elections start with allowing the registration of parties. Regrettably, early indications suggest that the Russian leadership has learnt nothing from the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that there were no grounds for dissolving the Republican Party and apparently does not wish to allow the newly established People’s Freedom Party to be registered.</p>
<p class="contents">More Kremlin-backed parties and an All-Russia People’s Front initiated by Prime Minister Putin are merely leading us down a political blind alley. This semblance of competition has led the country into political apathy and devalued the Duma. President Medvedev could bring about a breakthrough here and end his Presidency with at least one demonstrable success.</p>
<p class="contents">In the particular cases of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Magnitsky, rather than waiting for a ruling from Strasbourg, the judicial arbitrariness should be brought to an end. The review of these cases by the Fedotov commission is a good first step. Its results and conclusions should be published as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The future participation of the Civil Society Forum established recently in Prague should be an important topic for discussion during the talks and negotiations between the EU and Russia. After all, events in North Africa demonstrate that for effective reform, you need an active civil society. The Russian Government should therefore work to bring this about in its own country and endeavour to achieve a partnership for modernisation with civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the topic was not even included on the agenda of the plenary at the beginning of last week. This all smacks of bad planning, and it is now a formality, in my opinion. Moreover, instead of striving, through a principled process, for a new agreement on relations with Russia, which we recognise as an important partner, we are notoriously repeating proclamations and demands which clearly have no hope of succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, first and foremost, build on the issues where progress can be achieved. An example is the progress over agreements on the planned easing and possible final removal of the mutual visa arrangements with Russia. Instead of this, we are criticising the position of Russia in the case of imports of vegetables from the EU. How does our own behaviour appear, however, from outside the Union? When looking for the source of the deadly bacteria, and in the absence of hard evidence, we accuse each other, restrict imports and exports of commodities and claim compensation. We can surely draw our own conclusions as to the level of confidence we are inspiring, and not just in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So we are, once again, beginning to be concerned that we will again be more dependent on Russia in the future. However, I would like to remind you that the coin has another side. Russia is just as dependent on the European Union, because they sell most of their products to us. If we do not buy their energy products, then the Russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case whether we like it or not. We must make this partnership a positive and constructive one. That is why we need to make progress on the Partnership Agreement and on visa facilitation, to add substance to the Partnership for Modernisation, in order to work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to realise, however, that this gives rise to obligations on both sides, including in respect of membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in that you cannot just continue doing as you like; rather, these agreed contractual or international rules are binding on everyone and there is no place for arbitrariness in reciprocal dealings. This also precludes using energy as a political weapon, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">These mutual interests must be handled positively and constructively, and where external policy is concerned, this naturally also means that Russia must take on some responsibility. At the moment, there is the case of Syria in the United Nations Security Council. In such cases, Russia must make a constructive contribution to the creation of a peaceful international community. This also means, however, accepting the sovereign rights of neighbouring states and their decisions as regards entering into the alliances that they wish to enter into. Moreover, Russia must make a positive contribution in the case of ‘frozen conflicts’ and must now bring to an end the unlawful circumstances in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a shared responsibility in the global world. It is clear that Russia and the European Union have substantial mutual interests in this global order, and in defining these interests, we must ensure that Russia recognises that democracy and the rule of law are also crucial for internal development. A degree of conditionality is called for not just in relations with us alone; a country in which there is no rule of law is also not a good place to invest, because there is no legal certainty. A country without democracy and the rule of law cannot really make progress in the long term for the benefit of its own citizens. Let us hope that the Partnership for Modernisation and other matters will help us to find a common and positive way forward here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia is indeed at an important crossroads. Its internal political situation will be determined by the elections to the Duma in December and the question of who will continue the modernisation embarked upon as president from 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">One can also put a positive slant on this. There could be no better opportunity to strengthen international confidence in Russia’s development. This is conditional upon there being fair elections, fair opportunities for registration and access to the media for the candidates, to ensure at least an element of equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the Partnership for Modernisation between the EU and Russia. This opens up new opportunities for effective cooperation. We should therefore not miss the opportunity to support Russia vigorously in this modernisation – not just by investing in the modernisation of the economy, but also in its society. Governments put things down on paper and, as we all know, you can say what you like on paper. Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity. We can only successfully support such modernisation, however, if people can come together easily in order to learn from each other and exchange experiences. For these reasons, the EU and Russia should finally reach agreement on the common steps that need to be taken to achieve visa-free travel and how these can be implemented, in order to achieve results as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking about people in the Kaliningrad region and thinking about facilitation. A month ago, this House decided that visa facilitation should be allowed for cultural purposes. We have been talking about whether perhaps particular consideration should be given to young people here. These are all good suggestions to get the ball rolling, but they are no substitute for an overall solution. I would therefore urge the Commission to step up the pace. You can count on our support in any case, including as regards some of the more hesitant certain Member States.</p>

We have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then. We alternate between cooperation and confrontation with Russia. Where the neighbourhood is concerned, we deplore the war with Georgia, the pressure brought to bear on Ukraine, the recognition of President Lukashenko in Belarus and the split in the Republic of Moldova as a result of the conflict in Transnistria. At the same time, our cooperation with Russia in the Security Council on the issue of Libya or on Iran’s nuclear programme is pleasing.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation. Yet what is modernity without democracy? In the list of priorities that you have just given, Commissioner Füle, human rights came after cucumbers and the rule of law after tomatoes. Is that the best we can expect in this area? Do we expect nothing more of Russia’s democratisation? I believe that as Parliament, we must make it clear that we do expect something; for example, fair elections – there must be progress there.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, though, one thing that I would like to say quite clearly: such progress is often to be achieved at expert level. Two summits a year is too much. Let us have one summit, as we do with America. We have enough exchange with Russia in the specialist areas. Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia is pursuing a strategic goal of bringing individual countries under its control by exploiting the issue of gas when conducting foreign policy. Just in the last few days, the Russian authorities have used blackmail to put pressure on Ukraine, making changes in gas prices dependent on the country joining the Russian customs union or a merger between Gazprom and Naftogaz. The above actions quite obviously put an end to discussions on the creation of an EU-Ukraine free trade area. Long-term agreements on gas supplies are also a way of influencing the policies of EU Member States. We should therefore commend the position of the European Commission, which has acknowledged that the agreement concluded by the Polish Government does not comply with EU law. Prices for Russian gas in Central Europe are already almost twice as high as those offered to Western European countries. Russia’s discrediting of shale gas extraction projects is causing additional alarm.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights problem is most apparent in the Khodorkovsky case. There can be no question that this issue must be raised during the summit, in view of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Human Rights on the unlawfulness of the arrest and detention of the Russian businessman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But we should indeed call for what you have termed deep democracy, and we have to work seriously to support civil society in Russia. I would like to highlight some points in the joint resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow. We underline the need to maintain close contacts and support programmes for the development of civil society in Russia. I would like to inform you, Commissioner, that today there is very worrying news from Nizhny Novgorod, where the summit will be just starting.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been informed by civil society organisations there that pre-emptive measures have been taken by the law enforcement agencies. Attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the EU representatives, and this is completely unacceptable. Even people who work on children’s rights have been warned not to go to Nizhny Novgorod. The credit cards of the main local organiser of the civil society event – which is, by the way, the first ever linked to an EU-Russia Summit – have been blocked (for technical reasons, of course), and her car licence plates have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations.

<p class="contents">There are also problems, however, in the area of the still unimplemented agreement from 2006 in respect of EU airlines.

If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia, then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly, give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists, or which exists as far as Russia is concerned.

I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours’ policies. This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine, where Mr Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations. This is nothing short of blackmail. If the contract is not renegotiated, gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m<span class="sup">3</span>. Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas, although it is closest to the sources of this gas.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine. I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine, given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country’s entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area, and will, in the near future, engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union. I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Major changes have occurred in the world since the last one. Let me mention among them, firstly, the Arab revolutions, a process of deep transformation which affects virtually the whole Arab world. The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant reshaped the future of nuclear power, especially with regard to safety. Climate change has brought more and more dangerous consequences. Osama is dead but terrorism is alive and has targeted innocent people all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of events is long and all of them concern both the EU and Russia, two neighbouring global players with predominantly similar or complementary long-term interests. Their relations can only be further developed if they are based on mutual respect, openness and transparency. Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy, these relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Parliament have always been clear about the expectations of European citizens. Now, with regard to the upcoming summit, I would like to highlight four issues. First of all, the summit should bring decisive progress on all the remaining obstacles related to Russia’s accession to the WTO. This important step will create better opportunities for the business communities on both sides and will further liberalise trade and economic relations globally. In this respect, the application of protectionist measures is counterproductive and we hope they will not be hidden behind overplayed health threats, which is, in our opinion, the recent case with the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the road map for visa-free travelling announced in May will accelerate further visa facilitation and will bring closer the moment when the visa regime between the EU and Russia will be fully liberalised. To this end, Parliament expects that some politically sensitive issues will be properly addressed by the Russian authorities, in particular, by stopping the issuing of Russian passports to the residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a more constructive engagement of Russia in our efforts to support democratisation, economic and social progress and stability in the six countries in the Eastern Partnership. The last two years have clearly shown that this EU initiative is not aimed at competition, but rather at cooperation with Russia, since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the EU and Russia. In this respect, we urge Russia to intensify its efforts in facilitating the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Transnistria and in the more and more worrying Nagorno-Karabakh region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that the EU and Russia should fully cooperate in the revision and elaboration of higher standards for nuclear power safety, following the events in Japan. We expect that higher standards are kept, not only in the newly built, but also in the already operational, nuclear power plants. I hope that this issue can be part of the discussions in Nizhny Novgorod. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year’s Partnership for Modernisation. As the Commissioner said, the last two years have seen improvements. The agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these. Progress this month in solving the Transnistria conflict would be another positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky/Lebedev judgment, and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions, real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business, which are too often absent in Russia. A structured civil society dialogue would help; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust. But the Russian bear still has a sore head and I advise the Commission to carry to Nizhny Novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore delighted that, in your speech, you did not forget to mention the importance of abolishing the visa requirement with Russia, as relations between partners must be built on trust and openness. We should tell Russia clearly and seriously what the timetable is for abolishing visas, and what conditions must therefore be fulfilled.</p>

I trust that this EU-Russia Summit will firmly address the very harmful and utterly disproportionate import ban on our European vegetables. The market gardening sector expects this ban to be lifted and deserves to see that happen. Commissioner Füle, can you confirm that the EU delegation will fully commit itself to resolving this situation in Nizhny Novgorod? This is a very important question and one that I get asked a lot in my country at the moment when I talk about the EU-Russia Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to say a few words, in particular, about the problematic accession of Russia to the WTO. Just one more brief question. Georgia has, in fact, played a key role here. Georgia has <span class="italic">de facto </span>the right of veto. President Saakashvili is raising the stakes. What he wants are transparent borders – he basically wants Abkhazia and South Ossetia back – and he has, of course, also put the import ban on Georgian wines and mineral water on the agenda. However, Russia does not seem to be budging at all. In brief, is it not the case that we have deadlock on our hands here? It very much looks like it. Besides, the Russian economy, which is mainly driven by oil and gas, does not really need accession to the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that respect for human rights is a valuable basis, without which a strategic partnership and the modernisation of EU-Russian relations would be impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific case we need to discuss is the ruling by Moscow city court on 24 May to reject the appeal made by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev against the new seven year sentence. In the 21st century, a shameful trial is taking place before our very eyes, and the sentences are not written in court. This is happening in a country linked to the EU by a so-called strategic partnership. The ruling by the Moscow court once again revealed serious flaws in Russia’s court system and strengthened the opinion that it punishes those in Russia who have political ambitions, but whose opinions do not coincide with those of the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The ruling made on 31 May by the European Court of Human Rights and violations in Russia of the European Convention on Human Rights are facts that must also be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the European Parliament should say clearly that, if Russia’s President, Dmitri Medvedev, wants to come to the European Parliament, he should appear here together with prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and this would be the most effective strategy and tactic for the modernisation of Russia. President Medvedev and prisoner of conscience, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, together in the European Parliament – that would be a sight worth not only the attention of the world’s media, but also the heartfelt support of democratic society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We expect Brussels to send Russia a strong signal about the elections respecting democratic standards, which would safeguard diversity of opinion in the Duma. The question of nuclear safety is particularly relevant following Fukushima. I am pleased that the Member of the Commission mentioned that this issue will be raised at the summit and that there will be a call for the highest international safety standards in nuclear power plants already operating and those that are planned, in both Russia, and of course, the European Union.</p>

A convergence of positions would help to open the prison gates for those who recently stood in the Belarusian elections and would stop blatant human rights abuses.

So far, unfortunately, there is no real progress. Analysts conclude that the priority of the current Russian élites is to keep the present system in place, trying not to allow external relations to have any impact on the domestic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore up to the EU to make one issue very clear. The success of the Partnership for Modernisation will be dependent on the Russian Government’s willingness and capacity to provide for a truly independent judiciary and to implement the basic principles of the rule of law, transparency and reciprocity. If the EU will not address this crucial issue in a principled manner, hardly any progress can be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span> writes: ‘Russia can’t have a modern economy until it has a genuine rule of law’. The summit venue will be Nizhny Novgorod, in Soviet times, Gorky, where the key figure of Soviet conscience, Andrei Sakharov, was banished for many years. I call upon the Commission and our negotiators to follow the spirit of Andrei Sakharov and to remember the message of Sakharov Prize winner, Sergei Kovalev, in this hemicycle two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the EU should stimulate and help Russia to come to terms with its totalitarian legacy. After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power. I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era.

<p class="contents">Russia certainly has no right to a sphere of influence. All former Soviet republics have the right to decide freely where they wish to belong.

<p class="contents">If we adopted a different approach to Russia along these lines, we might harbour the hidden hope that democratic processes would be liberated to a far greater extent in Russia, with a certainty and confidence that can then feed into European politics.

This is a justified demand because we cannot allow for the agreement to be a collection of general phrases. The European Union and Russia are mutually dependent. The European market is no less important to Russia than Russian gas is to us, and Russian economic modernisation plans are directly dependent on our technology and expertise. That is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law. The European Union is Russia’s largest trading partner and main investor; that is why the new agreement must contain legally binding terms regarding investment. It is important to insist on the elimination of unilateral and unreasonable trade barriers. This relates to the Russia – Kazakhstan – Belarus customs union, as well as to the current embargo on European Union vegetables. Russia cannot be allowed to continue using energy policy to implement its geopolitical interests, by discriminating against certain Member States, for example in the field of gas tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in continuing to work on the visa-free zone with Russia, we must also work on establishing a visa-free zone with the rest of our Eastern Partnership states. At the summit, we must reiterate that the six-point agreement on Georgia has still not been implemented. Taking into account the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, the restrictions placed on opposition members regarding registration for the elections and on appearing in the mass media must be removed. We have already affirmed our willingness to be present in all phases of the election process, yet Russia must show willingness to accept long-term observers, as well as to actually implement fair elections. In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that these critical remarks are not in any way directed against Russia or its people, but the opposite – they are directed against the current government, in order to improve the situation in Russia and make our cooperation more fruitful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask you to raise this issue. This also involves relations between Russia and its neighbours, and Russia’s ‘sphere of influence’. Since you are conducting relations with Ukraine so very successfully, I would urge you to make it very clear that an association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine will also be beneficial to Russia, and that we are very alarmed at the manifestations of extremely forceful political pressure being brought to bear on Ukraine on the eve of the conclusion of negotiations, while these negotiations are in their final stages. Please make this very clear to the Russian side on our behalf.

The days of the Hitler-Stalin pact are long gone and in a democratic world, we should be practising a kind of European Monroe Doctrine; in other words, that the fate and the policies of Europe are decided by Europeans. That does not mean that we do not want a policy of good neighbourliness and dialogue. Yet Nizhny Novgorod – the venue for our meeting – should also serve as a warning, because it reminds us of the famous story of the merchants of Nizhny Novgorod who believed that they could buy their freedom and their security and were then hanged.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to realise that we cannot buy security with money or by glossing over reality; it is only obtainable through honest partnership. We need a common foreign affairs and security policy. We need energy independence and energy security and less dependence on Russian energy policy, which is still being used for foreign policy purposes. We also need to speak clearly on human rights. We cannot afford to compromise here. Where Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev are concerned, I would state that these individuals must at last be freed – otherwise the state visit by the Russian President to the European Parliament will take place under a huge cloud.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to have a partnership with a Russia that is in the process of democratising, but to do that, Russia must democratise – in reality and not just in our wishful thinking. That is why I think Mr Swoboda is right: the forthcoming elections will be decisive. Then we will see whether our partnership with the Russian people – of whom we are very fond – can be expanded into a genuine partnership with the Russian state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For several months, Russia has been conducting a very intensive campaign aimed at obtaining exemptions for its gas infrastructure from the rules set out in the third energy package, or, in other words, the rules of our anti-monopoly law, which prohibit the simultaneous and parallel control of energy resources and transmission networks. Mr Shmatko, the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Kramer, CEO of the South Stream project, and Mr Miller, CEO of Gazprom, have made visits to Brussels in connection with this matter. This is a major campaign. The European Union’s position on this matter must be set out very clearly to Russia, namely, that we do not intend to grant reduced tariffs to Russia; instead, what matters to us is that the gas market in Central Europe becomes more competitive and less monopolised. Commissioner, I would ask you to tell us plainly whether the European Commission is prepared to make statements to this effect during the summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the context of the latter event, it is very important to emphasise the definition of the word ‘diversification’, which in Europe is often synonymous with the construction of a large number of different gas pipelines from Russia. Diversification is taken to mean the construction of the South and Nord Stream gas pipelines, for example. Meanwhile, the European Union should concentrate on guaranteeing gas supplies from non-Russian sources: it should do more to promote the Nabucco pipeline from Azerbaijan, and it should invest in gas terminals and research into extracting shale gas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that pressure continues to be put upon the Russian authorities at various levels to improve the human rights situation in Russia. Apart from discussion in the framework of the EU-Russia summits, we should ensure that the consultations which take place twice yearly with European Union representatives and diplomats from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are decisively stepped up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask everyone to remember that we have been dealing for many months with a very far-reaching political crisis there, and that for at least several months, we have been dealing with a far-reaching economic crisis. We are also dealing with a situation in which Russia is putting pressure on Belarus, probably a great deal more forcefully and effectively than it currently is on Ukraine. Russia is effectively attempting to take over the entire economy, or rather strategic sectors of the economy, by taking advantage of the dramatic situation in which the Belarusian economy finds itself. I have one request. If Russia decides to provide aid, and we know that it has decided to provide aid to Belarus, the European Union should ensure that Russia makes this aid dependent on the observance of human rights. These are common values that we apparently share with Russia, a fact which is often repeated by the Russians, and so they should help us to introduce these values in Belarus. Otherwise, by funding the Lukashenko regime, we will be responsible for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to call on Commissioner Füle, and on Commissioner Oettinger, to provide the European Parliament with information regarding the progress of the talks and the outcome of this group’s negotiations. We would also like a list of the members of the negotiating group. I learnt from a representative of a Russian energy concern that the company would be participating in these negotiations. I would like to know whether this is true, and whether the representatives of large companies will take part in negotiations on the Russian side.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with competition law in the field of energy, without the granting of any exemptions, is also a very important matter for the European Parliament. During the recent presentations of South Stream investment plans in Brussels, it was apparent that Russia and Gazprom want privileges and a special status.

Sometimes, that can be difficult – particularly, I suppose, when it comes to Russia, because it has a very chequered history. Even since the fall of the Iron Curtain over 20 years ago, its behaviour towards some countries, particularly neighbours such as Georgia, certainly cannot be admired.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, any negotiations with Russia have to be underpinned by a recognition of the important values of respect for human rights and respect for neighbours. Nevertheless, they do offer a great opportunity for tackling global issues like climate change and also, of course, a great opportunity to develop both our economies. Russia is a rising country and a developing country in terms of wealth. Certainly, if the fundamentals are right, there are great opportunities both for the European Union and for Russia in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have heard many of you calling for continuing engagement with Russia, calling for the relationship and coordination with the Russian Federation to be further developed, but I also heard calls for more democracy and less corruption. I also heard a call for no harassment, which was reported in Nizhny Novgorod, although I respect the role of the Russian Federation in ensuring security for the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen that we have convergent views on many subjects. We agree on the key importance of our relations with Russia both bilaterally and in multilateral contexts, whether regional or global. We agree that it is a multifaceted relationship in which economic, social and environmental issues, human rights and rule of law, security aspects and political cooperation are all of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not expect a resolution of all pending problems at this summit – and yes, we will raise the issue of vegetables. But we should aim to make significant progress in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on some of these areas. First: elections. The Russian authorities are well aware that the European Union will be following the 2011 and 2012 electoral processes very closely. Should there be irregularities in the upcoming elections, these issues would have to be addressed. Right now, we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections, and to cooperate well with ODIHR to ensure appropriate monitoring. We will place a special emphasis on the issue of the registration of new parties and access to the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: I took note of Parliament’s concerns with regard to the human rights situation in Russia; we share most of them and these issues will be raised with the Russian President at the summit. The main forum for addressing human rights and rule-of-law issues is the European Union-Russia human rights consultations. This is an important instrument and its potential should be fully used. Unfortunately, this is not yet the case and the European Union will therefore stress the need to have an honest and useful dialogue for which a review of the consultations’ modalities is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: the Partnership for Modernisation. I fully agree with the honourable Members that the Partnership for Modernisation should be broadly based. The coordinators will present in Nizhny Novgorod the second programme report on the implementation of the partnership and, as you will see, the rule of law is at the very core of this initiative and we have concrete projects in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Point four: Russia is the neighbour of our neighbours, and I think Nizhny Novgorod would be an excellent opportunity to refer to the recently adopted ENP review document and, with reference to this document, to make sure that we are transparent in our policy vis-à-vis the neighbours we share with Russia. This is an opportunity – based <span class="italic">inter alia </span>on that transparency – to make our point that caring about the well-being of the neighbours we share is a win-win process. I think it will also be a good opportunity, based on some new ideas in that ENP review, to talk about a strengthened cooperation to address the protracted conflicts in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Point five: the question of energy cooperation will be addressed at the summit. We need transparent, fair and competitive energy relations and we will raise our concerns with the Russian President. We will emphasise the need for further reforms, as I stressed in my opening remarks, in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, honourable Members, the European Union and Russia are partners. Partners should talk to each other frequently, they should try to achieve consensus where possible, but should not hesitate to openly address more problematic aspects. We have talked about some of these problematic aspects today. They should be addressed at the summit and, wherever possible, we should look for solutions or at least improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned the ENP review. I strongly believe that one of the added values of that reviewed Neighbourhood Policy is that the universally applicable values and principles reflected there are not only applicable to small and medium-sized neighbouring countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
