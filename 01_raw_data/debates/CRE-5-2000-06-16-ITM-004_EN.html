<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferri (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, having seen Directive 98/71/EC on the legal protection of designs, we are now being called upon to assess the proposed regulation and to decide whether to adopt it. Of course, the regulation follows the same line as the directive, and it therefore contains all the same strengths and weaknesses as the directive on such a contentious, competitive issue where there are a large number of interests at play. In the end, the directive did not deal with the issue of spare parts for the purpose of repair. I am referring to the famous repair clause, the spare parts clause: the complex, organic world of the automotive industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee took great care over its work – and I would especially like to thank its chairperson – although a more conservative, extremely cautious interpretation prevailed in the end, for we did not want to push the boat out too far, since the directive will be supplemented on the basis of three years’ monitoring of the use of spare parts for the purpose of repair. However, one of the strengths of the regulation lies in its definition of the Community right for products and designs and registered and unregistered products: the proposal to use the central Community trade mark office for design as well, offers an exclusive right to protected use at Community level, with some exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a step towards meeting the clear fundamental requirement of the single market and towards common rules on invalidity, surrender of rights and possibilities of use, particularly in two very important areas: novelty, which is connected to disclosure, and individuality of character, which is connected to creativity. These are two aspects of a fascinating world, which clearly requires protection, but also requires flexibility. This is why I insist, in particular, on a minimal package of amendments which, in the balance of protections between the Community right and copyright – I urge the European Parliament to give an up-to-date and, most importantly, realistic evaluation of the highly complex world of designs –will prevent the persistence of monopolies. I would therefore advocate that a ceiling of 25 years for the protection of registered design rights would be quite sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the directive is not open to subjective interpretation. The directive states that the Member States must be able to strike a balance between the Community right and copyright. I would point out that copyrights last for as long as 70 years in a number of States. Thus, if we were to add the 25 years to the 70 years, we would end up preventing the modification of a common product which often – and also, so to speak, by its very nature and taking into account novelty and creativity – cannot last very long, not beyond the lifetime of a human being, for example, and therefore a ceiling of 25 years would seem reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">May I insist, therefore, that at least this type of adaptation to requirements is implemented and that the Community of Europe, the single market, is given access to a world which is so important, particularly for the SMEs where, in effect, the productivity of design and creativity – which for the European countries naturally represents a boost for jobs and employment – fits perfectly into this network of rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, even with the limits and constraints which I have stressed, in order to give the Members a balanced view, this proposed regulation, which introduces a standardised system with standardised protection throughout Community territory can, in effect, be an important milestone in the construction of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Palacio Vallelersundi (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I should firstly like to refer to the almost herculean, not to mention highly commendable, work carried out by the rapporteur that has, above all, highlighted concerns for small and medium-sized companies that really form the focus of this reform.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has accused me, with his usual goodwill, of taking a more conservative and cautious stance on this issue. I do share his concerns, particularly the one he expressed in Amendment No 13. However, the problem we face involves a highly complex network in which laws from 15 different national origins are interwoven, and harmonising such laws is not something we can fully hope to achieve overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Ferri’s concerns – some of which I do not personally share but have defended as a member of the Group of the European People’s Party – will come to the fore in the next few years and I should like to assure him of our support since he has been proved absolutely right on many of the issues he has defended in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the regulation, the first point I should like to make is that it derives from the 1993 Directive. It is high time this regulation came into being: we cannot delay it any longer. Its passage has been hindered, among other things, by a famous ruling of the Court of Justice which requires a change to the legal basis, and the complexities in the repair clause relating to the spare parts for complex products which the rapporteur mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore firstly like to urge the Commission – and I think I speak for both the European People’s Party and Parliament here – to do everything in its power to enable the Council to adopt this regulation and do so as soon as possible. This is because, I am proud to say, the amendments endorsed by Parliament – without wishing to undermine the rapporteur’s explanations – significantly improve the quality of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often in Parliament we produce texts that are, for complex political reasons, both obscure and of reprehensible quality. Generally speaking, these amendments considerably enhance the text and I believe the Commission will adopt them without any problem.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the more important amendments in my view is Amendment No 16, which provides that, in certain cases, if the ground for invalidation of a design obtains only in respect of one or some Member States, invalidity shall be declared only in respect of such a Member State or States. This could lead to the paradoxical situation in which a Community design could be invalid in fourteen Member States and valid only in one.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall stop on that note, Mr President, as it is Friday, but I think the message is clear. I hope that the Commission adopts the majority of our amendments and proceeds to approve the regulation quickly so that it takes effect as soon as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The large amount of time spent on this regulation was justified on the grounds of the importance of adopting the directive on drawings and models, a job that took most of the previous legislature and part of the present one.</p>
<p class="contents">It was clear that once the more serious problems relating to the text of the directive had been overcome – a directive that can be considered as balanced – the task of establishing a resolution would be far easier and so it has been. The whole process proves that Parliament was right to adopt the approach in creating the directive first, followed by the resolution. Its decision to intervene to obtain the freeze compromise in drawing up the resolution, with the directive being subject to the codecision procedure, was decisive. What is more, this perhaps would not have been the case had the procedure been the other way round, i.e. first the regulation followed by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Had this been the case, Parliament’s role would not have been as decisive and the balance between car manufacturers’ interests on one hand and independent body part manufacturers on the other would not have been achieved. The same can be said of the interests of consumers and insurance companies. The fact that this agreement – which is far from perfect, but which provided a way out of the impasse in such a contentious issue – was reached, made the task of creating this regulation and this report on the Commission’s proposal far easier.</p>
<p class="contents">This task basically involved incorporating the compromises reached in relation to the directive in the regulation. If the European Union intended to announce laws regarding the harmonisation of Member States’ legislation, it was only right that its own laws were in line with the laws on harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission’s proposal followed the wording of the directive almost to the letter, it received our support. On this basis, the majority of the amendments we endorse consist precisely in enhancing the similarities between the directive and the regulation. I should like to thank Mr Ferri for his report and, at the same time, welcome the flexible approach he adopted throughout proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s first report did advocate certain proposals which, though he believed them to be correct, in the opinion –and I believe in the better informed opinion – of many groups in Parliament, contradicted the freeze compromise relating to the repair clause. However, by adopting this flexible approach, Mr Ferri saw fit to withdraw his proposals and I thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree. The first relates to the definition of the individual character of the design, which incorporates an element that supposedly brings it into line with the TRIP agreements. This is neither the time nor the place to begin a debate on this issue. We do not agree with this interpretation and would go as far to suggest that the amendment in question includes certain distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of contention relates to copyright and we shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I announced during the Internal Market Council on 16 March last, I intend, before long, to submit a new amended proposal for the regulation to the Commission for its approval. In this amended proposal, we will tackle the problems that have cropped up since the Commission submitted its proposal last June. The recommendations made in Mr Ferri’s report will prove extremely useful and significant in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to be able to inform you that the Commission supports the recommendations in the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18 and 20. However, some of the amendments, and particularly Amendments Nos 10, 11, 21, 22 and 23 are not entirely consistent with what was agreed within the context of the 1998 directive on design and so, unfortunately, the Commission is unable to accept them. At this juncture, I would point out that the Commission sets great store by the principle that the regulation must not deviate from the concepts laid down in the aforementioned directive.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like briefly to take up the matter of design protection in the use of component parts of complex products for repair purposes, which is the subject of proposed Amendments Nos 6 and 12. This matter, which we had lengthy and complex negotiations about during the conciliation procedure for the directive, found expression in the directive and in the approval of the ‘compromise’ over the freezing of the repair clause. In this context, and in accordance with the compromise that was reached when the directive was approved, the Commission undertook to investigate the matter further and put forward a proposal within the framework of the directive. So as not to anticipate the solution that is ultimately to be approved, the Commission stipulates in its proposal for the regulation that component parts within the framework of the Community system are not protected, at least not as long as there has been no agreement on a definitive solution. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is amenable to Parliament’s suggestion that the text of the regulation should be brought more into line with that of the directive and you have my word that the Commission will give this further thought.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to make reference to Amendments Nos 15 and 19, about counterfeiting. As far as Amendment No 15 is concerned, the Commission sees eye to eye with Parliament on the need for a right to information. However, the Commission would prefer to deal with this matter as part of the fight against counterfeiting and piracy. I should point out, in this connection, that the Commission raises this issue in the Green Paper on combating counterfeiting and piracy in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the matter of compulsory transfer of ownership of infringing products to the holder of the design, as proposed in Amendment No 19, the Commission takes the view that this may not be a fitting solution in all cases, particularly as it may be troublesome to the holder of the design in certain cases. Therefore, also because Article 93, paragraph 1, makes it possible, under point D of the regulation, for the national courts to take such measures where necessary, the Commission does not support the proposed amendment.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to thank the Members of this House for their support and cooperation in respect of this important regulation. I hope and trust that the European business community will welcome the fact that it is soon to have at its disposal one simple and inexpensive procedure for the protection of industrial designs in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it is urgently needed. I abstained because I am disappointed that the Design Office is to come under the Trade Mark Office, and that we are not going to take advantage of the opportunity to devise a different language regime.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The language regime of the Trade Mark Office was explicitly chosen in the old 1993 proposal for a regulation. It has been done very much on the quiet in the proposal we are dealing with now. I hope that the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are fully aware of this, as well as all the others who are prepared to take this aspect of the regulation on board without demur.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Naturally the office must be able to operate efficiently and cost-effectively. Rapid decision-making is a legitimate aim. There is no need to translate every last piece of paper.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not asking too much to want the conciliation procedure and correspondence with the Office, as well as the application for registration, to take place in the citizen’s own language. When the Trade Mark Office was first set up, a discriminatory language regime was adopted under the guise of a technical solution. Now we are repeating past bad practice. What then, is the point of having an article in a Treaty that entitles the citizen to use their own language when in contact with this institution? As far as I am concerned, that is good reason to make a stand against this sequence of events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
