An important part of policing involves guaranteeing the safety of citizens as a fundamental principle of living together in freedom. The dramatic increase in the range of activities within contemporary societies has however led to a need for additional security and control services for goods and persons. These may be provided by either natural or by legal persons. It has proved necessary for states to respond to this situation and find a way of integrating private security operationally into the monopoly rightly held by the state, given that this is a complementary activity which comes under the public security service.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union have adopted a series of legislative measures to establish administrative controls. These differ from state to state. Freedom, security and justice must be guaranteed by the states. It is for each one to guarantee the safety of its citizens. With this in mind, the creation of a single market and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice are bound to mean that it is necessary to harmonise private security services within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no easy task, however. Research has shown that a number of obstacles must be overcome. Firstly, national legislation in this field varies considerably. Secondly, there are significant legal barriers between Member States restricting or preventing the free provision of services in the private security sector. Thirdly, essential features of the various national regulations pertaining to the sector must be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">These therefore are the problems making it imperative for the Member States of the European Union to harmonise their legislation regarding the private security sector. Only then will the free provision of services across a European area of freedom, security and justice be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I am bound to request the House to support the report of the Committee on Freedoms in tomorrow’s vote. The report calls on the Council to withdraw the initiative in question. This is not because it is inappropriate, but because the legal form chosen is a decision, and also because of the legal basis chosen by the current Spanish Presidency to regulate the matter. That basis is Article 29(a) and Article 30(1) of the Treaty of the European Union. Both Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and I myself at the Committee on Freedoms have already stated the need to establish whether the activity to be regulated under the draft initiative presented by Spain is within the competence of the Community or that of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to draw your attention to three rulings by the Court of Justice against Spain, Belgium and Italy, on the grounds that they had retained in their legislation a number of conditions relating to the provision of services in the private security industry. This contravened the principle of non-discrimination provided for in the Treaty of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am against the provision of private security services being part of a public service. The Court of Justice has ruled to this effect also. Consequently, as regards the free movement of workers, the exception concerning posts in the public services Article 39(4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community does not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I believe that the activities of private security services do not amount to exercising official authority. It is my view that when such services act in support of the public security services they do so merely in an auxiliary capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress also that the private security sector is an economic activity, as the Court of Justice has confirmed. All legislative arrangements governing its activity in the Member States must therefore be subject to the Community’s provisions aimed at establishing a single market and eliminating internal borders within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be pointed out that to date, the Community has not adopted a directive aimed at regulating the private security sector. Nonetheless, this should not present an obstacle to future harmonisation of this sector. As rapporteur, I am therefore of the view that if the present draft decision were adopted, it would contravene Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union. The latter requires the Union to respect the Community’s competence to act within the scope granted to it under the Treaty establishing the European Community, and prevents the Union from legislating within that scope.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative is certainly pertinent and worthwhile. Nonetheless, for the reasons cited, I propose that its content be reconsidered. I further propose that pursuant to Article 208 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Council should request the Commission to undertake a study of what should be involved in a common action in the sector of legal or natural persons providing private security services. If appropriate, the adoption of the necessary provisions should be proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I therefore propose that the draft decision submitted by the Kingdom of Spain be rejected. It is not legally possible to regulate what falls within the scope of the first pillar of the Treaty establishing the European Community from the scope of application of the third pillar, regulated by the Treaty of the European Union. To do so would run counter to Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union, amongst others.</p>

<p class="contents">As we see it, this initiative is a victim of one of the teething troubles of the building of Europe, which is a tendency for bodies with more or less overlapping aims to proliferate. In this particular field we already have Europol, Eurojust, the European Police College, the operational Task Force of European Police Chiefs, the European crime prevention network and the European criminal law network. So this proposal, as presented to us, suggests an increasing lack of rationality and a growing incoherence of systems in a field of Community action which is in its infancy.</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that certain commendable objectives which deserve to be addressed and on which we should consider coordination and experience sharing by the police, and which have been touched upon by the Presidency, would be better served by amending the statutes and regulations of the European Police College, given that, if Spain were to fully participate in that mechanism that would also give an important boost to the coordination of police agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to identify what the new features are that would really bring added value and really represent gains in efficiency for the system, making it more coherent, setting aside changes that would result in a wasteful duplication of agencies, officials and costs, reflecting a certain bureaucratic tradition which does not serve our interests and which will not really assist EU action on crime. For these reasons, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs agreed to deliver a negative opinion in plenary on the adoption of this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seeks to institutionalise the provision of protection for public figures. The protection of public figures is, by definition, something which should be arranged between the Member States, or other states, and in the case of visitors, between the visiting state and the host state. I found it quite odd that there also it was based only on Article 29 of the Treaty of the European Union when it seems to me that both Articles 30(1) and 34(2)(c) needed to be added.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is the germ of a good idea here. So I have taken the proposal and amended it in such a way as to facilitate cooperation between national intelligence, police and security services without setting up a bureaucratic institution and with no further cost. One of the problems that I had with the proposal initially, was that it seemed to want to codify or create a tariff of protection. Therefore, someone like yourself, Mr President, of supreme importance in the affairs of the European Union, would no doubt have been provided with two armoured cars filled to the gunnels with armed policemen with machine-guns, whereas a mere humble back-bencher like myself would be lucky to see one policeman walk past his house every other day. This struck me as being a slightly odd idea because, if nothing else, it would provide an absolutely perfect guide to a would-be assassin, as to what he was likely to come up against. So I removed all that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is, as I still say, the essential point and what I have added to it is that there should be cooperation and some kind of harmonisation, not only of the protection that is afforded, but the response mechanism in the event of such a tragedy, or an attempt being made. There are a number of institutions ranging from the SAS in Britain through the German border guards, the excellent military police in Spain and Italy and other countries, who, since the tragic events of the Munich Olympics, have acquired a great expertise in the response. It seemed to me madness to leave the response element of this problem out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of shared information, I think that the information should be shared on a need-to-know basis and, above all, should be kept away from politicians, bureaucrats and even the people who are being protected themselves, because operational security in this area must be paramount. Nor should there be any extra levels of decision-making that could interfere with operational effectiveness. Knowing how long it sometimes takes for all the institutions of the Union to arrive at a decision, the thought of introducing another tier between the attempt on your life, Mr President, and the response by the policeman, and it would have to pass through several committees, I hope sends a shiver down your back.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the other important thing that I have added is that any sharing of information must be subject to the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is an area in which information would be shared on known threats, known possible suspects but, nevertheless, we have to make absolutely certain that fundamental rights are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I hope that the House will be sufficiently impressed to know that my amendments were the only ones that went before the Committee. They were passed unanimously without any votes against, which I understand may be a rare if not unique event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deprez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to reassure you that I will not need the full ten minutes that have been allocated to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the two reports that I have the honour of presenting to our Assembly today are very different in scope and nature even though they both deal with the same subject, namely Europol which, as we all know, is the European Police Office.</p>
<p class="contents">The first report was drawn up on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, and relates to the adjusting of the basic salary and allowances of Europol staff. The scope of the report is very limited and it obviously does not require very lengthy comment. Quite simply, I formally call on Parliament to reject this initiative for two fundamental reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I do not see why – and I hope that Parliament will support me on this point – Europol staff should be given a salary increase of 5.2% for the period 1 July 2001 to 1 July 2002, when, over the same period, European Union officials based in the Netherlands – in the same city of The Hague – will receive an increase in their salary and allowances of 4.3%. No serious or credible justification for this increase has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it is inconsistent and unacceptable for the Council to consult the European Parliament on such a routine issue, when it systematically refuses to do so on the Europol budget, despite the fact that both decisions fall under the procedure laid down in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union which stipulates that the European Parliament must be consulted. I therefore have no hesitation and no qualms in proposing that this initiative be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, deals with a different matter altogether. It has been drawn up on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Spain and proposes, in addition to a necessary change to Europol’s tasks, a new mechanism to amend the Europol Convention. As things currently stand, ladies and gentlemen, Europol is, as you know, an institution which comes under the umbrella of inter-governmental cooperation pure and simple. Within this framework, any change, however important or however urgent, to the Europol Convention requires ratification by all the Member States in accordance with the requirements of their respective constitutional rules. In other words, for example, it took no less than three good long years to ratify the Europol Convention. This procedure, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is obviously too lengthy, too slow and totally inadequate if we want Europol to have the capacity to take swift action against the manifold forms of serious crime. The initiative of the Kingdoms of Belgium and Spain, which proposes that the Council should from now on adopt further amendments to the Europol Convention, seems to be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, in my opinion and the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this initiative has three major shortcomings:</p>
<p class="contents">1. it restricts Europol, in law, within the ambit of simple intergovernmental cooperation, contrary to the express requests repeatedly submitted by the European Parliament and at a time when the European Council, at nearly all its meetings, is entrusting to Europol an increasing number of tasks to be carried out on behalf of the Union;</p>
<p class="contents">2. after enlargement of the Union, this decision may well cause excessive slowness, or even result in an impasse, in the decision-making procedure, given that the Convention stipulates and will continue to stipulate that all decisions relating to Europol must be taken by the Council acting unanimously. I ask my fellow Members how they think 27 Member States will be able to agree unanimously on operational police decisions, with crime levels as they stand in Europe and with serious crime spiralling out of control in certain sectors;</p>
<p class="contents">3. this proposal confirms the purely marginal role to be played by the European Parliament with regard to everything relating to Europol, while depriving it of the legal means and institutional framework which might enable it in the future to exercise genuine democratic control. I hope there are no objections regarding the fact that, thanks to the Convention, the national parliaments can now exert a degree of democratic control over Europol. Anyone who is familiar with the way Europol works and the way in which the national parliaments work is well aware that, at the moment, there is no proper or effective democratic control over Europol. The Council’s choice to propose a mechanism which possesses the major shortcomings that I have just mentioned is all the more incomprehensible, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Treaty provides for an alternative route which would provide a simple solution to the problems that I have just outlined. All we need to do is to use the provision which is formally enshrined in Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union as this would enable the Council to simply replace the Europol Convention with a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of this provision would have the direct effect of integrating Europol into the third pillar and, consequently, into Community legal order, with the following three considerable advantages in the short term:</p>
<p class="contents">1. the improvement of Europol’s operational capacities, since, pursuant to Article 34 of the EU Treaty, all decisions relating to Europol are to be adopted by the Council acting by a qualified majority with no derogation possible;</p>
<p class="contents">2. the improvement of parliamentary scrutiny of Europol, since, pursuant to Article 39 of the EU Treaty, the European Parliament should be consulted before the Council adopts any implementing measures and, secondly, Parliament may bring an action before the Court of Justice should these rights not be respected;</p>
<p class="contents">3. the automatic application of the rules governing the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to all the decisions adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 34 of the EU Treaty, something that Parliament has constantly called for.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this argument, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call on the House to reject the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Spain, due to its lack of operational and democratic substance. It is a bad day for the Kingdom of Spain! I also call on the House to approve the draft recommendation which seeks to transform the Europol Convention into a Council decision and to thus incorporate it into the institutional system of the European Union. I would like to point out to Mrs Frassoni in particular that, as far as I am concerned, this operation must only be a transitional phase, and preferably a short one at that, before integral communitarisation takes place, in other words, before the treaties are merged and the paralysing and archaic distinction between the three pillars is abolished. I hope that, in this area, the Convention will live up to the historical challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was responsible for this as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">This might appear to be a minor issue, almost a routine matter. As currently presented, however, it lacks the necessary rigour. Parliament already ruled on the appropriateness of including the Europol budget in the Community budget when called to do so in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol has indeed broadened the scope of its competence in recent years. This process has not, however, been accompanied by a change in its legal framework. Parliament has therefore been unable to exercise its function of democratic control. The decision on salary adjustment must be included in the scope of the budget. It so happens that this area, which does of course include the financial Rules, operates without Parliament having to rule on such matters. This is the background against which we have been consulted on the adjustment of salaries and allowances, pursuant to Article 44 of the present Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Deprez has already pointed out, the decision does not give the reason why the salary adjustment was set at 5.2%. The salary adjustment for Community officials in the Netherlands for the same period was 4.3%. This figure was based on statistics supplied by the OECD for all Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">True, Article 44 of the Convention does not link adjustment to a procedure similar to that applied to other officials. Nonetheless I believe such lack of justification is not in line with the principles of sound financial management applicable to the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative has therefore been rejected because of the lack of justification provided in the procedure adopted. The salary level of Europol officials is not at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we trust Europol will be strengthened and that it will fulfil its duties efficiently so that the citizens feel protected. This is all perfectly compatible however with the democratic control the House always insists on when the legal status of this instrument for police cooperation is debated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank the House for being able to address them at this point in the debate as I will have to leave for Rome to participate in the launch of a feasibility study on the external border guard. So let us say that I am allowed to speak because I have to leave for the front.</p>
<p class="contents">The five initiatives that were presented by the Member States have different scope but all relate to police cooperation. I will start with the initiatives concerning Europol. The first one, initiated by Belgium, aims to adjust the basic salaries and allowances of Europol staff. It is a formality since it results from the application of the Europol Regulation and the Commission has nothing against such an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second initiative of Belgium and Spain for a Council act drawing up a protocol amending the Europol Convention, this is a significant step to implement the provisions regarding Europol as laid down in Article 30(2) of the Treaty of the European Union, which, as you know, foresees Europol's participation in joint teams and the possibility to ask Member States to conduct and coordinate investigations. It also directly follows up to the Tampere Conclusions 43 and 45 on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore pleased that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of last April arrived at a political agreement on this part of the initiative while awaiting the opinion of Parliament. Regarding the part of the initiative on the simplification of the procedure for amending the Europol Convention, the Council is currently considering two different alternatives. The Commission's firm opinion, and there I follow Mr Deprez' arguments, is that the Europol Convention should be replaced by a Council decision pursuant to Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty of the European Union. On this point, the Commission fully agrees on the draft recommendations of Parliament on the future development of Europol and its formal integration into the institutional framework of the Union as introduced by Mr Deprez' report.</p>
<p class="contents">A Council decision will not only allow the amendment of articles of the convention through a simplified procedure but also the adoption of implementing measures with a qualified majority in accordance with Article 34(2). If Europol were to be established today, it would probably be based on a Council decision, this being the modern legal instrument. Furthermore, the legal basis of Europol will then be in line with the one chosen for Eurojust. Finally, a Council decision would bring the role of the Court of Justice into line with that which has been provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now comment on the draft recommendation. We are in full agreement with Recommendation No 6 on the cooperation with Eurojust and OLAF and with almost all of No 4 of the Recommendation regarding democratic control. Regarding the latter, I am pleased that Parliament agrees with what the Commission proposed in the communication that we have launched on the democratic control of Europol. We have some misgivings with the proposal to have representatives of Parliament on Europol's management board. I believe there are alternative forms of parliamentary control that are more appropriate to the specific nature of Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Recommendation No 2 on the budget, the Commission feels, as it has explained in the communication that I have mentioned above, that the question of Community financing should be settled in the context of Europol's possible future operational competences. As regards Recommendation No 3, the tasks, we can agree with everything except the first two points: participation in joint teams and asking Member States to open investigations. From a Commission perspective, these latter two points are superfluous since the Council arrived at political agreement on them last April.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the three initiatives submitted by the Spanish Presidency, I would like to express to the Spanish Presidency the Commission's gratitude for putting this subject on the agenda as they meet a real need for progress in police cooperation in the European Union. With respect to police studies, the Commission has on different occasions underlined its interest in advancing cooperation in an area in which knowledge at European level is often insufficient. At the same time, however, we have warned against a multiplication of networks, the functioning of which, according to the experience gained the European Police College may prove difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, therefore, suggested a more pragmatic formula proposing to amend the Council Decision of 22 December 2000 creating the European Police College to allow the police studies institutes of the Member States, where these institutes are separate from police training institutions, to participate as full members of the European Police College network. I am pleased that this suggestion, which is very much in line with the suggestion of Mr Sousa Pinto, has found an echo in a number of Member States and now seems to be the most favoured option in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the initiative for a Council decision setting up a network of contact points for national authorities with responsibility for private security, the Commission agrees that the growth of the private security sector in our countries, as well as in the candidate countries, requires a general policy discussion about division of responsibility between the public authorities and the private sector in providing security to our citizens. However, as much we would like to see a serious policy discussion taking place at European Union level on this subject, we must totally respect the division of competences established by the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has pointed out on several occasions that even though it would be positive to establish contacts between the responsible authorities dealing with private security in the Member States, it should be underlined that, according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, private security is a service as any other service. As such it falls within the remit of the European Community, as Mrs Cerdeira Morterero has just emphasised, and creating a network based on Title 6 would violate Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union, which states that "Nothing in this Treaty shall affect the Treaties establishing the European Communities or the subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying or supplementing them".</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore taken the necessary steps to proceed within the context of the first pillar to a study of the need for common measures to regulate the provision of security services by private providers in the European Union. In addition, the Commission would like to reiterate its argument on the inconvenience of creating another network with the administrative and budgetary consequences this implies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the proposal to set up a network for the protection of public figures, the Commission welcomes this initiative which identifies an area where the need for strengthened cooperation in the European Union has become evident. Although we must question the basic convenience of creating yet another network, it seems obvious that this initiative responds to a real need confirmed by experts in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point made by the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, and shared by the Commission, is that the network should not be competent to harmonise Member States legislation and regulations. The network should have no power of decision but should only function as an advisory body and should have not budgetary implications. There is only one caveat to the support by the Commission for this initiative and this is linked to the question of the Commission's participation in the network: we should be more involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like thank the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, whose work is a valuable contribution to this initiative as regards its legal basis but also as regards the added value this network will bring to police cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group’s position is in line with the conclusions of the Cerdeira and Sousa Pinto reports, insofar as we believe private security companies must be regulated at Community level. Given the size and activity of the sector across the Union, its activity should be regulated, as is recognised by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero in her report. I do however admit the validity of the arguments put forward in favour of reconsidering the initiative given the need to adjust it to its legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to setting up a European Institute of Police Studies, this ought surely to come within the scope of the European Police Academy, precisely because we should avoid creating a multiplicity of rival bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Both these initiatives do nonetheless demonstrate the Spanish Presidency’s emphasis on and commitment to achieving maximum efficiency from bodies established to guarantee the safety of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, European public opinion is becoming increasingly concerned not only about the rise in delinquency, but also about the increasing tendency to resort to street violence.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, mass events such as football matches or public demonstrations turn into pitched battles resulting in the destruction of street furniture and sometimes in personal injury. The demonstration may start out as legitimate and peaceful like those organised by anti-globalisation movements, but then things go wrong. The average citizen will not venture into certain areas of our big cities after dusk. The citizens are clearly concerned about the present lack of security and unhappy with the situation. This is why private security companies are flourishing and need to be regulated at European level. More thought should also be given to the relationship between public and private security. It does seem as if those who can pay for their security can be sure of it, and those who are not in a position to do so are at greater risk. In other words, those who have the money can buy the security the state is unable to guarantee. I do therefore believe that the issue should be dealt with in greater depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, street violence, cyber crime and child pornography are all new offences and involve a significant psychological element. This may possibly result from the dynamism and hyper development of a society with a great capacity for the transmission of information and communication, in which values such as safety, justice and urban peace have been sidelined in favour of misconstrued notions of modernism and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordinated police action is required if we are to rise to the challenges posed by these developments at European level, together with the swift implementation of initiatives designed to overcome them, such as the one before us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk a very great deal about this topic here in Parliament, and I believe we are agreed that Europol is an important department and one that it is right and proper that the European Union should have. It creates greater security for the public and can help us to contain cross-border forms of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">To guarantee that, we need good staff, who of course cost money. On that much we can agree. It is therefore somewhat painful for us to have to make clear our present position on the issue of employees' salaries. It really does sadden me that we at present have to resort to sanctions when it comes to officials' salaries. We do not actually want to get into a row with officials, and would much rather deal with the Council, but that is how things are at the moment with Parliament. The question has been put to us, and this is our answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand that structures be set up to facilitate the control of Europol by Parliament. This is something that the Council, in the long term, cannot ignore. To the Council, I say that its conduct in this matter will determine the extent to which the great majority in Parliament will cooperate with it. My group sees the strengthening of Parliament as one of the most important aspects of a future stable Europe. The success of enlargement is also dependent on Europe becoming more parliamentary. This is true in all areas, including internal affairs policy and internal security. We want not only to have co-decision when it comes to money; we want the shaping of internal affairs policy to start with Parliament, and budgetary law is part of that. Let me remind you, in this context, that we have hitherto been highly cooperative. The Council's post-11 September measures have our full support. We gave our full agreement to terrorism being combated without delay. Being convinced that it was right to do so, we also did not hesitate to join in drawing up lists of persons and groups whose assets were to be frozen. We have added essential aspects of counter-terrorism to our agenda, and that has been in cooperation with the Council and the Commission.</p>

None of this, though, seemed to have anything to do with Europol, an office whose tasks are decided on by the governments among themselves rather than by a majority in the Council, which is, by the way, itself not exactly the epitome of transparency and democracy. We, Europe's Parliament, are utterly excluded from any control or co-decision, and that is why I will say quite clearly, here and now, that it is a continuing scandal that the Member States' governments refuse to change this.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst democratic influence and control have been left out in the cold, though, Europol's competences have been extended, step by step, since 1998. Money-laundering and counter-terrorism were the watchwords when this was given renewed impetus in the aftermath of 11 September. Europol's functions are about to be extended again. It is already engaged in active preparations for enlargement. According to newspaper reports, new buildings have now been occupied at the Office's headquarters, and the first liaison officers from the candidate countries, for example Poland, have taken up their duties.</p>
<p class="contents">All these breathtaking changes are taking place without Parliament being granted even the slightest opportunity to obtain information and exercise control. It is unable either to demand a debate on the Office's annual report, or to summon its director before the competent Parliamentary committee. Parliament is not even accorded the right to send two representatives to its Board of Management. As directly elected delegates, we are left to rely on newspapers for our information, and that, Mr Deprez, is why my group supports your call for the Belgian and Spanish initiative to be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In February, Parliament was given quite strong support by the Commission on this issue. In its communication entitled ‘Democratic Control over Europol’, the Commission proposes to strengthen the European Parliament’s powers of control, but at the same time creates a diversion by referring to the creation of a joint committee consisting of members of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, an appealing reform by all appearances, but one that is in fact meaningless, since the proposed joint committee would have no power. In our view, in order to achieve coherence, the control of European police cooperation, such as that of national police forces, must instead be granted to the national parliaments. This control might well be organised under the inter-parliamentary pillar, the creation of which was proposed by the cross-party group SOS Démocratie to the Convention that is currently considering the future of the Union. I shall return to this point, Mr President, in my explanation of vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These initiatives may well be a good thing in themselves, but they are increasingly creating problems for us. The problems arise because they are founded on a legal basis which often turns out to be absolutely unusable and we are then consulted, even if we do not absolutely have to be, as with the salary rise for the employees of Europol. Let me say to the Council: Give them a decent income, so that Europol's staff are paid according to their performance, and so that they are motivated rather than frustrated.</p>
<p class="contents">You address problems, but end up proposing solutions that go against further integration. Here again, I am referring to the Europol Convention. We need quicker decisions, decisions reached by the Council on a majority basis. These initiatives create difficulties for us when more and more new institutions are created, meaning more bureaucracy and more expense, but nobody can explain to us what added value these new networks, institutions and facilities bring to the European Union or to security.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather, these initiatives give the impression that activities are being announced without any desire to strive towards real solutions. This plethora of initiatives increasingly clogs up our work in committee, with the result that tomorrow will probably see four of these five initiatives having to be rejected and one of them adopted only if amendments to it by Lord Stockton and others among us can actually be accepted. All in all, that does not make for a good day for this form of parliamentarianism or for initiatives of this kind. We have to consider whether future initiatives like these will require us, perhaps via the Convention, to take a new path in order to achieve sensible solutions in the interests of security and also of Parliament.</p>

However, the proposal appears to ignore a criminal challenge which is present in many European countries, a challenge of extreme criminal danger, namely the mafia: this is a challenge that must certainly not be disregarded by the European Parliament. I am afraid that it is something more than and different from what is defined in the proposal as just ‘organised crime’. The mafia is expanding increasingly beyond its traditional areas of activity, it is forging literally global alliances, it is penetrating the economic and financial sectors through extremely sophisticated money laundering systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives of the European Police College – which I propose should be named after Giovanni Falcone, who gave his life 10 years ago this year in the fight against the mafia and was the first to point out the transnational dimension of the tentacular mafia network<span class="bold"> –</span> must include precisely the fight against the mafia and prevention of the risk it represents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to drug trafficking and its initial powers, we have given it additional powers relating to trafficking in human beings, terrorism, money laundering, forging money and means of payment, as well as all kinds of serious international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to help transform Europol into a more efficient organisation for fighting against organised crime. The initiative before us today is intended to go further still, to revise the Europol Convention itself, which as it stands limits Europol's functions to collecting, analysing and exchanging data. We welcome the idea of giving Europol operational powers in line with our interpretation of the Treaty of Amsterdam. But we also wish to stress the need for this to go hand in hand with measures ensuring democratic scrutiny or judicial control.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure adopted for revising the convention is, however, of a strictly intergovernmental nature. We therefore support the proposal put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, that this initiative should be withdrawn and that a new proposal should be presented with a view to replacing the convention by means of a Council decision under Article 34, which would make it possible to integrate Europol into the third pillar and accordingly into the institutional framework of the European Union, as has been repeatedly requested by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What we wish to see in these parts of the area of freedom, security and justice are firm, specific and carefully considered measures. We reject initiatives which suggest that something is being done but which lack any real substance. That is why I support the Sousa Pinto report and am proposing that the Spanish initiative for the establishment of a European Institute of Police Studies, which would overlap with the structure already in place and in particular the European Police College, should be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support Mr Deprez's report on increasing the basic salaries of Europol staff: if the European Parliament is not consulted on Europol's general budget, it does not make sense for it to be consulted on a matter of detail. I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of incorporating Europol's budget into the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
