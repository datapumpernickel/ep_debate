<p class="contents">Lisbon and Barcelona have added a new dogma, a clarification of the doctrine, and point to reform as the only path to salvation, with salvation meaning closing the gap that separates us from the United States. The task of defending the dogma is entrusted to the European Central Bank – the defender of the faith on issues of monetary policy – although, in the fields of budgetary and macroeconomic policy, where the risk of dispersal is greater, it is difficult to know exactly who should play this role.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently witnessing a resurrection of misguided and perverse behaviour, and, what is even worse, the emergence of doctrines that seek to justify this kind of perversion; few in the field of monetary policy, but more in the fields of budgetary and macroeconomic policy. Document after document reaffirming these dogmas appear, but they lack coordination and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are tackling the reform of the Treaties, and now that the Convention is up and running, I would, therefore, say the same thing about these economic guidelines as about the employment guidelines: they should serve to share diagnoses, to establish clear codes of conduct and mechanisms for sanctions or penalties where misguided behaviour occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like – and Mrs Randzio-Plath will probably explain this to you – the Commission to continue to be the driving force, to continue to hold the monopoly of initiative and for the principle of qualified majority to be extended, together with that of codecision, to cover most macroeconomic areas. Mr Solbes is no mere altar boy; he is a high priest, and has a fundamental role – that of spearhead, like Saint Vicente Ferrer – in this process of reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to achieve full employment and raise the employment rate to the level of other regions of the world, we need growth over and above growth in productivity. We also need full employment to step up internal demand and to achieve gross income from the EU Member States. This is a prerequisite if we are to achieve sustainable growth at a high level over a substantial period, and a prerequisite that needs to be expressed more clearly in the broad guidelines for economic policies and which needs to be made clearer in the guidelines for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The present guidelines are still too much geared towards structural reforms. But such reforms have only limited scope for acting as an engine for growth and employment. No doubt the implementation of the financial action plan will partly close the gap in productivity between the EU and the USA, but only partly. That is why we need to aim for a higher level of investment. Increases in investment of 4% were possible in the USA during the 1990s, with a significant impact on growth and employment. So why not in the EU? There is not enough emphasis in the broad guidelines for economic policies on investment. I am not denying that it represents progress that all the EU Member States intend to invest 3% of their GDP in research and development, and that they also intend to invest more in human resources. After all, human resources are Europe's raw material.</p>
<p class="contents">However, more needs to be invested in education and training if the knowledge-based society is to become a reality in Europe. Investment would need to rise from 21% to 25%. This applies primarily to private investment needed to create production capacity and jobs which would make this sustainable growth possible in the longer term, but which would also promote technological progress and thus contribute in turn to increased demand. But public-sector investment also needs to increase. In this field we chiefly need investment in infrastructure, which was particularly hit because of the consolidation process in 2001, with a level of 2.3% of GDP. A target of 3% needs to be introduced for stability programmes here. I think that is worth considering.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion I would like to mention that the Commission is quite right to touch on the need for the coordination of fiscal policies. We know that companies are now critical of the fact that there is no scope for planning in the EU in relation to taxation and above all in relation to cross-border economic activity, something we would like to see. As much provision as possible should therefore be made in the broad guidelines for economic policies to ensure coordination where there are disruptions in the functioning of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Disciples of the other good doctor – Doctor Coué – have been saying the same thing. They see the signs of recovery almost everywhere, in the same way that a fortune-teller can predict happiness by looking at tea leaves. What we should actually be asking ourselves is whether or not we have gone into recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this reality, the liberal ideas governing the European Union’s economic policy would seem to be rather harmful. The so-called Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are starving the authorities of the resources to cope with the crisis. In light of this situation, the infamous Lisbon declaration has more to do with some magical formula than with politics, and the Commission recommendation for the 2002 Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policy of the Member States and the Community makes use of the same hocus-pocus.</p>
<p class="contents">When the invisible hand of the market works, everything works, more or less. I say more or less, because we must acknowledge that, in spite of everything, the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow inexorably. This is happening throughout the world as well as in Europe, with tragic consequences, and we see, to take the example of the Republic of France, that those politicians who appeal to the masses are waiting in the wings to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I would like to congratulate the handful of Members who recently organised the Europe of the Poor Summit in conjunction with the Fourth World Movement NGO. Seventeen per cent of the population today make up this Europe: in other words, there are 60 million people who survive on less than 60% of the average income.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to return to the idea of the invisible hand, if I may. When the hand suffers from pins and needles, tingling and rheumatism, which appears to be the case at the moment, everything stops working. It will be increasingly difficult for the Member States to respect the liberal restrictions, such as the infamous 3% threshold. And what can I say about the budgetary balance for 2004? Several States are experiencing difficulties: Germany, for example, is currently in this situation, and, as you know, Germany has the strongest economy of the Fifteen. Berlin only has to sneeze and Europe catches a cold. Take the example of our trans-Atlantic neighbours: with their usual pragmatism, the United States of North America, who extol the virtues of liberalism, have just proven once again that anti-liberal measures must occasionally be used. We would do well to draw some inspiration from that side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Tentatively, rather too tentatively in fact – and I am about to finish, Mr President – the rapporteur is introducing some homeopathic amendments using the liberal credo of the Commission. I have considerable regard for Bruno Trentin but…</p>

The Trentin report, however, shows that although Parliament is elected by the people, it represents the interests of employers alone, instead of the interests of the working classes of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The modifications requested by Parliament’s rapporteur all have the same goal, namely to make employees’ conditions worse. The aim of the report is to achieve job flexibility. It recommends what it has the cheek to call active ageing, in other words to make people work longer and to push back the age of retirement. The only reason that social policy is mentioned is to affirm with brutal cynicism that this must be a productive factor. For example, although it promotes a policy of lifelong learning, this is so that employers will have a mobile and qualified workforce to meet their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding what it calls restructuring processes – which, in actual fact, means collective redundancies – it limits itself to promoting preventative consultation of workers. The only social measure in this report is, therefore, that workers must be warned when they will be made redundant.</p>

Capital transfers, migrations flows, the labour market and pension systems have been analysed with synthetic proposals for solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The central panel of the European economic horizon is still, however, the Stability and Growth Pact, which has emerged victorious from the economic storm of recent months. After September 11, there were really very few of us who believed that the parameters established by the Pact could be respected. Now, however, the sceptics – or many of them, at least – acknowledge their mistake and have changed their views. The States which have erred in any way, particularly Germany and Portugal, have set themselves with a will to removing the uncertainties and realigning any parameters which were likely to require attention.</p>
<p class="contents">With great skill, the rapporteur covers all the economic issues and major summits, from Lisbon to Barcelona, focusing on the major challenges represented by the ever-increasing number of elderly people and by economic refugees and their families, who represent an uncertain variable for the host State because of their tendency to work illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">I know paragraph 20 of the report contains a reference to the labour market, but the issue calls for greater, more thorough analysis. The profit-sharing system and the profit-related pay system, which benefits 20% of the workforce in employment in the United Kingdom, are models which must be further explored and applied to good effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts to find the best, most productive labour processes must be matched by endeavours to improve the quality of jobs. Jobs must be developed to incorporate more creativity, to provide a better response to social requirements and to promote human dignity. An increase in professional skill is necessary for reorganisation of the production system to take place but professional skill will also be enhanced as a result of the process.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berès (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to restrict my comments to the report by Mr Bruno Trentin. First of all, I would like to thank him unreservedly for the excellent contribution that the European Parliament will make, through this report, to the broad economic policy guidelines. I shall make two points.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that, like the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament attaches great importance to the drafting of the broad economic policy guidelines. To put it simply, if this is to remain a purely academic exercise, we are wasting our time. The broad economic policy guidelines will only be meaningful if the national parliaments can be involved from the outset; so that, when drawing up the budgets of the Member States, they can bear the broad guidelines in mind. They will only be meaningful if, from the outset, the governments – particularly those of the eurozone – agree to increase coordination of their economic policies, whether this is in terms of the budget, taxation or in the area of structural policies. Otherwise, what we are doing is pointless. And we realise this when it is almost too late, when the Commission is forced to put in place early warning systems. We have a useful tool, we must use it to improve coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, my second point relates to the contribution that the European Parliament can make to the broad economic policy guidelines. We hope that, through the Convention perhaps, but also by using a specific method, the amendments that Parliament has drawn up are taken into greater account when the broad economic policy guidelines are finalised. And in this respect, I would like to highlight three of the amendments which have been proposed to you by your committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is Amendment No 6 which relates to the role of social partners and macro-economic dialogue in order to promote an employment policy. I believe that it is absolutely essential. The second is Amendment No 7, and I urge some Member States to examine this closely when they come to cut taxes, as we can only contemplate reducing taxes if there is a harmonious balance involving the lowering of debt and re-balancing in favour of public investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment will come as no surprise to you. It in fact relates to two amendments, Amendments Nos 16 and 18, which quite rightly stress the importance that we must give to services of general interest, in terms of their contribution to social and territorial cohesion of the Union, and their ability to create jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I shall try to reply and make some comments on both reports, as well as the speeches we have heard today in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with a comment on Mr Trentin’s report. Firstly, I would like to highlight its innovative approach. For the first time, a report has been presented that is not purely of a general nature, but which employs the technique of tabling amendments to the Commission’s recommendation. This appears to follow the line suggested by Mrs Berès. All the same, it is clear that the work we are currently doing has no bearing on the legislation currently in force, but it could be of enormous use in future developments in our debating system.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a series of specific points from the Trentin report that I consider to be important. As an initial comment with regard to this issue, I agree with the rapporteur’s call for a global approach, which includes economic, social and environmental aspects amongst others, and, whilst we are on this subject, I would also like to refer to Mr Blokland’s speech, in which he emphasised the need to devote more attention to environmental issues, when these are in fact fairly clearly defined in the conclusions adopted at the time on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would like to highlight from Mr Trentin’s report – investment, and social and economic cohesion. There have been various references made all day with regard to investment which I should like to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the most important factor in investment working – and this is included in the broad economic policy guidelines – is a sound macroeconomic policy. This means price stability, reduction of risk premiums, reduction of interest rates, fully operative automatic stabilisers and, in short, better investment opportunities in terms of investor confidence. However, the broad economic policy guidelines include some more specific aspects that can be relevant from this point of view: to improve the quality of public finances, with accumulation of physical and human capital referred to in the document. We also talk about the further development of integrated networks and how they can be used efficiently. I shall make another comment on Mr Goebbels’ suggestions on energy, transport and communications later.</p>
<p class="contents">We also favour the promotion of investment in knowledge, in line with what was laid down in Lisbon and Barcelona, and we believe that we should not only invest in people, in education, in professional training and in apprenticeships, but also that we should propose a specific objective for research and development of up to 3% of GDP, a figure that should be reached by 2010. I also said that when we analyse the broad economic policy guidelines, we can see some specific references to investments in large networks and the possibility of more efficient functioning, for example. Whilst we are on this subject, and with regard to energy networks and infrastructure, I should point out that in December the Commission proposed to improve the European Investment Bank cofinancing systems and also the possibility of eliminating some of the bottlenecks in service transfers from one country to another, in both electricity and gas, which will allow us to improve interconnections and, in short, to reach our objective to improve our competitiveness in the energy sector for the year 2005. We are doing something very similar with regard to the interoperability of railways, with the objective – as I said before – of improving the efficiency of our system. Therefore, it is highly important – and Mr Goebbels made a reference to this point – that investments should be sound and should not cause problems related to the poor use of public money.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath also referred to the problem of investment, suggesting the idea, which to me seems ambitious, to try to achieve an EU public investment level of 3%, the same as the United States, according to her. This is a point that we as the Commission, however, do not see in quantitative, but in qualitative terms, and we focus on our broad economic policy guidelines to highlight the importance of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Marinos emphasises the importance of the Stability and Growth Pact more directly and, throughout the debate this morning and afternoon, there have been some proposals that seem important.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Marinos focuses – and I can only thank him for this – on the importance of maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact in its present form. He mentioned not making political concessions, particularly to large Member States. This has never been the Commission’s vision, which is, in fact, that we should give equal treatment to all Member States, and we have always acted with this in mind. Our actions have even included the use of certain instruments that have sparked a certain amount of public debate. I am, of course, referring to the early warning system applied in Germany and Portugal, where I feel that, although we are not happy with the procedure – and as a member of the Commission I have stated this on more than one occasion – we are satisfied with the proposed objective.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue raised by Mr Marinos, which was also highlighted by some other speakers, is whether the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact are complementary or, to some extent, contradictory instruments. From the Commission’s point of view, the broad economic policy guidelines are the general framework and the Stability and Growth Pact the instrument we have with which to implement coordination in the specific field of budget deficit. These are very important for us to be able to achieve our two objectives through the coordination of economic policy: that fiscal policy should not hinder monetary policy and cause no externalities or spin off<span class="italic"> </span>effects that would have negative effects on other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, it is vital that we should maintain the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form and we believe that deficits are growth’s worst enemy, as experience has taught us over the last few years. Therefore, we must have sound macroeconomic policies to be able to increase growth and, consequently, to increase employment. This means that the Stability Pact should not be so rigid that it cannot be adapted to match new situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the experience gained over the past two years, clearly set out in our proposals, proves that the Stability Pact can also function in situations of economic slowdown. Mr Jonckheer expressed this concern this morning. I would say that the pact has worked well, that the automatic stabilisers have allowed us to adopt an expansionary fiscal stance. It is true that this has not been a discretionary policy, but we believe that the Pact has been as important – in relative terms and given the importance of automatic stabilisers – in Europe, as certain discretionary policies may have been in the United States. We believe that the advantage of our proposed system is not only its automatic operation, but also its capacity to avoid potential problems in future, especially when we have to deal with new situations of economic recovery in which we start from relatively comfortable positions in terms of budgetary balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Some other issues were raised this morning and this afternoon. Mr García-Margallo y Marfil this evening referred, in terms possibly close to his and my own, to the situation of dogmas and ecclesiastic definitions of the guardian of the dogma. Obviously, no one is claiming to be the guardian of any dogma, but it is clear that, as the Commission, we have the role of guardian of the Treaties, which means that we are obliged to apply the commitments as proposed. In this regard, we think that it is vitally important that the Stability Pact continues to be applied to all countries under the same conditions it has been applied up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two further comments on what was said this morning. The issue of enlargement, as some of you have suggested, is not the objective of the broad economic policy guidelines. There are specific documents that deal with this issue and we are working on a system that allows us gradually to come closer to the broad guidelines so that we can apply them after enlargement has taken place. My second comment is directed to Mrs Berès. I have noted with great interest the references to the proposals for specific amendments and we will gratefully pass these on to the Council, which is now responsible for taking decisions on broad economic policy guidelines, given that this function is now out of the Commission’s hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
