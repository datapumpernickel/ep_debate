<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vander Taelen (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with some emotion that I am taking the floor today, although I had naturally hoped for a better turnout. It is indeed the last time that I will be delivering a speech in this Parliament, because, as of 1 September, I will be heading the foundation concerned with granting funding in order to improve Flemish cinema. And this is ultimately the object of the work I have been doing here for these three years. This is also what the European Commission is trying to do, namely what I will be trying to do in Flanders and also at European level. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Commission communication on which my report is based proved to be a very positive step in the right direction. The main merit of the communication – and I make reference to this in my report – is precisely that things will at last become more transparent, mainly in the legal field, and that an attempt has been made to inject some clarity into the ambiguities surrounding what was, and was not, acceptable in the area of state support to the audiovisual sector. We can only applaud this. </p>
<p class="contents">However, if we view the communication from a different angle, then it is regrettable that the European Commission seems always to be weighed down by a lack of ambition where audiovisual policy is concerned. A great deal of importance is being attached to compliance with the competitive rules. As if the audiovisual sector in Europe were facing competition. It is extremely remarkable that Europe should invest so much time looking at the situations in the different Member States, while these Member States are being completely crushed by a competitor who is not, however, an EU Member, fortunately. I am talking about the United States, whose film production accounts for 80% to 85% of the cinema visits in most European countries. This is naturally a staggering statistic. In the light of such a disastrous situation, one can only hope that the European Commission will finally succeed in taking a realistic initiative which is of a standard that befits the European Union. After all, it is not set in stone that Europe should lag behind the American film industry. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, however – and the European Parliament has referred to this in previous reports – that the Member States are having to contend with various handicaps. It is therefore high time that the European Commission showed not only that it is aware of this, which is obviously the case, but also that it is also willing to commit funding. </p>
<p class="contents">It remains a crying shame – and the example has been given so many times that it has become a little stale – it remains so illustrative that Europe spends 10 times more on support measures for the tobacco industry than on the media programme. You are better off being an olive grower than a filmmaker in Europe. In this respect, Europe has a clear-cut, outspoken policy. However, in the case of one of the most ambitious sectors is involved where the prospects are most appealing, also in terms of employment, Europe fails to produce the goods. No, I am exaggerating, Europe is present but in an extremely modest way. </p>
<p class="contents">As my final appeal in the European Parliament, I would urge the European Parliament to continue to press the European Commission and the Member States hard so that maybe one day, a real European policy will be adopted which will be able to give the European citizens what they are entitled to, namely their own high-quality audiovisual industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is a true advocate for European film. Even if he is lost to Parliament, he will be our gain as a partner among the experts. I think we will continue to work very well together.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, though, also grateful to the Commission for the report it has submitted, which gives us the opportunity to draw up an interim balance sheet. After a good three years' work by Parliament and the Commission, where do we stand? In my view, this interim balance sheet shows one thing, namely that the European film industry is strong when we work together – Parliament, Commission, and Council, laborious though that sometimes is, with the professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance sheet for the past three years proves that we have achieved important things. Let me address just three of them. Firstly, the proportion of films other than of national European origin shown in European Union cinemas has increased by 21% over the past year. That means that our media programme has made a quite substantial contribution to achieving this important objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, thanks to the initiative by Commissioner Reding and Parliament, the European Investment Bank has launched a fund to make available for audio-visual works urgently needed risk capital which totals EUR 400 million in this year alone. This is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission has examined competition law with reference to the promotion of films by Member States and acknowledged that all of them do so in a legitimate way, so we have gained a good deal more security for European film. We cannot, however, rest on these laurels. This report highlights the most pressing problems that we have to deal with – and at EU level – over the coming years. We must also deal with them through initiatives on the part of the Member States. It is for that that I appeal to the Council, which insists on subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listed only three points. We need to move over to qualified majority voting to have an efficient working basis under Article 151 of the Treaties. We need pilot projects for our digital heritage, and subsidy law needs to have proper provisions for the future of European film.</p>

Mr Vander Taelen has again acquitted himself outstandingly of his task of commenting on the Commission communication, for which I thank him warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, we stimulate investments in film production by means of fiscal measures for the limited partnerships that invest in film production. I welcome this mainly because the exemption clause for culture of Article 87(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community allows for this. Yet, this is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two points. The EIB and the EIF can make an important financial contribution, especially where European film production is concerned, that involves production measures from different Member States. I would call into question whether we should go so far as to involve the EIB in the purchase of digital projection equipment for cinemas, as proposed by Mr Vander Taelen. My group fears that this would open the floodgates to arbitrariness and competitive distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to remind you that as long as we do not know what the public want, we cannot adopt a targeted promotion policy for the European film. It is therefore essential for research to be done into the motives of the film-going public regarding their film choices. In addition, it is of crucial importance for young people to be involved in European film too. Cinematographic training and <span class="italic">e</span>-learning are the appropriate ways of familiarising them with our film production and of teaching them to appreciate these.</p>
<p class="contents">The exciting initiative to set up a pan-European children’s channel in order to broadcast the better European children’s films on a Europe-wide scale receives my warm consideration, and it is an excellent instrument to achieve this. In this way, the European citizen is made aware of our extremely diverse European culture from a very young age, as it is expressed, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in the European film, and we need to duly commit to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you for everything that you have done over the last three years and to echo the comments made by the previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just make a few comments on the circulation of films. Not only will the review of the Television without Frontiers Directive not take place, but what is more, at the same time, other parties are proposing to set up a television channel in Europe for broadcasting films. I would like to know the Commission’s thoughts on the initiative taken – amongst others – by Belgium in setting up this channel. Once again, I am wondering how to define concepts such as the ‘European work’.</p>
<p class="contents">We were promised that this would be discussed together with the review of the Television without Frontiers Directive. The debate will not take place since the directive is not being reviewed. The question remains, however. Given that there are so many audiovisual broadcasting channels, there is also the problem of frontiers for audiovisual works. Is a television show a piece of audiovisual work and how is it circulated? Is it broadcast on a European cinema television channel? I feel that all these questions are sufficiently important to merit an answer from us. Basically, the question I ask time and time again is that regarding the cultural content of audiovisual and cinematographic industrial production. How will we protect the cultural content?</p>
<p class="contents">I have a second question to put to the Commission. I believe that the Commission is open to the idea of creating an international instrument that works in parallel with the WTO and is dedicated to cultural issues. We know that a group of experts from France and Quebec carried out a feasibility study on this instrument. Things are therefore taking on a slightly more concrete form. This is a subject that closely concerns us, as Members of the European Parliament, and I would like to open up the debate on this. I think that Mrs Reding and Mr Lamy have, on several occasions, boldly echoed this proposal. I would therefore like, in the interests of cultural heritage, some clarification on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has always produced fine, high-quality work with a completely democratic approach. He enjoys cooperating and always works within the consensus. I am genuinely sorry that he will be leaving.</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate the Commission on this attempt to make some changes to the laws on the distribution of European cinematographic works and I welcome some aspects of the communication, to which I shall refer shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned that, yet again, we are seeing some fundamental timidity and I believe that this is due to the fact that the viewing platform, in other words, the place from which we are looking at the cinema and the audiovisual image and where we hope to find competitiveness, is not the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I believe that the relationship between culture and industry is not clear-cut. We still see culture as something different, as a world apart, which is subject to subsidiarity, but can we say that digital cinema is only culture? The protection and support measures are still small measures, of limited ambition, despite the fact that many things have been achieved, due in part to Parliament and to Mr Hieronymi: for example, the considerable involvement of the ICB. This is not enough, however. One aspect of this timidity is the way in which the digital world is being dealt with; borders are being dismantled, we are being left without any and projection rooms are being all but eliminated. This is, therefore, a qualitative leap that requires changes in our policies and radical new approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the idea that the solution for the digital world could be to support the development of research and the sixth framework programme is appropriate for dealing with an issue that will develop not in four years but in twenty-seven. Joining the digital world means revolutionising our technological system in most cases, providing Europe with a base that will make it stronger and concerning ourselves as soon as possible with the issue of post-production. I believe that we have not yet done so because there is a fear of establishing a relationship between culture and industry, because if we entered the world of the industry we would have to enter the world of competition and we still believe that culture must have barriers. The problem, however, is that we are too late.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, and in light of this call to speak in modern and contemporary terms and with an understanding of the technological revolution that is going to revolutionise the cultural scene, I should also like to say that the daring and the courageousness of calling outright for the conservation of our audiovisual heritage seem most appropriate. I think that this is a very relevant and courageous move and I welcome it. Furthermore, we must produce a database. It makes perfect sense to acknowledge digital copyright and together to address the possibility of producing a law or a measure that we can all agree on. I still believe, however, that the problems between the world of industry and that of the image cannot be resolved through subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all love the cinema, which has had the best possible advocate in the European Parliament in the person of Mr Vander Taelen. I hope we shall not lose touch and that we shall meet him regularly in his new position and continue to work together as well as we have in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The cinema, the seventh and most recent addition to the arts, has always combined art and industry, quality and mass appeal and has educated entire generations of Europeans. However, we also know that, as things now stand, it is being suffocated by American blockbusters. So far, Parliament and the European Union have taken political decisions to support cinematographic and audiovisual works, but more needs to be done and the Vander Taelen report quite rightly proposes legislative and fiscal measures in this direction, as well as looking at research and archives. However, we are coming up to three crucial milestones: 2004, when decisions will be taken on state aid, 2005 for negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and an undetermined date, which keeps receding ever further into the future, for revising the Television without Frontiers directive. But before we reach these milestones, we need to explore every avenue and use all our political inventiveness to save European cinema and audiovisual works. Luckas Vander Taelen has done so and deserves our congratulations. We should not leave his initiative hanging in mid air and we therefore hope that the Commission will respond to it as specifically as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Mr Vander Taelen for drafting this report and welcomes and supports the conclusions that have been drawn. We shall, of course, take into account the comments made and the requests that you have put together, all the more so since Mr Vander Taelen has reminded us that this report is, to an extent, the message that he is leaving us as his legacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication on the film industry indicates the importance that the Commission attaches to the film industry and, more broadly speaking, to the audiovisual sector as a whole, for the development of our policies. We are, for our part, fully aware of and pleased with the agreement between Parliament and the Commission on these subjects. In addition, this House has already shown how much attention it has paid to this sector with the previous own-initiative report, also drafted by Mr Vander Taelen, a report which dealt with achieving better circulation of European films in the internal market and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the communication on the film industry clearly explains the Commission’s positive and constructive approach towards national aid to the film industry. The audiovisual and film sector, which is specific due its dual – i.e. economic and cultural – nature, meaning that it is not left to the mercy of market forces alone, is also forced to continually adapt to constantly changing circumstances. The Commission has given its approval each time it has been notified by the Member States of state aids for supporting the national film industry. The national systems examined by the Commission are now fixed until 2004, which does not mean, however, that they would become illegal and that they would then have to be reviewed. This date simply means that, until then, the criteria that the Commission presented will not change and that, were they to change at a later date, then this would be due to new information that had come to light showing that such and such a problem had occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other subjects mentioned in Mr Vander Taelen’s report are concerned, I would particularly like to point out that the Commission will support digital film – and I am responding here to Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortinez’s comments – and digitising of archives through various pilot projects included in the MEDIA plus programme. The other follow-up actions from the communication are currently being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the investigations into legal deposit procedures and registration schemes, groups of film industry experts will be convened this autumn and we shall commence the debate on the results of these investigations. Lastly, the studies which were announced in the communication have been started and the final reports should be available at the end of the year. And finally, I should like to point out to Mrs Fraisse that the work on the review of the Television without Frontiers Directive is underway. The first of three major studies has been published on the Commission’s web site. The two others will be published at a later date. We shall adopt in committee the report on the directive’s application between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I respond to two or three specific points, let us simply remember that the Commission’s communication, on which the report we are discussing this evening is based, is merely a first stage. We shall continue to work together to achieve the common goal that each of you, without exception, has mentioned this evening which is the vitality, development and growth of a creative and diversified European audiovisual sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the two or three slightly more specific questions, Mrs Sanders ten-Holte spoke of European cinema heritage. I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to the CinEd@ys week which will take place between 15 and 24 November and which is designed to enable European citizens to discover some of the treasures of European film via the Internet and at their cinemas, thereby helping to make them more popular.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Fraisse’s question concerning the idea of a European cinema television channel, this project has been discussed in various quarters for some time now. We have already financed a study that was carried out in 1997, the results of which were not very conclusive. State broadcasters are still studying the dossier, but there are obviously still a number of problems, particularly to do with copyright and the interests of producers who, putting funding, profitability and audience issues aside, have put the brakes on this project for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the idea, Mrs Fraisse – and I will finish with this point – of an international instrument establishing the principles of cultural diversity and the associates objectives relating to international agreements, to be honest, this idea has been up in the air for some time now. In this respect, some interesting work was carried out at UNESCO, but this work has not yet attained a sufficient level, either in terms of quality, or detail, or in terms of countries that are participating or willing to take part in this project. In the meantime, therefore, we shall continue the debate at the World Trade Organisation on the aspects relating to international trade negotiations within the audiovisual sector. We shall continue, as before, to fulfil the mandate that we were given, and which is to protect cultural diversity in this area, as in others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
