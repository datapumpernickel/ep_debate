<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moscovici (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the political context in which I am tabling this report has become clearer in recent weeks. Last week the Commission was able to close accession negotiations with Romania on the last two chapters, namely justice and home affairs, and competition. Moreover, legislative elections and then presidential elections have also been held in recent weeks, putting a different political party in power under conditions that have been recognised by all of the parties. This information obviously does not change the philosophy and general thrust of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to draft and submit a balanced report to the House, that is to say a report that was both rigorous and clear, because Romania’s situation poses many problems. Yet I also wanted it to be a friendly report, because we all want Romania and Bulgaria to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we are proposing that we both take note of Romania’s progress towards accession and also remain aware of its limits and shortcomings, and the extent of the work that remains to be done. These two aspects, the limits and the progress, are actually set out for each of the areas in question.</p>
<p class="contents">They are presented first with regard to the political criteria, and it is there without any doubt that the main difficulties lie. There are limits to the progress made; for example, the reform of the civil service does not go far enough, the use of emergency ordinances is not desirable and quite excessive, and as for legislative procedures, everyone knows that they are not perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">But over and above this limited progress, a number of problems, serious problems, remain as far as freedoms are concerned. I am thinking firstly of the freedom of information and expression, which is denied to a great many journalists. I am thinking of the judicial system, which despite initial improvements is unquestionably in need of further attention. I am thinking, of course, of corruption, which is still endemic in Romania, even at high levels. On all of these problems – freedom of expression, corruption, the judicial and police systems – I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to be absolutely uncompromising.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that progress has undoubtedly been made. The Commission has recognised that Romania satisfies the Copenhagen political criteria; the country has embarked on public administration reform, and constitutional reform is also underway. The judicial system, as I have said, is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection – requested by our own Parliament, incidentally – even though it is possible to go further. Overall then, I believe that Romania has listened to the recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament, in particular those that were made at the instigation of the previous rapporteur, Mrs Nicholson.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the same problem with the economic criteria: there are limits to the progress made, macroeconomic stability is not yet guaranteed and poverty remains at quite excessive levels. At the same time, we have seen progress in the fight against social exclusion, in the fight against poverty and in the adoption of legislation on social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final area is everything to do with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. As I said at the outset, negotiations on this are complete. Moreover, I do not believe that it would be wise to reopen them, although I have read that the newly-elected president intends to do so. For my part, I think that the treaty should first be ratified and signed before it is renegotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, however, to implement the legislation that has been adopted, in particular that relating to the free movement of goods and capital, financial control, the environment, industrial production, regional policy and issues of justice and home affairs. This assessment, which I hope is balanced, is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending, and they are as follows: as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty – I repeat, a joint treaty – being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007. Clearly this is a political decision, but Parliament and the Commission need to keep a close watch on developments through all of the follow-up actions and other reports that we can table here.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word on the amendments tabled: we did a good job, in my opinion, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which enabled the report to be adopted by a very large majority. The remaining amendments to the report fall into two categories. There are those that improve the substance of the report, in particular on social protection, human rights, the disabled, the protection of children and young people, and recommendations on industrial policy, and I am obviously in favour of these. Then there are other amendments that call into question the existence of a joint accession treaty or which change the nature and balance of the report, which clearly I do not support.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we made the historic decision to open negotiations with Turkey. I believe that concluding them with Romania and Bulgaria, and with Romania in particular, is, in contrast, a logical decision, and people would not understand if we did not do both of these things together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to inform you here formally that on 14 December 2004 the General Affairs Council also closed the negotiations with Romania. As I said when referring to Bulgaria, it is a new step towards a really reunited Europe based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I will elaborate briefly on the process of closing the last challenging chapters with Romania and focus on the monitoring system developed to ensure a proper start for Romania within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The two remaining chapters, which have been regarded as the most difficult ones – competition policy, and justice and home affairs – were technically closed by the General Affairs Council on 14 December 2004. I believe we have been able to find appropriate solutions for all the issues raised in those final weeks through close and constructive cooperation between the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, closing these two chapters means that the real work continues for the Romanians. Over the next two years Romania will have to make real and sustained efforts in order to be truly ready for membership. Good intentions are not enough: these must be matched by progress on the ground, in particular in the implementation of commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will of course continue to support the preparations at all levels: the Commission will enhance the monitoring of progress commitments undertaken in all areas of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We learned from representatives of both governments that monitoring systems helped them very much in continuing, and even intensifying, the reforms needed.</p>
<p class="contents">On competition policy, this chapter is at the core of the internal market and European economic integration. The proper enforcement of EU competition rules is a precondition for creating a reliable business environment and requires appropriate administrative capacity. This is a long-term process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for those reasons that competition discipline is also a key aspect of the Europe agreement. Other key aspects are legislative alignment and the institutional and administrative structures in Romania. What needs to be done to bring all legislation, including secondary legislation, into line with the requirements in the areas of antitrust and State aid, in particular in relation to fiscal aid?</p>
<p class="contents">The Romanian Competition Council should be given the powers, resources and the well-trained staff it needs to fulfil its role. This Council should prohibit any measures which would be in contradiction with the State aid <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the Europe agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the steel sector, which is a sensitive sector across the EU. Romania has asked for a prolongation of the so-called 'grace period' under the Europe agreement for restructuring the steel industry. Again, we only agreed to this now it is clear that Romania will abide by all the commitments and all the conditions set out in the EU's position. These commitments include drawing up a national restructuring programme as well as an individual business plan, capacity reduction and dismantling of the installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union expects Romania to respect all its commitments and take all the necessary measures within the deadlines laid down in the EU's position. In this context, I should recall the safeguards we have at our disposal. In October 2005 the Commission will present to the Council a written report assessing Romania's progress in the area of competition policy. Any serious shortcomings observed in this report regarding Romania's obligations under the Europe agreement and/or the fulfilment of the commitments can form the basis for a recommendation by the Commission to invoke safeguards, in particular the one postponing Romania's accession by one year. Here the Council can decide by a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">On this understanding, I have come to the conclusion that this chapter does not require further negotiations. Let me say that it is now in Romania's hands to ensure that it meets all its commitments in this chapter, allowing Romania's smooth integration into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to justice and home affairs, this is a chapter which is both extensive and complex. It is at the heart of our objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. It has a direct bearing on the lives of every EU citizen, and is therefore a key part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> which must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on this chapter have been long and detailed. Romania has made a considerable number of firm commitments on all areas of the justice and home affairs <span class="italic">acquis</span>. There are several areas to which particular attention should be paid, such as implementation of the Schengen action plan; ensuring a high level of control and surveillance at the external borders of the Union; implementing the reform of the judiciary; stepping up the fight against corruption to ensure that corruption cases are dealt with in a swift and transparent manner; making considerable progress in filling the large number of vacancies in the police forces; as well as developing and implementing a coherent multiannual anti-crime strategy. These issues have also been addressed in Mr Moscovici's report on Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will closely monitor Romania's implementation of all its commitments related to justice and home affairs, right up to the moment of accession in order to meet EU standards. This includes adhering to the planned legislative schedule and taking further measures to develop the institutional and administrative capacity of all Romanian law enforcement authorities and of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this should be possible if the necessary political effort, as well as the required financial and human resources, are deployed to this end. If, however, any serious shortcomings are observed in the fulfilment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments listed in the EU position, this can form the basis for invoking the safeguard clause postponing Romania's accession by one year. Here again, the Council can decide by qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will continue to monitor closely Romania's preparations and achievements, including the effective implementation of the commitments undertaken in all areas of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and in particular the areas of justice and home affairs, competition and the environment. To this end, the Commission will continue to submit annual reports on Romania's progress towards accession, together with recommendations if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the statement in the report by Mr Moscovici that the European Parliament will monitor the developments in Romania as well and encourage the new Romanian Government to fulfil all the commitments made during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the report adopted by the European Parliament in March 2004 has fulfilled its purpose as a wake-up call to the Romanian Government. That is how the Romanian Government has perceived it; and it has convinced it to intensify the accession strategy and policies. I was delighted to learn that Parliament, in its latest report about Romania, could subscribe to the recommendations of the regular report of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then – and I paraphrase the wording of the Commission – we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004, on the basis of its own merits, with a view to signing the Accession Treaty as early as possible in 2005, and we all expect Bulgaria and Romania to fulfil the economic and <span class="italic">acquis</span> criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, your report of March 2004 was a real 'wake-up call' for Romania. Being tough and very demanding, it finally helped to bring about further progress in the accession negotiations. It led, with the Commission's impetus, to a series of reforms, which were listed in Romania’s famous 'To Do List', under which the Romanian authorities put greater emphasis on improving political and economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Nicolaï said, the Union will now finalise the accession negotiations with Romania on Friday. However, I underline that concluding the negotiations does not mean the end of the work. On the contrary, the two-year period to 2007 must be used by Romania to become a full-fledged Member State: plenty of hard work, commitment and especially delivery is needed. We will carry out an enhanced monitoring of compliance with the commitments entered into and of ongoing preparations in general.</p>
<p class="contents">For Romania and Bulgaria, we have agreed a new safeguard clause covering the period between closure of the negotiations and actual accession. This clause provides for the postponement of accession by one year if there is clear evidence that Romania will be manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership. The Member States could then activate the suspension clause by unanimity, on the basis of the Commission’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that in the chapter concerning competition and state aids, the Commission was not able to propose a provisional closure of negotiations. However, the Council, due to earlier political commitments, chose to close the negotiations by the end of 2004. Moreover, in regard to justice and home affairs, the Council asked for more reassuring enforcement mechanisms. Therefore, in close cooperation with the Netherlands presidency, the Commission worked out a proposal for a reinforced monitoring mechanism linked to safeguard clauses in these two areas: justice and home affairs, and competition and state aids.</p>
<p class="contents">In these areas, the suspension clause can be activated by a qualified majority of the Member States, which gives it stronger credibility than if it were only activated by unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause. Should the monitoring by the Commission show that Romania is not properly prepared for membership, we should not hesitate to recommend that the Council invoke this suspension clause. To be absolutely clear: the aim of this clause is not to penalise Romania, but to protect Romania and the EU Member States from any negative effects that Romania’s possible manifest unpreparedness for membership might entail.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing, let me briefly touch upon the political situation in Romania. I know that Parliament is concerned about alleged irregularities in the parliamentary and presidential elections that recently took place in Romania. I am also aware of the assessments made by several Romanian NGOs. However, I would like to recall that the OSCE election assessment team stated that overall the administration of the Romanian elections 'seemed professional and efficiently organised'. I also note that the OSCE has assessed the overall conduct of the election as satisfactory in the second round. Moreover, both presidential candidates accepted the final results of the presidential elections. I trust – and this is important for the European Union as well as for Romania – that the new president-elect and the forthcoming government in formation will be determined to continue with the reforms that are needed for Romania to accede to the European Union. That is very much in the interest of Romania and Romanians.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I endorse the conclusions of the report by your rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, which are, in general, in line with the 2004 Regular Report. The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of Romania’s progress towards accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to point out that the total volume of this aid is approximately equivalent to 1.4% of the country’s GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the case of Bulgaria, the Committee on Budgets is pleased about the establishment in spring 2004 of the new funding framework for the accession of Romania. It is also pleased that, as for Bulgaria, the Commission has proposed restricting this package of aid to a period of three years in order that it may be adapted to the future political needs stemming from the new financial perspectives that are going to be approved. All of the financial aid will depend on these new financial perspectives, but from 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike what happened in the case of the report on Bulgaria, in this case the Committee on Budgets wishes to stress the need to make sustained efforts to enhance Romania’s administrative capacity with regard to the essential fields of customs, VAT and statistics on gross domestic product. This means having appropriate capacity to collect and control VAT and customs duties, and to calculate gross domestic product credibly, precisely and exhaustively, in accordance with the SEC 95 rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank him for his open attitude and his spirit of compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the last two years, Romania has made very significant progress on its journey towards integration with the European Union. I naturally welcome this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">A decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday. The closure of these negotiations is expected to be confirmed at the European Council this week, but it is clear that the work is not over.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Romania has important work to do before the accession scheduled for 2007 can take place. I am not only talking about the procedures necessary for full ratification of the Treaty; it must also intensify its efforts in a series of essential areas. To this end, it must carry out the reforms in the field of public administration, it must improve judicial administration and ensure that it is independent – a field in which it adopted an important legislative package a few months ago; it must enhance the fight against corruption, a serious problem which continues to affect the country. And efforts are also needed in the field of preserving the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my position and the report essentially consists of the following: on the one hand, an open and positive view of Romania’s accession to the European Union within the scheduled timescale. On the other hand, a demanding position in relation to the efforts Romania must make, which will require determination and perseverance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the clear twin message that the Romanian authorities now in office following the elections of recent days must receive. Through this report, the European Parliament is saying yes to the integration of Romania, but it will be monitoring that country’s compliance with all of its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament must follow the efforts the Romanian authorities must make very closely. We are also counting on the information that the Commission must send out regularly to us in this regard, as the Commissioner has pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on this journey Romania still has to make towards accession, it can count on our vigilance, but, of course, it can also count on our assistance and our impetus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report mentions both the positive and the negative aspects, the strong points and the weak points, which Romania will have to address.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, the report clearly states that Romania meets the Copenhagen political criteria, that it has strengthened the stability of its institutions that guarantee State democracy and human rights, and that the situation has improved in the field of protection of human and ethnic rights, with regard to both the Hungarian minority and the Roma minority. On the positive side, Romania also fulfils the criterion of a functioning market economy and, moreover, has implemented and is continuing to implement a programme of structural reforms. If we look at the economic results, the economic statistics for Romania, we can see that the country has one of the strongest growth rates in the whole of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Romania still has to make considerable efforts and make significant progress, however, before it can be accepted into the European Union. Both Mr Nicolaï and Mr Rehn have referred to certain aspects in detail. I should like to mention a few of them: the areas of justice and internal affairs, like everywhere in Eastern Europe, the fight against corruption and against organised crime, and also border controls. Problems also remain in the fields of economic competition, of state support and, of course, of protecting the natural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, however, I believe that Romania is well on the way. It is up to Romania and Romania alone as to whether it will manage to eliminate all the weak points in the coming months. If it does succeed, I am of the opinion that the treaty should be signed in 2005 so that Romania, along with Bulgaria, can be accepted into the European Union in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed I enjoyed and valued his work in his earlier capacity as a minister. It is just as much of a pleasure to work with him as a rapporteur. I thank Mr Moscovici for this fine work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that President Iliescu – as he retires from his second and final term of office – and his government, as well as Prime Minister Nastase, have concluded their work on a high note. They should be proud of their successful achievement of the enlargement process for Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy today to damn Romania with faint praise, to say that she has done well but has a huge amount more to do. That may indeed be true, but let us recall the low position from which she has come and has advanced so rapidly. None of us would have dreamed five years ago, when the Helsinki Council declared Romania to be one of the 'regatta principle' countries, that she could have completed the chapters so rapidly and indeed so well.</p>
<p class="contents">All the chapters are closed. Of course, implementation must be high on the agenda of the new government and it will have to have very competent people to implement this matter. They have to apply the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> properly and respect the deadlines. A great deal of capacity-building has to happen. Administrative capacity is vital in applying the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire,</span> as well as ongoing training of staff.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us remember what an enormous amount has been achieved. One of the ways in which we could help is by trying to stop the brain drain. Romania needs its young people very badly. We should do all we can to strengthen the position of higher education in Romania, to help the country offer jobs, training and workshops to young people. It would be very easy, as Romania comes ever closer to the Union, for us to be a magnet for her young people to leave the country. That would be a very great pity. It is those young people who will assist Romania in implementing the <span class="italic">acquis</span> correctly and improving the absorption capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commission too for the very dedicated work which colleagues and I have seen carried out over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I have put forward one amendment, at which I would ask Mr Moscovici and other colleagues to look carefully. They have acknowledged that I have been concentrating in particular on the issue of children. While I understood and respected Mr Moscovici's support for Prime Minister Raffarin's request for an international commission to re-examine certain sensitive cases on humanitarian grounds where there have been problems with inter-country adoption, nonetheless, I wonder if colleagues might consider accepting my amendment to paragraph 17.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moscovici's report requests an international commission. That is one outside the European Union. My own amendment asks the Commission to take up this matter with the Romanian Government – which is right and proper – and also to report back to the government of Romania and – since I know that colleagues are concerned about this – to the European Parliament as well. Perhaps Mr Moscovici and I could discuss this. I am sure he would find that it is more in keeping with the spirit of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group does not have any fundamental objections to Romania’s membership either, not even on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a debate, however, between those who think that, except for a few loose ends, Romania is ready, and those, myself included, who think that it is not, and see that as a reason why we cannot give the go-ahead right now. I am, in all honesty, surprised at the position of some groups. The very same Members of this House who rightly attached great importance to human rights during the vote and discussions about Turkey, a country that is on the very threshold of negotiations, are, in the case of Romania, a country that is completing them, prepared to overlook just about anything where the same Copenhagen criteria are concerned. There are yet other Members in this House whose view of reality has, quite honestly, been somewhat clouded by the fact that members of their parties are probably involved in reprehensible affairs, or because they hope that, after the recent elections in Romania, everything will be very different overnight. Hope for improvement is fine, but we should not be naive. The problems in Romania are immense, so much so that there is no doubt in my mind that we cannot give them the green light.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you two examples. Over the past few years, there has been no improvement in the situation of journalists and the media in Romania; indeed, it has changed for the worse. The number of attacks on critical journalists has increased and the criticism levelled at them was often connected to cases of corruption. All NGOs, all the organisations that we always praise so highly – Transparency International, the Open Society Institute, the OECD – all have one message: corruption is still rife in Romania and should not be underestimated. Of course, everyone here will state that corruption is to be combated, but how seriously can we take a party which has a majority in the Romanian parliament and a member of which – also a former minister – had to step down a few years ago on account of corruption, and is now vice-chairman of that same party and a candidate for the senate?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this, together with Amnesty International’s reports about the truly abominable treatment of psychiatric patients, can only lead to one conclusion, namely that Romania should wait for a little longer. That is why I should like to ask the Commission why it should not draft a separate report next spring, for example, on the aspects which everyone, including the rapporteur, worry about, namely freedom of the press, corruption, independence of the judiciary? The Commission does compile a report on possible problems concerning competition, but refuses to devote a fresh report to human rights problems. Why should state support be a stumbling block and human rights not?</p>
<p class="contents">To those who say – and that is also a comment with regard to the Commission and the presidency – that we still have the suspension clause at our disposal, which enables us to delay Romania’s accession by one year, I should like to state clearly that this suspension clause can only be invoked if there is a unanimous vote in favour of it. In other words, if one country in the Council refuses to cooperate, then it will not happen. What about qualified majority? Regrettably, that can only be applied to a number of specific areas, and freedom of the press is not one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Parliament should not relinquish its power by giving the go-ahead now and, logically, doing the same thing in March. Parliament must take itself seriously. I would like to quote from a major Dutch newspaper: 'With friendliness that lacks honesty, Europe may become big, but it is growth without substance, greatness without inner strength’. The strength of the European Union is to be found in principles that apply universally, including to political allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tradition goes hand in hand with an intolerant attitude towards its ethnic minorities – Hungarians, Roma and Germans. A great deal of attention is always paid to major dam projects, enormous factories and monumental buildings, but not to vagrant children menaced by glue sniffing or prostitution, or to serious environmental pollution. In Rosia Montana, there is still the risk of a gold extraction project going ahead, which will use chemical substances capable of seriously polluting the soil and river water in the long term. In the cities, the monumental facades hide decay, neglect and poverty. Freedom of the press and independence of the judiciary do not meet European standards. In neighbouring Moldavia, which came under Russian rule in 1940, there was initial support for reunification, but, as Romania has little to offer at the moment, that support has now ebbed away.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, many Romanians look up to America and the dollar above all, and, to a lesser extent, to Turkey, which is regarded as a major economic partner and an example of a self-assured country. At international level, Romania is currently, like Turkey, a close ally of the United States, so much so that it is hindering cooperation with the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">Complaints about election fraud were lodged again recently. I do not expect the careless interpretation of parliamentary democracy to disappear following last weekend’s election of a president from the other side of the political spectrum, who is also likely to determine the composition of a new government. This new government will probably take the view that the previous government was too meek in its negotiations with the European Union and that it had allowed itself to be humiliated.</p>
<p class="contents">In its previous composition, this parliament was extremely critical about the possibility of Romania fulfilling in the short term the current EU criteria in terms of democracy, human rights and the environment. That is why it seemed certain that Romania would be joining later than Bulgaria, together with Croatia at the very earliest. I am surprised at the recent U-turn within the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rejection of a number of critical amendments. The fear that Romania might be humiliated and the EU’s ambition for speedy territorial expansion now appear more imperative than solving problems. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left would like to welcome Romania to the European Union as quickly as possible, provided that, as is the case with Turkey, solutions have been found to the problems in the areas of democracy, human rights and the environment, and this is still a huge obstacle at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, Basescu will be the first to admit this frankly. In an interview with the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span> of 26 November, Basescu, who is at present the mayor of Bucharest, gave this explanation of why he is striving to turn his country round politically: ‘The problem is corruption which, in this country, has been elevated to a form of government’.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Moscovici is just as clear about Bucharest’s failings as it makes its way to Brussels, and we sincerely appreciate the way in which he has done this, quite rightly tracing Romania’s shortcomings in terms of all the accession criteria, including the political conditions. In the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country, I asked for attention to be paid to violations of the freedom of the press. Unfortunately, this report mentions these violations again in Paragraph 8. It is as plain as day that there is physical aggression against investigative journalists, and that the government exerts pressure on financially weak media.</p>
<p class="contents">In his recent book ‘Threatened journalists, beaten journalists’, the author and journalist Malin Bot confirmed this depressing image. The book is an outright indictment of the prevailing press restraint in Romania. Mr Basescu and his political sympathisers therefore have their work cut out. Incidentally, in our regions, in Western Europe, we should take note of what Malin Bot has to say about the dubious role of Western publishers who have bought up many Romanian papers, and who, in his words, ‘do not come to Romania to defend democracy, but simply to make money’.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a new Romanian Government takes the European accession criteria entirely seriously from the word go. In the final analysis, it is not fair to blame them for the commitments that have not been complied with by the Nastase government. This list is long and weighty. Moreover, time goes on; it is fortunate, with the desired accession date of 1 January 2007 in mind, that the incoming President Basescu realises this all too well. That is why he deserves all our attention and support in this undoubtedly difficult period. This House expects the Commission to strictly enforce the security mechanism agreed upon with Bucharest.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish off, I should like to draw Bucharest’s attention to one paragraph in the Moscovici report: ‘calls on it to speed up the restitution of property and adopt legislation on the restitution of churches’. At the same time, I would ask the Council and Commission to closely monitor the implementation of this long drawn-out issue. The Dutch Presidency has already made a pledge to that effect to its own parliament. In a fine review in a German quality newspaper yesterday, I read a razor-sharp satire on the political degeneration of Romania under post-Communist rule. The author aptly parodied the title of Prime Minister Nastase’s campaign document entitled: ‘From Karl Marx to Coca-Cola’, claiming that a document entitled ‘From Karl Marx to Al Capone’ would be just as truthful. We very much hope that Romania, under President Basescu, will break this persistent political spell. The surprising outcome of the second round of the presidential elections appears to be an encouraging sign of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The countless young Romanians who have supported him over recent months and are jubilantly filling the squares and streets of Bucharest and the rest of the country are, regardless of their political affiliations, pinning on him their hopes for change and for a different, new and better future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Basescu has a difficult and yet rather exciting task ahead of him: to steer his country on the new courses of modernisation, anti-corruption measures and full compliance with human and civil rights, as well as the permanent adoption of democratic structures. We hope – or rather, we are sure – that the end of that journey can only be the total integration of Romania into the political and socioeconomic bloc of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While we note with satisfaction the goals that have been achieved, our task over the remaining two years will be to ensure that concrete, real and significant improvements are made in the many areas that still fall short of European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer in particular to the qualitative leap that is urgently needed in the field of human rights, especially with regard to the requests of the Roma minority, which often suffers discrimination with the acquiescence of government authorities. The Roma make up 2.5 million citizens who live on the edges of society in totally unacceptable conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also refer to the requests and aspirations of the Hungarian minority, which consists of 1.5 million people; the treatment of the disabled; the shameful condition of the health infrastructure, especially those facilities housing patients with mental problems; the violent methods and actual physical abuse practised by the forces of law and order; a judicial system that fails to meet the criteria of efficiency and independence; as well as media that are still not entirely free.</p>
<p class="contents">On visiting the country, I was struck and disturbed by the many – too many – children wandering the streets alone. We must demand a concrete commitment from the government on this issue. It is a legal and moral obligation, not an option. Everything possible has to be done, then, to ensure that every child in Romania, as in Europe and the rest of the world, has the right to a peaceful, happy childhood and the right to smile with hope for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He demonstrated clearly to me that the Romanian Government, through its Prosecutor General, had repeatedly intervened on one side – allegedly under instructions from President Iliescu – of the civil case against Carol's half brother, ex-King Michael of Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I was therefore particularly delighted at seeing the independence of the Romanian justice system. Not only has Romania now abolished the Soviet-era right for the state to intervene in civil cases, but recently, when the previous government tried to circumvent the royal palace's property claim dispute by a bill of compensation in the Parliament, the Senate threw it out, citing the fact that it was <span class="italic">sub judice</span> before the Supreme Court. So, things are improving in terms of the independence of Romania's justice system. Clearly, Mr Basescu's victory in the presidential elections shows that Romania is also moving rapidly forward in reform terms. The surprise result definitely scotched all the allegations that the election would be stolen by cheating by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is far from perfect and the fight against corruption and organised crime will be priority number one for the new government. More work needs to be done on minority rights, including the large Roma population and the Hungarian population. Also let me make a plea against a rigid imposition of the moratorium against foreign child adoptions, as many families from countries as diverse as Italy and Israel have developed bonds with children in orphanages. It would be cruel and inhumane to terminate the process arbitrarily at this late stage. I welcome the Romanian Government's decision to establish an international committee to resolve this delicate issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-President of the Ukraine Delegation, I believe that outstanding disputes such as the issue of territorial claims by Romania over tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea, which is currently under Ukrainian control, need to be resolved before 2007. Here, the ownership of the exclusive economic interest zone is essential, as oil is believed to be present. Good relations with Ukraine, which is now establishing itself as a fully-fledged European democracy, are important for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the border area of the Danube Delta, where there are concerns that a Ukrainian-built navigable channel is upsetting the surrounding wetlands and hence also the unique local habitat for rare bird species. More distant is the whole issue of cooperating with and stabilising Moldova and the Transnistria question that goes with it. Interestingly, if Mr Yuschenko comes to power in Kiev on 26 December, the days for the Tiraspol regime of Transnistria are numbered, hence the Russians' desire to deny Mr Yuschenko victory. Has anybody investigated whether the Tiraspol regime may also have had a role to play in the poisoning of Mr Yuschenko?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Romania will be ready to join the European Union by 1 January 2007 with Bulgaria. I welcome both as EU Member States, although I do not see the two as chronologically coupled automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, of course, there are the safeguard clauses which allow date slippage if Romania falls short of its requirements under the <span class="italic">acquis</span>; but nevertheless I fully support the Moscovici report and look forward to Romania joining us in the 25 Member States by 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with Mr Rehn and Mr Nicolaï, who I feel have expressed very objective opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania’s accession is beneficial to Hungary for two reasons; on the one hand, good neighbourliness, and on the other, the issue of the minority Hungarian community, with more than half a million Hungarians living in Romania. That is why I can say that it is in our national interest for Romania to accede in two years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Nastase Government, which has done a great deal to bring about the historic reconciliation between Romania and Hungary. Today we have a strategic partnership. It is true that in all honesty much remains to be done, but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress three key issues that need to be resolved. The first is genuine decentralisation, and a real devolvement of power to the regions. The next is the protection of the environment, as clean rivers are a cross-border issue. Finally, there is the question of the minorities, the Roma and the Hungarians.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to make the implementation of different forms of autonomy a prerequisite to Romania’s accession, but it would be helpful to open negotiations with the new government, namely tripartite negotiations between the Romanian Government, the Hungarian parliamentary party and the Hungarian Government, as was done in the case of South Tyrol and the Åland Islands in Finland. The European Union offers helpful precedents here. It would therefore be desirable to start the negotiations, and I fully support Romania’s accession without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ceaucescu and his associates destroyed the country, ruined its economy, fragmented its society and intimidated its citizens. The last fifteen years are far from being a success story as the postponement of reforms wasted several valuable years. I therefore hope that the newly-elected leaders, President and Government of Romania will set about facing the challenges before them with redoubled effort. There are two tasks that I especially would like to mention. The first one, where there are considerable deficiencies, is the social integration of the Romanian Romany minority comprising of over two million people, who are in a very difficult situation. The second one is giving a higher priority to environmental issues, since the state of the environment in Romania is far behind that of the other candidate countries. Regulations not only have to be adopted, but they have to be implemented as well. Let me remind you of the very dangerous mining project of Rosia Montana, threatening us with severe environmental disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The road that leads to the completion of negotiations is long and rugged, and I congratulate Romania’s leadership on their success. From now on it should focus on adopting the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. I hope Romania will fulfil the obligations and will become a member state in 2007. This is in our interest and in Romania’s interest. I therefore think that Mr Basescu’s demand that two chapters should be reopened for negotiations is highly risky. It jeopardises Romania’s accession in 2007, and delay is not in the interest of either Romania, or the European Union. Romania has made great sacrifices in order to be able to work towards becoming a member of the Union. I firmly believe that it is in our best interest that Romania joins as soon as 2007, and Romania must realise that several obligations simply must be fulfilled on the way. This is why I find this topic so crucial and ask the Commissioner and the Commission to continuously monitor Romania’s progress in this matter, as it is not only in our best interest but also in the interest of Romanian citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of the fact that it has been given very long transitional periods where important environmental regulations are concerned, it has not implemented different legislation. Where, in a number of areas, such legislation has in actual fact been enacted, it has been so on paper but not in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we sent a delegation from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to the Department of the Environment in Bucharest. The delegation examined quite a few of the more controversial projects, and our view was confirmed: the pace of reform in the environmental sphere needs urgently to be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a special project I think the Commission should keep a particular eye on over the next few years. It concerns Rosia Montana, a proposal to construct Europe’s largest gold mine in Romania. It is a project that will have huge environmental repercussions. Among other things, large quantities of cyanide will be used in this sensitive area. The issue is that of whether Romania will comply with current EU legislation, for example the provisions governing environmental impact assessments and the water directive. The issue is also that of whether Romania will successfully comply with the forthcoming new directive on waste from mines and its environmental repercussions. I should like to call upon the Commission to examine the Rosia Montana project particularly carefully to see if there really is successful compliance with the EU’s environmental requirements, which I consider to be minimum standards and ones with which compliance is also being demanded by the local population in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While not ignoring any of the critical areas in the process of Romania’s preparation to join the European Union, the report shows a clear appreciation of the notable efforts made and the results – albeit still partial – achieved by Romania in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, with great aplomb, this Parliament gave the green light to the procedure for Turkey’s preparation to join the European Union. I am in favour of Romania’s accession for exactly the same reasons that have led me to express my strong hostility to Turkey’s entry. Romania is Europe; Romania has a civil and political society based on values which, despite their undeniable highs and lows, have to be regarded as perfectly comparable to the values on which the European Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain areas in which basic measures are still needed certainly deserve encouragement and support. They include the multiannual anti-crime strategy, the state aid issue (a subject particularly close to the hearts of us liberalists), the sensitive question of the return of property and churches, as well as the modernisation of a judicial system that does not appear to be compatible with a society such as Europe’s, which is characterised by systems that are not subject to direct influence and control by the state.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just listened to the speech by a spokesman for a political party that voted for the accession of Turkey, who repeated the harsh remarks made by NGOs about respect for human rights in Romania. I should like to have heard the same observations made about Turkey as well: in that case they would have been decidedly more justified.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, absolutely necessary to call the Romanian authorities’ attention to the urgent question of illegal immigration. One Member has referred to the children, who understandably had an emotional effect on him during a visit to Romania. I do not need to go to Romania, because you just need to drive around the streets of Turin, Milan, Genoa and Rome to see Romanian children exploited by criminal organisations. We have to put a stop to illegal immigration, and Romania has to defend its external borders and actively collaborate in stamping out this activity, which does no credit to the civilisation of Eugen Ionescu, Mircea Eliade and the many other great writers and thinkers of a civilisation that we feel is close to us and which we share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons why we mutually need each other is because through accession, the underlying principles of the Union, decentralisation and local self-government may help improve prospects for the future of the Hungarian minority there, including one and a half million people. The question is about fulfilling commitments: will Romania be able to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis</span> that all Member States are obliged to fulfil? The Union seems to be more lenient towards Romania than it was towards those countries that joined in May. Mr Moscovici’s report critically examines how Romania has met the criteria so far. I would like to compliment him on his skill at compromise, as he included several of my proposed amendments into his report, making his arguments firmer. The report examines areas of severe deficit: the independence of judicial proceedings, the discriminatory legislation on election rights and the return of ecclesiastical goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this even a step further and point out some of Romania’s deficiencies in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, highlighted by the election-related abuse on November 28. As a Hungarian delegate, I feel obligated to list the temporary exemptions in the field of environmental protection that Romania asked for. Hungarians are apprehensive about these exemptions, as they would have a direct effect on the quality of water in Hungary and thus have requested that the Hungarian Government reopened chapters of environmental protection, which have just recently been closed. It is exactly because of the uncertainties of such commitments that I would like to emphasise how important it is to monitor strictly the period between signing the accession treaty and the actual time of accession. If necessary, the processes of the two candidate countries should be separated and they should receive individual performance-based evaluation. Regular progress checks are very important, and Parliament must also take part in this process, so that by the time Romania joins the Union, we can feel reassured and confident as to their preparedness. I belong to those who most sincerely hope that our doubts will be scattered by Romania’s positive performance in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has not always been the case, and so we have every reason to be gratified. Let us hope that the dynamic forces which have now been released will genuinely be channelled into driving forward the reforms and that the political process in Bucharest will not be obstructed. All we can do is hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a member of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee from 1999 to 2004. If we compare 1999 and today, the country has obviously made substantial progress. Notwithstanding all the criticism in specific areas, it must be said that the previous government under Anastase achieved a great deal for Romania. Major progress has genuinely been made in many areas. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the Romanians still have a lot to do. Not enough has been done to achieve the standards that apply throughout the European Union. I can only repeat what many of my fellow Members have said: an independent judiciary – which means a judiciary which is independent of the executive and individual political forces – is in fact a prerequisite for Romania's cooperation within the EU. There is still some ground to be made up here. I also hope that corruption can be combated more effectively. Corruption is robbery at the expense of Romania's citizens, and the new President has pledged major anti-corruption measures which will hopefully target not only the 'small fry' but also the big fish. Corruption must be tackled irrespective of position or status, for it is theft from the Romanian people.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it would be quite wrong for Romania or the EU to create new obstacles at this point in time. The negotiations should be concluded, and I would like to thank Mr Moscovici, the rapporteur, for presenting such an excellent report. 2007 must be the date when we welcome Romania into the European family, and thus integrate it into European standards as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It appears that this House’s rapporteur, too, does not have any problem with stating in the first paragraph of his report that Romania meets the political criteria, while going on, later on in the report – and rightly so – to express his concern about a few crucial points. The rapporteur goes on to draw the conclusion – which I regard as improbable – that a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations before the end of 2004 is both desirable and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">My common sense leads me to a completely different conclusion, namely that Romania has not gone that far yet and, consequently, negotiations cannot be concluded satisfactorily before the end of 2004. We have tabled Amendment No 7 for that purpose. Our Amendments Nos 6 and 25 are also important; Amendment No 6 underlines that the progress of all candidate countries is dependent on the assessment of their own merits and that it is for this reason that the use of individual accession agreements as a basis for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is recommended. Amendment No 25 does the necessary job of bringing paragraph 1 of the report back into line with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that we can count on your support so that we can get through to the European Council before it is too late, because it has just been confirmed again that the Council has now completed the formal negotiations with Romania. It follows that this debate and tomorrow’s vote are staged performances, but, before the accession agreement is signed in the spring of 2005, Parliament must give its express approval, and I do not see that as being by any means a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. I would see it as a good thing if this House were to speak out clearly about the premature and artificial closure of the negotiations with Romania, if it were to be able to put a stop to the considerable arbitrariness in the enlargement process and if it were to keep to the agreements made. The working method that we now see in the process with Romania will, sooner or later, result in the erosion of our community based on the rule of law and in the weakening of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, we wish to warn of the problems that will be faced by the EU if we accept a large number of countries as Member States in the very short term – poor and economically undeveloped countries with limited experience of democracy and the rule of law and with large problems involving corruption. The EU is constructed for economically developed countries with stable democracies and only moderate problems with corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement involving ten countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List was a sincere supporter is, already for its part, causing problems. Accepting poor countries such as Romania into an EU that continues to operate an absurd agricultural policy and a poorly managed structural policy and that is itself wrestling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">It might also prove dangerous for Romania. There would be a significant risk of a brain drain. Entering the EU’s agricultural system and being locked tightly into an economic structure without a future would also be a big disadvantage. The election that has just taken place was, however, a big success for democracy in Romania, but both Romania and the EU countries have reasons to wait and see and not to push for premature accession. It may be in the interests of both parties not to rush into full membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne did well to recall the position from which Romania started and the reasons that have made progress so difficult for that country. Even so, Mr Moscovici has also pointed out the limitations and shortcomings that characterise Romania’s situation today.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members from countries that joined the European Union on 1 May this year have called for greater severity. I should like them to reread what was said in this Chamber before their countries joined, when we were looking at how far they had progressed on their path towards joining the Union. In all likelihood they still had considerable shortcomings at that stage but, even so, it was thought appropriate that they should be allowed to join at the agreed time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Romania, we also have a safeguard clause, which was not provided in the other cases. I therefore believe it is only fair to give that country the chance to do its utmost over the next two years so that it can be ready when the time comes to actually join our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that there are topics about which our fellow citizens are concerned, the most important of which is the inadequacy of the fight against organised crime. If we were to ask people in the streets of our countries to say how afraid they often felt of criminal gangs, we would surely be inclined to encourage the Romanian Government to do more in that direction. As Mr Leinen rightly recalled, the fight against corruption is widespread in the countries joining our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to touch on the topic of children. This is a subject that I have addressed extensively in recent years, together with Baroness Nicholson. Child protection issues need to be placed at the heart of our thinking. I believe, however, that the proposal put forward by the rapporteur of having an international commission is a good solution. If we want to prevent those children from spending their adolescence and youth on the streets of our cities or shut up in institutions, we have to take into account the dozens of families that have already made contact with them and would love to be able to give them affection. Let us therefore welcome Mr Moscovici’s suggestion to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we need to consider the importance of stability. We shall see whether the outcome of the recent elections in Bucharest will lead to political stability. I believe that that is what we all wish for, because only with stability can there be any hope of seeing Romania ready to meet its commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I started my career as a teacher of modern languages, and when I was marking exams or homework I realised that I would become increasingly harsh as I went on, and that I would be much tougher on the last papers than I had been on the first – to such a point that I would take another look at the first ones to make sure that I had been sufficiently fair. Listening to this debate and hearing what some Members have to say, and also recalling this morning’s debate, I wonder whether we are not experiencing something similar here, because it seems to me that we are becoming increasingly harsh with each enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this to say that there are no problems? Of course not. I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they lie, and said that considerable improvements are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am fairly well acquainted with Romania and have had the opportunity on several occasions to urge those in positions of authority from all political sides to speed up work on implementing the reforms and transposing the necessary legislation and regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the majority of the members of my group, I will be voting in favour of the recommendations in the Moscovici report. I will be doing so not only because of my feelings for Romania, where I have many excellent friends, but also because, having visited the country as long ago as February 1990 and seen fresh evidence of the violence of the end of the previous year, I can fully appreciate how far it has already come.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe our friends understanding and friendship, but not weak or almost indifferent indulgence. This has always been my attitude towards Romania, and it remains my attitude today. My positive attitude remains fundamentally an attitude of vigilant friendship. I hope that Parliament will adopt the same approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am most grateful to Mr Lagendijk for his demand in this respect, even though we have arrived at different conclusions for Turkey. He is absolutely right: we must demand honesty in relation to Romania as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this obviously means that we must dispense with a few of our dogmas. The first is that deadlines which have been mooted at some point in the past are now regarded as more sacred than the progress made or the realities of the situation. Let me be blunt. We will not do ourselves any favours if we abide by 1 January 2007 as a date for Romania's accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am directing these remarks specifically to you, as we had the pleasure of discussing the budget, among other things, with you – we are talking about a period for which we still have no budget, as we have yet to adopt a new Financial Perspective to cover the period from 1 January 2007. If you cling to your second dogma, namely the figure of 1%, we will be unable to cope with this financial burden. We cannot argue that Europe is continually expanding and its agenda is becoming longer, while money is becoming increasingly tight. Please be honest and make it clear that there is no funding. We need to negotiate the Financial Perspective first, and then we will see whether everything adds up.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and again, let me be blunt – I have heard every speaker talk about the problems which we still have to overcome, not us, that is, but Romania, namely corruption, democracy and the rule of law. Just what do we mean when we talk about membership of the European Union? Is this not the precondition, as we learned today at noon? According to the majority of Members of this House, this is not the precondition for the opening of negotiations. I take a different view. Ultimately, however, before we are handed an accession treaty – and we have been told that this will be available within the next six months – everything has to be in place. We are deceiving ourselves if we proceed on the basis that monitoring processes and clauses which are built in but will never come into force because they require unanimity in the Council are enough to justify our confidence and convince us that everything will work out just fine.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am appealing to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the drafting of the presidency conclusions on Friday. I realise that you have a problem in that you have little to show for your presidency. However, no one is reproaching you: during the six months in which you held the presidency, Europe was operating below par. We had the European elections, and then it took some time for the Commission to be appointed and confirmed in office. No one can blame the presidency for this. However, you are responsible for ensuring that we do not deceive ourselves every six months. That means that we should not claim, in Council documents, that significant progress has been made and improvements have yet again been achieved when this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to you to be honest when you draw up the presidency conclusions on Friday. I appeal to the House as well: let us take an honest vote on this issue tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How does this fit with the decision to admit Romania to the European Union in just two years time unless by some chance there should be a deferral of just 12 months, which hardly seems likely given that we have heard today that the Council has overridden the Commission's concerns in closing chapters, a deplorable example of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> over principle of which the Dutch presidency should be ashamed.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my colleagues said that we are being too severe on Romania. How soft does she want us to be? On the Commission's own admission, Romania suffers from serious and widespread corruption; it has a judiciary which is neither efficient nor independent; it does not possess genuine media freedom; it cannot implement the <span class="italic">acquis</span> at local and regional level; it fails to prevent money laundering; it permits the ill-treatment of prisoners in custody; it fails to enforce laws against child and sexual trafficking. Yet this is a country apparently now so close to meeting EU values that we are putting it on a certain course to accession. It is not surprising that the EU may stand accused of being unable to say 'no' to anyone when it sets its sights so low.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner says, and I quote from his recent parliamentary answer: 'It seems likely that Romania's future progress will be accelerated by its accession to the EU'. However, neither he nor any of us know whether that will prove true. So far we have been lucky: membership of the European Union has tended to make bad apples wholesome but perhaps we will reach the point where the bad apples infect the rest. You only have to look at Lithuania, near the top of the world league for corruption, or to the United Kingdom, locking up people without charge or trial, to realise that Europe can very easily allow its values to be betrayed from within.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with existing Member States that quietly reject the principles of good governance. Perhaps the Commissioner can take a lead in building such a mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the new Romanian Government well. The results of last Sunday's election give hope for reform, although the result was no thanks either to the Commission or the Council, both of which played right into the hands of the former cynical government.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania's problems run deep. Once applicants are allowed through the EU door, the Commission is deprived of its best weapons to secure change. Instead of using the opportunity to apply maximum pressure to gain reform, we seem determined to set it on a conveyor belt to automatic accession. Romania should join the European Union, but it should do when it meets the values of the EU. It would be a grave mistake to set a date for accession now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that forecasts on the subject of Turkey are overshadowing both the expression and the weighting of our political word.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by referring to a topical matter, the finalisation yesterday of the results of the elections in Romania. The new President has been named and the results of the election have been accepted by his fellow candidate, putting an end to any disputes relating to the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the new President will have to achieve the strong backing of parliament if he is to honour immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union. Given the almost balanced presence of the main political forces in the Romanian parliament, cooperation amongst everyone and serious joint efforts will be needed for the successful continuation of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, by my reading, Romania has made significant progress, especially in such a short space of time, in coming into line with political and economic accession criteria. Nonetheless, we should not overlook the need for further radical reform, focusing on the efficient combating of corruption and changes in the public administration and in the judicial system, in the aim of securing truly independent justice. In addition, further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls, asylum and immigration policy and more drastic action to combat organised crime and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">At economic level, it is considered necessary, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to safeguard macro-economic stability, rationalise the role of the state in the economy and introduce efficient regional and rural development policies and policies for greater regional integration and cooperation with the countries of south-eastern Europe. My personal appraisal is that, with the support of the European Commission and with the precondition, of course, of more intense effort, it is feasible that Romania will be able to comply more fully with the criteria and the values and principles of the Union and sign an accession agreement at the same time as Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Candidate countries must be treated equally and fairly. Romania must fulfil the conditions imposed on it, just as the others did when they acceded to the Union. We are not striving for perfection here: none of the present Member States of the Union is perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems have been mentioned here today relating to Romania’s home affairs and issues of justice. Mr Basescu, winner of the Romanian presidential elections, promised the Romanians in his victory speech an unsullied administration and an independent civil service. This promise must be taken seriously and must be fulfilled. We have to encourage Romania to bring about reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise the importance of promoting human rights in the future. Attention should not just be paid to the viability of public administration: human rights issues are at least as important, if not more so. Trafficking in human beings is something for which there must be zero tolerance, both in Romania and elsewhere in Europe. Unfortunately, even the credibility of the present Member States suffers on this issue. We cannot establish a margin of tolerance for trafficking in human beings: it has to be completely prohibited. Romania also needs support in its implementation of the new law on child protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to express my thanks to Commissioner Rehn, as he has promised to keep Parliament very well informed. In my opinion, that is a very important point. Romania should be ready for membership, but the current Member States should also be ready to accept Romania as a member, and dialogue between the Commission and Parliament can only further that endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does this not prove that democracy is working in this country, which has suffered under both dictatorship and communism?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Romania cannot be compared to other countries, because the after-effects of this twofold oppression are still being felt. It will take several more generations before the insane decisions of a dictator and a secret police, the <span class="italic">Securitate</span>, cease to affect how people behave.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report does not mention the issue of the <span class="italic">Securitate</span>, which nevertheless presents a significant problem in terms of human resources. In fact, Romania has not yet emerged from this difficult period. Mr President, have we considered that the young people who were born after the dictatorship have not yet reached the age of majority? Where is this nation to find untainted, independent staff, who have not been close to the dictator, who have not belonged to the communist <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span> or been part of the <span class="italic">Securitate,</span> to fill posts in these administrations and thus ensure that they are independent, which is what we require?</p>
<p class="contents">The progress made towards accession to the European Union should be considered from two different viewpoints: the desire of the political classes for change and the ability to achieve it in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to delay Romania’s accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficulty, and I actually find it extremely arrogant. It is only 15 years since the revolution in Romania, which could just as easily have led to a civil war. We must therefore hope that President Basescu succeeds in forming a coalition that has the national interest at heart, rather than the profile of the different political parties. Although President Iliescu and President Constantinescu, a one-time member of this European People’s Party, have not managed to put in place all of the necessary reforms, we must nevertheless acknowledge that they have brought relative institutional stability to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us then, rather than playing the schoolmaster, have some respect for the efforts already made and accurately assess what remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, 2007 will in any case be a great year for Romania because in 2007 a Romanian city, Sibiu, will share the title of European Capital of Culture with Luxembourg. This proposal was made by the Luxembourg Government, and was the subject of a joint decision by the Council of Ministers and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The rich multicultural and multiethnic Romanian heritage will certainly enrich the culture of Europe, and Romania should also be seen from the point of view of its cultural riches and the potential of its population, which has been badly bruised by the madness of a dictator and the damaging effects of a totalitarian ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this morning I voted in favour of starting negotiations with Turkey. I am also in favour of Romania’s accession, and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality. I believe that our rapporteur has drawn the right conclusions in his report, and I am grateful to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the fifth round of enlargement will have been implemented, creating a larger, democratic Europe, which will take its place on the world political stage as a place of great promise and profound concerns, distinguished by being the Europe of citizenship. Europe is thus not just a free-market and free trade area with a single currency, but above all it has the ability and desire to peacefully export the model consisting of the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights, sustainable development, as well as an economy and finances that are efficient and designed to promote cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Treaty and the Nice Charter affirm. We therefore welcome the successes and steady improvement that Romania has achieved in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the various fields, as Mr Moscovici has indicated, emphasising, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, its respect for its minorities, both Hungarian and Roma. Romania must, however, make rapid progress to fulfil all the accession commitments, especially in the area of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural measures are not enough to combat poverty. Corruption also needs to be fought through preventive measures and all laws need to be enforced. Lastly, we feel that the improvement of legislation on child protection and international adoptions is a positive step. Regarding the latter area, I would call on the Romanian authorities to find an immediate solution to the problem of adoptions hit by delays, which are depriving children of the families to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of that universal right, which is one of the strong points of the Constitutional Treaty, and in addition to the creation of an international commission to start work straight away, I call on the newly-elected Romanian authorities not to waste precious time and, for Christmas, to give those children the parents that already love them and with whom they can build a better future in a peaceful Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have heard many positive remarks, most of which I agree with. Of course, there were also many concerns expressed, many of which I also agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">There were some critical remarks, with which I do not agree, from Mr Ferber, Mr Lagendijk and others, that Romania is not ready to close the negotiations. I emphasise that we, as a presidency and as a Council, base our position on the assessment of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is not ready for accession, which is why we feel it is important to have two more years to achieve the whole framework for the negotiations, as we discussed before, with extra guarantees and extra safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Lagendijk's remarks, we do not need unanimity in the Council for using this extra safeguard clause – the possibility of postponing the accession for a maximum of a year. No, precisely in the area of justice and home affairs which he mentions – as many members did – and also in the sensitive area of competition, we only need a qualified majority for using the extra safeguard clause.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Moscovici, Mr Meijer and others made some remarks about signals from Romania that the president-elect wants to renegotiate the results. The president-elect seems to have noticed critical remarks about the idea of reopening some chapters. We learned from Bucharest that Mr Basescu is emphasising the efforts to be made before January 2007, which leave no room for reopening the final results of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In a short reply to Mr Ferber about the financial consequences of accession, I repeat what I said about Bulgaria. The financial consequences are already arranged in the financial package for 2007-2009, irrespective of the new financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with my compliments to Mr Moscovici. His report addresses all the important areas in a constructive and even-handed way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Tabajdi said he appreciated the Commission’s objectivity and impartiality. I thank him for this and I wish to stress that in future this should be a guiding principle in all enlargement policy. My view is that after last year’s major setback we shall now be proceeding gradually and steadily in terms of the enlargement of the European area of peace and democracy. Our negotiations with the candidate countries will be gradual, steady, careful and thorough.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I understand in general the views expressed by Mr Ferber. It is a pity he did not have time to hear my reply. As Mr Ferber demanded honesty of the EU, that is to say ourselves, I agree that we should assess the effects of all decisions taken on enlargement and that we need to adhere to the criteria. It is for that very reason that we have proposed a safeguard clause in the chapters relating to justice and home affairs and competition. This safeguard clause may be adopted by qualified majority, which makes it credible, and it will encourage Romania to work and strive to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have also quite rightly given attention to the challenges that lie ahead for Romania, including improving the environment and the status of minorities as well as promoting the fight against corruption and crime. These are areas we continually monitor and will return to in detail when the Monitoring Report comes out next autumn. It is then that we shall evaluate the progress that has been made over the months to come. Romania’s new government will have a golden opportunity to demonstrate that it can genuinely fulfil its commitments and reform the country’s society and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Davies and Mrs Jäätteenmäki pointed out that the current Member States also have much to do to develop the rule of law. One can only agree with this. These issues, however, do not fall within the competence of the Commissioner for Enlargement. Rather, it would be better to address these problems via the infringement procedure or present a case using the machinery of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moscovici. I agree with the view expressed by both him and Mr Szent-Ivány that it is in the interests of both the European Union and Romania that Romania is ready by 2007. This in the first instance depends on Romania’s willingness and ability to reform the country and its society. The Commission, for its part, will give all the support it can to ensure that Romania strengthens its efforts so as to pre-empt the use of the safeguard clauses referred to just now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
