<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schwaiger (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the EU approach to the WTO Millennium Round is in line with the work of the previous Committee on External Economic Relations which adopted its position on each of the negotiating rounds in Marrakech, Singapore and Geneva with a large majority. The constant dialogue with the previous Commissioner, Sir Léon Britain, in 1998 and at the beginning of 1999 also contributed to many of the ideas of the European Parliament being incorporated in the Commission’s communication of 14.7.1999 and to these ideas being fully taken up in terms of content.</p>
<p class="contents">The main concern in all this was always free and fair world trade in the interest of the European economy and those employed in it. We are therefore keeping to the tradition of our earlier work. At this point I would like to thank the current Commissioner, Mr Lamy, for his outstanding cooperation with the European Parliament during the last two months. Since the new Commission began its work, we have been engaged in intensive and, I consider, thus far highly successful dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is about clarifying the comprehensive global negotiating approach from the perspective of the European Union, weighing it up and placing it in the political context of an overall strategy. The entire Millennium Round should be accompanied by recommendations of a specific nature which, formulated in accordance with Rule 97 paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, give us the opportunity to influence the work of the Millennium Round before the new Agreement is concluded, to play our part and to bring our weight to bear accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">A first series of recommendations could be made at the beginning of the year 2000 and we could return in detail to many of the proposals made recently in the Committee on External Economic Relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission should vigorously defend the full negotiating approach of the European Union in Seattle. In our report, we also demand that the Commission be successful in this matter and return with the right results. Our negotiating approach must mirror our importance as the largest trading region in the world and, at the same time, meet our responsibility for worldwide economic balance of interests, above all vis-à-vis developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What should our focal points be in all this? What is really important? Should the expansion of the world trade system and the opening up of markets be the main focus or should the defence of our European economic and social model, of the social and ecological market economy and of the Community policies developed in the interest of citizens and consumers take a prominent position? In my opinion we should do both, even if there is a certain tension between the two. Both objectives are of equal importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as was shown in Monday evening’s vote. We are now approaching a further opening up of the worldwide market. Tariffs must be further reduced and technical trade barriers should disappear. Our markets also should be further opened up to developing countries, in particular those which are least developed, and to the ACP countries. The understanding of citizens must be promoted and increased through greater transparency of the WTO rules and its crucially important dispute settlement system.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the obligations of the European Union under other international agreements, for example the World Health Organisation or the international labour organisations, must also be made clear and be taken into account in the WTO negotiations. However, we are moving towards the inefficiency which results from overloading the WTO rules with objectives other than the principle objective of trade liberalisation and non-discrimination against contracting parties. So, for example, the basic working conditions and social clauses which were adopted in 1998 by the ILO must be kept current within the framework of a working forum drawn from the ILO and the WTO and must be brought into the discussion and taken into consideration without necessarily changing the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">If we assume that fair and free world trading has been the basis for the increase in prosperity of many countries and their people, and particularly developing countries, then we must also realise that, as the largest trading power in the world, the European Union has a basic interest in building on this success story and involving more and more peoples and countries globally. For this we need allies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must link our interests with those of the pre-accession states in Europe, of our neighbours in Europe and of the developing countries, in particular the ACP countries. Furthermore, we need constant dialogue with the government, Congress and people of the United States, which will clarify our motives and build mutual understanding for a reasonable balance of interests with our partner. Through increased trade we will contribute to the extension of world peace, to prosperity and, if we organise ourselves properly, to greater social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent of our responsibility determines our strategy. It must be comprehensive, it must strive for balance in the benefits gained worldwide and it must be convincing for our partners. Market participants must have the easiest possible access to all markets in the world. The rules in force for this must be fair and must be based on the mutual granting of advantages and imposition of duties. The four basic freedoms of the internal market – the freedom to move, the free movement of goods, the freedom of services and the free movement of capital – must also be objectives which are valid worldwide. We are in favour of the conclusion of a Multilateral Environmental Agreement, which should then be taken into consideration within the framework of the WTO. In the area of services, which, above all for European suppliers, is the largest growth market, market access should be improved and new areas should be included, concerning which the European Parliament should certainly be clearly heard.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of the permanent integration and promotion of electronic commerce within the framework of GATT. The resolutions of the Uruguay Round on government procurement must be applied. Long term, a large number of the bilateral investment protection agreements within the framework of the World Trade Organisation must be replaced by comprehensive multilateral regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition within the liberated markets must become more effective and competition authorities must be set up accordingly. The European agricultural model of rural sustainable agriculture, which is based on the preservation of rural areas, the environment and our quality produce, as well as the production of foodstuffs, should be retained. Opposition should be met with reference to the rapidly increasing support practice of the US government.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a further word on development cooperation: it must be updated and expanded within the framework of the ACP Partnership. The world trade system is based, in key areas, on the contribution of Europeans and Americans. In the 60s, at the same time as introducing the common external tariff, we also adopted, in the various Kennedy Rounds and others, a consistent policy worldwide of reducing tariffs and opening up markets. The result was the opening up of new markets in third countries, but also the opening up of our markets for other industrial states.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, may I thank the Secretariat, our advisers and all those in Parliament who have worked together on this report. We had very little time and our technical and other departments worked magnificently.</p>

The world trade round is therefore exceptionally important in Europe speaking with a single voice in world trade negotiations so that social and environmentally-friendly growth can also gather pace through the contribution of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1990 there has been a worldwide increase in mergers and also the market power of transnational concerns. It is therefore very important that the Millennium Round creates multilateral rules against private restrictions in competition. An international competition system must create minimum norms so as to prevent anti-competitive behaviour such as the forming of price and area cartels, the misuse of a market-dominant position or vertical and horizontal competitive restrictions which distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of these minimum norms must be the obligation for WTO Member States to bring their domestic competition law into line with multilateral agreements and minimum norms. This means that the Millennium Round must not create a global cartel authority. It must, however, subject domestic competition rules to monitoring. It would be contrary to the rules of GATT, CFSP and WTO if free and fair world trade between states were valid, but not for private economic players. Monopolies and cartels damage consumers and societies. The Microsoft case in the USA clearly demonstrated this.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing willingness for mergers between transnational companies and the impotence of the national state with regard to the formation of monopolies, oligopolies and cartels endanger the objectives of world trade to contribute to prosperity and peace worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also particularly important that we realise that the decrease in growth in the world economy is also linked to the instability of the international finance system, which is characterised by vast, rapid and worldwide financial transactions and which has detached itself from the real economy, yet still affects investments, growth and employment. For this reason, the Millennium Round must contribute to coherence in the world economy between trade, economic, currency and financial policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the rapporteur has succeeded in sending out three signals in the report: to our worldwide partners, a signal of the resolve of the European Union; to our people, a signal for a human face to globalisation; and to our citizens, a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this resolution, the Parliament is giving the Commission full backing for Seattle. Our message to our partners is that we are solidly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle – as solidly as the European Alps, I would say. All the participants should be aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second signal is to the people who sceptically oppose globalisation. We want to give the markets a worldwide framework as well. We can and we desire to bring about globalisation. The market system will keep pace with its global development and so we are following a liberal and antiprotectionist tendency. The losers in globalisation or those who support it should know that they have an advocate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like to state quite clearly that this Millennium Round also has a parliamentary dimension. This is indispensable because it is no longer just about the reduction of tariffs and quotas; it is also about elementary matters such as social concern, environmental protection and fair competition. We should also make this clear to the non-governmental organisations. The place for political debate on the Millennium Round in Europe is the European Parliament. The governments are not negotiating this with non-governmental organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each of us who has recently had anything to do with the non-governmental organisations has had to constantly hear that the major liberalisation step since the Uruguay Round has not been the absolute <span class="italic">non plus ultra</span>. And quite right! There is greater dissatisfaction among the poorer countries because people are wondering where all the promised prosperity has gone, who has cashed in and how the poor have become even poorer. This is shown by the facts of the UNCTAD and OECD reports. This should not be the case!</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for me at this time to elaborate on the advantages which we will gain from the next liberalisation step. That will be done by my colleagues. It is my job to point out previous failings and our inability to provide social balance in the world. For this reason, we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs naturally stand up primarily for the personal situation of those affected and for their rights and bring this to the debate. This is of particular importance in the poorer countries especially; countries which have a worse democratic/political tendency. We want free world trade to be tied in with the basic questions of future policy, our future, the questions of social harmony and environmental concerns. We do not want to support any new protectionism – absolutely not; rather, we want the seven core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation to also be guaranteed for workers in the ACP and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Why the seven core Labour Standards? These seven core Labour Standards are based on the four basic human rights in the workplace; the right of association and to organise freely and unhindered, the right to form trade unions, the right to freedom from forced labour and the right to a childhood. We still have five-year olds standing or sitting at the loom whilst their parents have no work. This is nothing new! Or the right not to suffer discrimination on grounds of sex, religion, political persuasion or national or ethical background. We want these rights to also be afforded to workers in the poorer countries. At this very time when new partners such as China are joining us within the framework of the WTO, this is of particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have been speaking about is the real concern of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, namely to provide the workers of these countries with a tool to defend themselves, the right to be able to defend themselves. This in itself can provide more social balance. This, Commissioner, also belongs on the negotiating table and is our concern.</p>

These are of course areas – and I shall mention a few of them – determined by the Environment Committee where, in the past, we have found deficiencies, areas where there are loopholes, areas where we noticed snags and catches. I will now mention a few of the most important of these areas which the Environment Committee has determined and which it considers to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, as regards the precautionary principle, this must be clearly defined and we must have a definition as adopted at the Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio. This precautionary principle must be anchored in the WTO rules and regulations in a legally binding manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it must be possible to implement, for example, the Multilateral Environment Agreement without triggering conflicts with the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the issue of providing information to consumers on preparation and production methods, commonly referred to as PPMs, and the possibility for Member States to take non-discriminatory measures. These issues must be included in the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say something on the dispute settlement procedure. The dispute settlement procedure, with which we have always had so many problems in the past, and many dispute procedures which we did have concerned the areas of environmental policy, consumer protection and animal protection, must become more transparent. It must ensure that scientific expertise is independent and unambiguous and then it must also be recognised. It must not be the case, as with hormones, that the European Union is able to provide scientific expertise on the danger of hormones whilst we are obliged to pay compensation. Such situations must not be repeated in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only mentioned a few of the most important points which my colleagues designate time and again as being important, because everyone will keep saying that in the World Trade Organisation environmental issues and consumer protection issues must be cited as a central theme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, and this does not go without saying and is not always the case, for incorporating many of the points which were determined in the Environment Committee in the final report, for including them in the amendments of the rapporteur and in the compromise amendments so that much of what the Environment Committee considers important for Seattle has been taken up in the report of Mr Schwaiger.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamy, I therefore now ask you and the Commission to take up these points which I have mentioned here, and also more comprehensive points, to cement these basic points in the opening round and to ensure that in the Millennium Round in the coming years we can further develop them so that the World Trade Organisation is what we would like it to be – a social, just, environmentally-friendly trade organisation which allows us to conduct trade whilst allowing our people and our environment to exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, I would like to highlight four points for the forthcoming negotiations. Firstly, we must preserve the European farm model, which authorises precisely the plurality of functions that agriculture performs for society and which would be threatened if excessive liberalisation of the food processing industry were to take place. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must establish a set of rules which are common to everyone with regard to areas currently not covered or insufficiently covered by the Marrakech Agreement, examples of which are health and hygiene standards, the effects on the environment and on health caused by certain methods of intensive production and the respect for consumers’ feelings. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must ensure that the designations of origin of the Community’s traditional products are respected so that we do not see more of the real piracy that is taking place with impunity with regard to Community brand names, as is happening in South Africa, as a matter of fact, with regard to Port, Sherry, Ouzo and Grappa. As far as this is concerned, I think that the decision taken on Monday 15 November by the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs constitutes a dangerous retreat and a dangerous act of hesitation in view of the negotiations that are about to take place. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to ensure that all subsidies allocated to the agricultural policies’ different objectives are classified according to the same criteria. A scenario that must not be repeated, for example, is the classification of European export restrictions as yellow box, as a result of which, they have to be reduced in six years, whereas American export credits, which are exactly the same, are not subjected to any restrictions at all. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is important to mention the fact that the Europeans have, for a while, been taking a more offensive stand in the negotiations on the WTO’s agricultural project. Firstly, because we have implemented two major reforms in the space of seven years – a huge effort – and secondly, because unlike the sacrifices European farmers have been forced to make, the United States of America has increased its subsidies by USD 15 billion in the last two years in blatant contradiction of the line of arrogant propaganda that they are currently taking against the CAP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport takes the view that as regards Seattle we need a holistic approach to audiovisual services. In Europe, the audiovisual services involve the cultural industries and also have a huge impact on our economy. Our cultural industries have nevertheless been seen, as I said last month, as an addendum to many of the serious trade issues that are going to be discussed at Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that we must grasp the nettle and acknowledge that cultural industries are no longer an addendum to these discussions. They will in fact occupy a pivotal position, a pivotal role in the world economy and as such should be treated as a driver of the economy rather than as an afterthought. Now given this, the Committee on Culture thinks it is particularly important that the structural framework in which we now operate should be seriously examined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important nevertheless, given some of the incapacities and deficiencies that exist in the world market, that we maintain the position adopted at the Uruguay Round. This is in order to give us an even playing field across the world market, in terms of the cultural industry. While we maintain that it is important to look at the intermediate and the long term and to look at the way in which the networks are now impacting across different sectors, the complexity of these networks means that we also need to look at new instruments to deal with the global economy insofar as the structural industries are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I join in the praise for the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, who has put much work into this excellent report. As draftsman for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, my interest is naturally on the effect a new WTO round will have on developing nations.</p>
<p class="contents">A week ago I was convinced that, with hard bargaining, there was some hope a deal could be struck to give a fair balance between providing reasonable protection to the EU industries and agriculture on the one hand and market access for developing countries’ goods on the other. Now that an agreement has been reached between the USA and China, I wonder what chance small nations like Lesotho or Swaziland have in a globalised free trade market. Only strong regional cooperation will give them a chance of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">This round on liberalisation of trade takes place at a time when the gap between developed and less-developed countries is continuing to grow. In fact, for large numbers of people in the least-developed countries, there are no benefits. The agenda of the Millennium Round comprises only agriculture and services, but the Commission rightly wants a much more comprehensive round.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agriculture is concerned, the EU will be unable to avoid further concessions in market access. The EU cannot pay compensation to its agricultural producers and at the same time block market access for third countries. But, in return, the developing countries must improve their core environmental standards and accept that this is not yet another form of protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Development Committee wants to see WTO rules that do not hamper eco-labelling schemes and green public purchasing. It also calls for a joint standing working party on trade, globalisation and labour issues to be set up by the ILO and the WTO. It calls for an in-depth revision of the TRIPS Agreement and stresses that the patenting of life must definitely be excluded from the TRIPS Agreement. It wants to see animal welfare included in discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must not be bullied by the USA into accepting an agreement that is detrimental to the developing world. US domination of the WTO must end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want a broadly based round, increased liberalisation of world trade and, in particular, strengthening of the rule-based system. We want to take the interests of developing countries into account and pay special attention to environmental issues and the fundamental rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important for the Commission and the Council to have the support of Parliament for these aims. I would also like to say here that the Commission and Mr Lamy have done much excellent work to prepare us for the WTO round. However, in this connection, I do think that it would be most appropriate to attempt to offer a brief explanation on the current situation in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual drafting of the ministerial decision for Seattle has at last got under way. The various sections of the decision are being examined daily in Geneva. Each subject is discussed at the Directors’ meeting chaired by Mr Mchumo, Chairman of the WTO General Council, and at the restricted ‘green room’ meetings chaired by Director-General Moore. To speed up the preparations, meetings of technical experts have also begun. The EU, under the leadership of the Commission, for its part, has had talks in a smaller group which has produced texts as alternatives to the main points in the ministerial decision. This is a decisive time for the preparations. There are twelve days left until the commencement of the Seattle meeting. We only have until Friday or the weekend to work on the decision. The aim is to have a Seattle draft decision with as few points as possible in parentheses or open for discussion. It is to be supposed, however, that many decisions will remain to be taken at the Ministerial Conference itself. No significant breakthroughs have yet been made regarding the wording of the decision. The Ministerial Conference at Lausanne and the meeting between Mr Clinton and Mr Prodi a couple of weeks ago did not provide the political impetus for the preparations that was hoped for. It must be admitted that, although in general a crisis is needed in trade talks before any significant breakthroughs are achieved, the situation in Geneva is, at present, more difficult than anticipated. I must say that I am genuinely concerned about the situation as it is at present.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still very great differences of opinion regarding the main question: the overall extent of the round. The EU and ten or so other WTO members are still very much alone in their call for a broadly based round of talks. Most of the WTO members seem to be satisfied with a more condensed agenda, to include, in addition to issues of agriculture and services, access to the markets for industrial products, and one or two other matters. Agriculture will be the most difficult area in the talks, and the one that is most likely to end in deadlock. The Cairns countries and the USA are calling on the EU to show greater flexibility in agriculture for them to agree to a mandate for a broadly based round. To make headway in the debate on this subject we require flexibility on all sides – including ourselves in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter that has proved a difficult area of negotiation concerns the implementation of the agreements made at the Uruguay round. There would seem to be even greater consensus among the WTO members that the proposals on implementation should be divided, on the one hand, into those questions that can be resolved at Seattle and, on the other, those for which a post-Seattle agenda is necessary. At present the broadest consensus would appear to be on the issue of least developed countries. Likewise, consensus among the Member States is growing in the areas of trade in services and intellectual property. Regarding the so-called new subject areas, the negotiation position is still completely open. There has been an attempt not to totally exclude talks on investment and competition, but instead the working parties set up should, by the next meeting of ministers, determine what opportunities there will be to discuss these subjects. New subjects would not, however, be included in the negotiations package.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s proposal for standards for working life did not receive the backing of the WTO members in the General Council. Only the USA supported it. A good number of the members want to keep to the decisions of the meeting of ministers at Singapore. It remains to be seen how the issue at Geneva will progress, and what sort of decision, if any, can be expected at Seattle. The EU has not finally made up its mind whether to include workers’ standards in the decision or in a separate decision at Seattle. We shall continue with our efforts to convince developing countries in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Something of key importance to the success of the preparations is how the EU and the USA can achieve better mutual understanding with regard to each other’s goals. As I have already said, the meeting a couple of weeks ago between Mr Prodi and Mr Clinton cannot be regarded as a breakthrough, although it did show a desire on both sides to try and reach solutions. What was important for the Union was the wording of the common declaration whereby agriculture and services alone will not guarantee the success of the round. </p>
<p class="contents">The work being done at Geneva thus continues at breakneck speed. The EU is still pressing ahead with a broadly based agenda. Bargaining over aims and goals in all matters we shall leave for Seattle. It is important that we maintain communications with the other parties – in particular, the United States. The country to hold the Presidency and the Member States support the work of the Commission to enhance the Geneva process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on Monday the General Affairs Council adopted the short, separate conclusions concerning preparations by the Ministerial Conference. In the Council, ministers expressed their concerns regarding the state of the Geneva talks and urged the Commission to continue with its efforts to ensure that there is a broadly based round. In the conclusions of the Council there is a reference to the WTO conclusions adopted on 26 October and a reiteration of support for our aim to have a broadly based round. Only a broadly based round will guarantee a fair outcome for all members. In addition, the Council stressed the need to be open to the proposals of other countries, especially those from developing countries. The Member States also gave their support to the Commission in the last-minute preparations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what about increasing quality of life, participation in growth development and the creation of new, socially acceptable jobs? In order to reduce the gap between the worst and best developed national economies there must also be agreed social and environmental standards as well as consumer and health protection. This is not a playground for illusionists; in fact, the opposite. Here we are trying to gain the acceptance of the general public. We must succeed in making an exception of those states which, for the sake of short-term gains, permit or even induce production which is damaging to the environment and cements social grievances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is agreed that states which meet basic social and environmental standards should be especially protected during integration into the world economy. We must bring about a situation where it becomes more difficult to sell products unless they have markings such as “resources obtained with care” or “produced in an environmentally-friendly manner” or “guaranteed not manufactured by children”. We want to persuade consumers to prefer such products. The WTO rules and regulations must be amended such that these voluntary declarations may no longer be hindered.</p>
<p class="contents">Two further points belong on the agenda in Seattle: firstly, investment agreements on the basis of the ILO declaration on multinational companies and the corresponding OECD guidelines in which workers’ rights are taken into account; secondly, the setting up of a permanent forum between the WTO and the ILO to consider the acceptance of basic workers’ rights, i.e. the abolition of forced and slave labour, the outlawing of child labour and prohibition of discrimination. The excellent report by Konrad Schwaiger, which deserves consensus and a majority, makes clear that this is about more than just trade policy; it is about the participation of all countries on the basis of equal rights, social progress and the enforcement of human rights.</p>

He has shown great openness which has, in turn, lead to us putting forward compromises which are not really compromises in the sense that they do not negate positions defended by individual groups; rather, we have genuinely fought and wrestled to find a European compromise, a European formulation which fully supports the position of the Council and of the Commission. This is what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for pointing out the overall difficulties which exist in opening this new negotiating round in Seattle. We ought to be realistic and not fool ourselves: it will not be easy, in Seattle and beyond, to steer the course which we plan and hope to follow in Europe, particularly where it goes against the interests of our negotiating partners. Nevertheless, I wish you, Commissioner Lamy, and all those who are involved, the best of luck. I can assure you that you have the support of my group. We will give you our unqualified support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the difficult opening also means, and we should not fool ourselves, that the old consensus which influenced the interplay between open world trade and binding trade rules and which always assumed that there was an essentially positive influence on national developments has since begun to crumble.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in the rich countries, in particular the United States, which have profited most from open markets, the increasing number of international competitors within the framework of the World Trade Organisation has lead, ironically I might add, to growing scepticism and concern that globalisation is also bringing with it impoverishment, destruction of the environment and the loss of national sovereignty. And with the loss of foreign policy as a whole, the temptation is also growing to accept foreign economy as a replacement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group unreservedly supports the efforts of the Commission and the Council for a comprehensive negotiating round. Only this strategy can ensure that all the issues which have a European interest are truly given full consideration. Only in this way will it eventually become clear where the advantages and disadvantages for European states and European citizens lie. This is why we are also in favour of a single undertaking process. Nothing is decided until all the issues are on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary for the Parliament to be fully informed and involved. This is particularly important because so many issues, especially new issues, as many of my colleagues have already mentioned, are of an extremely emotive nature, for example, the issues of how we can include investments in the scope of the world trade round, new rules on competition, social and working standards and much more. Parliament must be fully involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens and non-governmental organisations and companies of the European Union will follow negotiations in Seattle more intently than ever before and will focus their attention on the questions of whether world trade is generally becoming fairer, more socially-conscious and more well-balanced and whether it can take into account the interests of every party. The feelings against an untamed globalisation process, which are marked by a basic scepticism, will come to the fore during the negotiations. It is therefore necessary for us social democrats to make clear where the opportunities lie and where the globalisation process can have a more positive influence in the future. But we shouldn’t fool ourselves: less WTO does not automatically mean less globalisation. That is an illusion! It means less globalisation which can be influenced. In this respect, I would once again like to make it absolutely clear that the Commission and the Council have our support.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, on his outstanding efforts in forging a broad cross-party approach to this hugely important issue, which will have consequences for us all for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR remains unambiguously supportive of further trade liberalisation, of the strengthening of the multilateral trade system and of a broadly based negotiation covering a wide range of existing and new trade matters. Our hope is that this report, when adopted by Parliament tomorrow, will serve as a clear signal of our political backing for a comprehensive round at a crucial stage in the preparations for Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament also has a central role in allaying legitimate public fears about the consequences of globalisation. In some quarters a misplaced view has arisen that the WTO is a malign agent for all the negative effects of globalisation. In truth, without the WTO we would be unable to construct the global legal and regulatory architecture which is indispensable to any coherent political response to globalisation. Without the WTO the law of the jungle and the power of might over right would prevail – hardly an outcome the critics of the WTO would welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons we have been active in tabling a series of amendments to the report, pushing for the development of new WTO rules in areas such as the environment, now directly affected by international trade policy. We have supported all efforts to strengthen the place of developing countries in the world trade system, not least by underlining the inescapable need for continued reform of the EU’s common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also pushed, and will continue to do so, to ensure the WTO is more transparent and the European Commission more accountable to the European Parliament in the conduct of trade policy. This must include, as a minimum, an automatic Parliamentary right to subject any WTO deal to assent and much greater access to the negotiating briefs discussed within the Council. At the same time the ELDR has resisted all attempts to burden this report with a shopping list of sector-specific requests. That is why tomorrow we will vote against those sections of the report which call for exceptional treatment for particular sectors. We must accept the consequences of our support for a comprehensive trade round. Comprehensive means all-encompassing; it does not mean riddled with exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on China. Late on Sunday night a bilateral deal was struck between the US and China on China’s accession to the WTO. China’s entry into the WTO will, arguably, have as far-reaching an effect as anything which will take place in Seattle. It is impossible to separate the question of China’s accession to the WTO from our wider consideration of the EU’s position in Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is in a delicate position as the last major WTO player not to have concluded a deal with China. An optimistic interpretation would suggest that Europe is now in a strong position to exploit and build on the concessions already secured from China by Washington. However, the fact that European Commission negotiating officials were reported a mere week before the US deal as discounting the likelihood of Chinese accession any time soon may suggest that the European Union has not been negotiating as convincingly as might be hoped. There is clearly a risk that Europe will now be forced into a corner in the talks with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR has always strongly supported Chinese accession to the WTO but not at the cost of legitimate European interests, which do not always converge with American commercial interests. I therefore call on the Commission to give an urgent account of the Chinese accession talks to Parliament, and particularly as to how they may affect our preparations for Seattle, so that Parliament can vote tomorrow on Mr Schwaiger’s report in full command of all the relevant facts.</p>
<p class="contents">With these important caveats in mind, I would like to confirm the ELDR’s broad support for Mr Schwaiger’s work and reiterate our warm thanks to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in his introduction Mr Schwaiger says that the goal of the World Trade Organisation is free trade. But trade is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end. That end must be sustainable development. So even if the volume of world trade has increased 17-fold, what use is that unless it benefits poor people and promotes sustainable development?</p>
<p class="contents">The uncomfortable truth is that there are losers as well as winners from international trade. Many of the losers are poor people who find their land taken away from them by large commercial firms or their livelihoods destroyed by new and often unfair competition from cheaper imports.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our Group believes that before we rush headlong into yet more trade rounds in Seattle we first need a comprehensive impact assessment of the social and environmental effects of the liberalisation that has already taken place as a result of the last Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need much bolder action to ensure poor people genuinely benefit from world trade. Frankly, that is where this report is still inadequate. We need tariff-free access for least-developed countries, not only for virtually all products – that is a phrase that leaves a giant loophole for the EU to continue protecting its own agriculture – but for all products from those countries. We need an end to the hugely damaging dumping of subsidised agricultural exports on developing country markets. We need industrialised countries to make legally binding their commitments to give special and differential treatment to poorer countries. But, above all, when we see evidence that world trade rules are destroying poor people’s livelihoods or damaging the environment we need to change the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say very clearly that free trade is not the same as fair trade. Nothing demonstrates that more clearly than the case of the Caribbean banana farmers, some of the most vulnerable producers in the world, whose access to the EU markets has now been ruled against WTO rules, as a result of which they face a devastation of their livelihoods. So, I repeat, if world trade rules are destroying people’s livelihoods and damaging the environment or animal welfare we need to change the rules.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a question of technical matters that might concern groups of specialists from ministries of foreign trade. This is also evident from the fervour of the debate underway in Parliament, although it is still weak in decision-making power, but there have been new events in recent years that are taking supremacy away from the specialists. In Seattle, at the same time as the governmental meeting, thousands of NGOs will meet, thousands of men and women from civil society who are calling urgently for the WTO not to become one of the seats of that global government, based on the growth and supremacy of the most unbridled free trade, which does not take into account the growing poverty of the population of the least industrialised and weakest countries, the destruction of the environment, the protection of natural and human resources or the differences and diversities within each country, all in the name of globalisation, which is continuing to create wealth for a few and poverty for many. </p>
<p class="contents">It is an exceptional fact of democracy that thousands of men and women have debated together and demonstrated in favour of a different kind of economy, directly linked to daily life and democracy, because the fact that 134 governments are members of the WTO does not in itself guarantee transparency or democracy in decision-making processes because, over and above formal statutes, what really exists is the contractual power exercised by the strongest governments and multinationals. Because of these fundamental considerations, we do not agree with the Schwaiger report, although we acknowledge his thoroughness. We would like the European Parliament to adopt a clear, firm stand to the effect that the right to dignity, health, a home, freedom and the elimination of poverty is more important than free trade and profits. With regard to the United States’ frantic rush to defend its own interests, we of course recognise that Europe is maintaining a position concerned with the defence of more human traditions, but we do not feel this is enough: it is not enough to state high-sounding principles – we must put them into practice. </p>
<p class="contents">Many things in the Schwaiger report are positive: the defence of our agriculture, cultural diversity and more besides, but I will limit myself, because of time restrictions, to only mentioning some of the fundamental issues. The issue of agreements on intellectual property rights is very important. We agree with the NGOs and many countries which have suffered through these agreements that there should be a moratorium to renegotiate them. Just think of India, whose legislation does not provide for copyright on medicines or foodstuffs; yet India produces herbs that are used by multinationals and ourselves to treat illnesses; or Mandela’s South Africa, where, in retaliation for his attempt to make treatment for AIDS victims more accessible, the WTO imposed a withdrawal of cheaper medicines. We support the south African countries’ request not to negotiate whether plants and animals or human cells can be genetically modified and patented, which would take money from the weak and make multinationals bigger. </p>
<p class="contents">We also consider the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety fundamental, because we do not want to be overrun with genetically modified food, and we therefore think it necessary to reverse the burden of proof and we consider that the experts must really be independent of the interests of governments or multinationals. We want to safeguard workers’ rights, the right to strike, and apply codes of conduct that this Parliament…</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Montfort (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, if the Commission had not already accustomed us to this sort of vagueness conducive to the extension of its own power, the Schwaiger report would plunge us into a sea of confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the thinking displayed by the Commission and taken up in the report offers no grounds for concern. There, one can detect only extremely virtuous motives, as on every occasion when general principles and noble ideas are being aired. However, it is the overzealousness which is demonstrated, and which the Schwaiger report faithfully echoes, which prompts legitimate suspicions, especially if we choose to recall that these same principles have only recently been flouted in connection with bananas, GMOs and hormone-treated beef, on which the European Union, represented by the Commission, suffered a defeat which came about so quickly as to pass unnoticed.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this recent precedent, and pending a proper assessment of the previous round, we thought it prudent to wait before throwing ourselves headlong into negotiations whose value still remains to be proven and where the rules of the game are apparently not the same for the European Union and for our main partner and competitor, the United States. But if the Commission is eager to commit the European Union to these negotiations, it is because, once committed, the Member States cease to be free agents. The Commission is claiming their support on the grounds that they have already exercised their sovereign prerogatives during the preliminary negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">What is the truth of the matter? The Commission has been granted a mandate which is already the result of an intergovernmental compromise. Yet it must be able to negotiate, and thus make concessions on that basis. How can agreements be reached? Is there a list of no-go areas and another of designated victims? If the Commission’s wishes are granted, the WTO’s remit will embrace practically all human activities and will create a world in which everything is an item of merchandise, including our public services and our culture. Can we seriously ignore the fact that the specific characteristics of our education, public health or welfare systems would not survive this?</p>
<p class="contents">If the plan described here cannot be modified now or in future, what strategy is the Commission going to adopt? President Clinton’s Trade Representative, Mrs Barshefsky, who successfully fought Washington’s battles on bananas, GMOs and American beef, has sought the help of the American business community, which has provided her with a 31-page document detailing the desiderata of their industries. Do we have anything similar to set against this? We believe that only the Member States are in a position to frame appropriate policies which would properly safeguard our interests in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate him on this considerable work on a subject as complex and polemical as the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Chamber we have already clearly expressed our concerns and reservations with regard to this new round of negotiations. I am, however, pleased that French demands regarding cultural diversity and social standards have been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, we share the concern of defending the specificity of the pluralist European farm model, based on family farms, which are often subjected to significant geographical and environmental constraints. In the face of globalisation, it is essential to take account of these differences which considerably change the rules of the economic game, with drastic consequences in social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgent need to establish a more democratic negotiating system, operating in a more transparent way, seems justified, in my view. It is indeed essential for parliaments to be involved in on-going consultation, with real respect for the procedures. We are indeed very concerned about the Council and the Commission’s remarkable capacity to withhold information. I also deplore the fact that the recommendations made to the Commission regarding small and medium-sized enterprises were limited to customs duties. All procedures for these small and medium-sized enterprises should be simplified, since these are the only businesses capable of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I appreciate the fact that Mr Schwaiger stressed the precautionary principle, in order to integrate environmental policies into trade policies, and I share his concern regarding the risks of a putative eco-protectionism which has nothing to do with the protection of citizens’ health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes no sense in this WTO Round to negotiate according to the motto “I might not know where I’m going, but I’ll be the first to get there!”. It is about citizens profiting in the long term from the globalisation and liberalisation of trade. It is therefore a personal concern of mine that the outcome of the negotiations should be understood and accepted by the people. In Europe today we have extremely high standards, both with regard to environmental and consumer protection and to social protection of workers. During the course of the forthcoming negotiations, these must not be dismantled, nor undermined. Our trade partners must be persuaded of the importance of these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the call to apply the precautionary principle and sustainability in all sectors. In the agricultural sector specifically, the results of Berlin must be the absolute lower limit in the negotiations since the situation of small rural family enterprises and of farmers in difficult geographical areas should not be disregarded. In the matter of social standards we cannot afford any shipwreck. I am therefore pragmatic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that in reality the contents of the 1998 ILO Conference will crop up. We should not make the mistake of alarming our negotiating partners with such massive demands. I therefore advocate the institutionalisation of the cooperation of the WTO and the ILO. Liberalisation has clearly had positive effects. However, it cannot be the case that at the end of the day the rich get richer and the poor get poorer! In this negotiating round Europe must truly speak with a single voice if we wish to assert ourselves against the USA. However, this voice must not just be the position of the powerful or of a few globalisation fanatics, but must represent the interests of the small and medium-sized companies which form the backbone of our economic strength.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
