I only wish that we could have sign language interpretation for all our debates to make sure that all people could access all the reports. The timing of this debate is very sad, when so few Members are present in the Chamber and, even more importantly, to vote later. It is very important to demonstrate our commitment to disabled people. Putting the report right at the end of a Strasbourg agenda does not demonstrate any commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I thank the Commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other Members of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I have managed to incorporate a number of their amendments. I believe that is one of the main reasons why we do not have any new amendments today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Year of Disabled People, 2003 must not just pay lip service to the problems that disabled people face. We need to have concrete outcomes. For a start, we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights-based model of disability. We must make sure that we mainstream disabled people; that all legislation takes account of the specific needs of disabled people, whether they are wheelchair users, someone with a visual impairment, someone with a hearing impairment, someone with a learning difficulty, or someone with a mental health problem. All EU citizens should have equal rights. I hope that in 2003 – if not before – we make sure that all of Parliament's buildings are accessible to disabled people – they are not at the moment – and that all EU Member States are aware of the problems that disabled people face.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall tell you a story about what happened to Jenny, one of my constituents, the coordinator of Access Charter. I invited her over to the Article 13 Anti-Discrimination hearings. She uses a wheelchair. For a start, she could not get into the Parliament's buildings in Brussels without going through revolving doors because they refused to open the double doors. I remonstrated with them. They unlocked them, took off the rope that was binding them and then 20 minutes later they were locked and bound again.</p>
<p class="contents">We booked her a hotel room with disabled people's access. Somebody had put a bed across the bathroom door and so she could not get in. She had to change hotels. She then went out to try to get something to eat at night, with her colleagues – remember she was using a wheelchair. No taxi in Brussels would stop for her. She managed to get to a restaurant. The manager then came out and said "You can't come in here. Your appearance will put off other diners." When she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search. She remonstrated with the security people. One of them said: "Have a nice trip. I hope your plane crashes."!</p>
<p class="contents">That demonstrates the problems that disabled people face and the real need for a disability directive. I hope we will hear the announcement of that in 2003. We have to have funding for major research into the status of disabled people. We have to have a study into the situation disabled people face in institutions in particular. It is essential that regional and local government are involved in this year but, more importantly, that organisations of disabled people and representing disabled people are involved in this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have called specifically for a funding increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 15 million over the two years. Particularly for sign language interpretation, for personal assistance, for accessible meeting rooms, for hotels etc., there are added costs; in addition, funding for impairment-specific NGOs is only for 2002, not for the year itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in line with the Article 13 Action Programme on Anti-Discrimination, I have called for subsidies for the expenses for special events at European level to go up from "not exceeding 80%" to "not exceeding 90%". We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language, and in accessible formats. I made my report available in all accessible formats at my own expense. But I would like the Commission, in future, to make available on request any report at whatever stage in accessible format.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the year must be the step in the right direction to combat discrimination. But more importantly, it has to be a celebration of disabled people's contribution to society.</p>

<p class="contents">The purpose of the year is to provide for a coordinated effort to change attitudes and to promote the removal of social and environmental barriers to equality and to assist in legal and policy developments. This means putting a value on diversity and celebrating diversity. It also includes making us aware of issues relating to multiple discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress our full support for the designation of 2003 as European Year of People with Disabilities. I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also supports the objectives of the year, as members unanimously backed my colleague's opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">There are approximately 38 million people in the European Union who have a disability. They face a wide range of barriers, including different forms of discrimination. People with physical and sensory disabilities are just as much a part of our society as able-bodied people. Very often, however, they are hindered from taking part in our society. What makes it worse, as Mr Andrews states in his opinion, is that they are not hindered by their disabilities, but by their environment and the attitudes towards them. They suffer multi-discrimination. This must change.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the problems include public transport and access to buildings, stairways and doors which are not wide enough to allow wheelchair access. Surveys show that the intellectual capacity of people with physical disabilities is very often under-estimated. They can be discriminated against when applying for jobs. The exclusion of people with disabilities from society not only denies their fundamental rights, but also deprives society of diversity and inclusivity. People with disabilities can make a positive contribution to society. Their experiences can encourage more tolerance, understanding and awareness of the needs of others besides their own capacities and abilities. Our own goal must be to end discrimination and safeguard their rights. It is important that discrimination against people with disabilities is tackled as a mainstream issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The four amendments presented by my colleague, Mr Andrews, were fully supported by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, and endorsed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. They are now Amendments Nos 20, 45, 47 and 48. I have nothing else to add, only to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her excellent report and on the very touching speech she gave to us in the presentation of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also speaking on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who is particularly interested in this subject and cannot be here with us today.</p>
<p class="contents">This a truly vast subject, as can be seen from the statistics: today there are approximately 30 million people suffering from disabilities in the European Union. This means that one European in ten encounters barriers not just in the field of work but also in access to public transport, buildings, private services, education and training – in other words, in all areas of daily life. However, there are other barriers as well, maybe less obvious but just as insurmountable, which restrict the freedom of European citizens with disabilities, such as the barriers to movement within the Union and to going to live in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">All these barriers too often prevent people with disabilities from playing the active role they would like in society, work, school and daily activities. We need a multifaceted strategy to ensure that these people are guaranteed equal opportunities in full respect for the European citizens’ Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one right which stands out above the others: the right to full citizenship. That is why our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote with conviction for the proposal for a Council decision on the Year of People with Disabilities – or, as we used to say in Italy in the olden days – people with different abilities – 2003. I therefore thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her good work and for accepting the 17 amendments tabled in committee. Three of those were tabled by us, and we feel they are particularly important because they uphold three concepts: firstly, recognition of the importance of the role played by the family at all stages in the lives of people with disabilities; secondly, promotion of a culture of solidarity within society, meaning an understanding that a person’s value is not expressed solely in terms of what he does or is able to do, but primarily in what he represents, namely a human being in all respects; thirdly and lastly, reflection on the concept of the quality of life of a person with disabilities, understood not just to be access to employment or training but also all the other aspects of daily life, in the family and in and as part of society, a quality of life which is genuinely high and equal for people with disabilities too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows hands, helping hands, joining hands, hands expending energy, and this exhibition is devoted to disabled people and includes work done by disabled people. At this point I should therefore like to thank all of those who give time, patience, energy and love and make sacrifices for those who need their help. This includes the families of disabled people, but many more besides. We should not leave them out in the Year of Disabled People.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I am glad that 2003 is to be the Year of Disabled People, particularly now, because for me it also shows that the Stability and Growth Pact and an aggressive disability policy are not only not contradictory, but also not mutually exclusive, if we are serious about the European social model, defending the dignity of all human beings and ensuring respect for human rights, which are principles to which we feel committed.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have much to do, however. We need more equality in everyday life. This involves firstly actually implementing all of the constitutional provisions. We need to move from principle to practice. Secondly, we need more comprehensive integration. Integration must not end at the school gates, but must also encompass working life and social life. Thirdly, we need disabled people to have the right to receive support to live the life of their own choosing. Disabled people must be able to decide for themselves how they wish to live their lives. Fourthly, we have to change the images we have, such as the image of a disabled person doing handicrafts. Here, PCs, the Internet and integration using the new media could be very helpful. With this in mind, we are looking forward to the Year of Disabled People, because we hope that it will sharpen the focus of our work and that we will be able to take further initiatives to eliminate the injustices and barriers which exist in our society.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Lynne not just on this particular report, but for her constant faith in and fight for policies for the disabled. I should also like to make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and enthusiasm with which it accepted the proposal for 2003. We need to make 2003 the year in which we send out a clear message that policies for the disabled are not just solidarity policies. They are not just humane or charitable policies. They are policies based on fundamental human and civil rights. The second important point is that 2003 should not just galvanise governments into action. It should also galvanise social and business circles and the scientific community into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments themselves should start up action plans for a package of policies. Transport, urban planning, special policies for the job market, education. Society should do everything it can, especially through the civil society and non-governmental organisations, to foster collaboration and take innovative initiatives which can be used as a basis for new proposals for the European Union. Business circles can also play an important part. Support for research and new product technology can bring about exceptional new products for people with disabilities and new technological products can be adapted to the specific requirements of different types of disability.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Lynne referred to the Commission reports, may I inform you that only yesterday I started up my new web page, which can be read by Braille. 2003 should be seen as a year in which we push ahead with European priorities, such as those set out in the Commission communication on a "Europe without frontiers", while the individual Member States promote their national objectives, which differ from one country to another, given that policies for people with disabilities are at various stages of development.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I accept most of your amendments, in both spirit and letter. I should like to highlight the following points: first, I totally agree that we need to concentrate more on awareness-raising about various types of disabilities and the fact that some people with very serious disabilities are victims of multiple discrimination and, of course, the plight of those kept in institutions. The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment. Access to the job market depends on education and we need to focus on this. The third important point is the need for all the agencies involved to work together. We cannot propose and implement policies for the disabled. We need to work with their organisations so that we can present policies in which they themselves are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that 2003 will be the start of a new form of collaboration, a new type of innovative policy at European level for people with disabilities. The budget, which is EUR 12 million, is small but we should point out that it is not for implementing policies but to back specific events of local or national importance, the main function of which will be to kick start societies and organisations. I should also say that we believe that it makes sense to leave the funding ratio at 50% of activities at national level because this will allow for more events while, at the same time, allowing governments to take additional action in a range of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">May I again congratulate Mrs Lynne on her personal stand. I should also like to inform you that the Council will take its final decision on 3 December 2001, the same date as the European Day of Disabled People. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, of course, anything which we added to the agenda on Tuesday morning was always taken on the Friday. I hope that it will soon be possible to revert to this practice when Friday sittings are reinstated, but I wanted to take this opportunity to ask when these items will be taken in the Brussels sitting because you did not announce this just now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
