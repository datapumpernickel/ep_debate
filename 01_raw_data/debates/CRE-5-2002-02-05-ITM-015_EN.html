<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martens (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, education is an important topic, and I am therefore pleased that the Spanish Presidency has selected it as one of the spearheads of its activities. This report is about developing the objectives which the Commission has formulated in the field of general education and occupational training.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Lisbon Summit, it was stated that the European Union was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustaining economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. This is an important objective which is also attended by the necessary urgency if we want Europe to be accorded a respectable place on the economic and cultural map of the world. Education is rightly regarded as an important instrument for attaining this objective. It is no less justifiable to apply all existing brainpower and experience. This is why I regret that the European Parliament was not involved in drawing up these objectives, was not consulted and can therefore now only react to the programme which the Commission has in mind for developing the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I do agree with the goals which the Commission is formulating: increasing the quality and effectiveness of education; facilitating access to education; and opening up education and training systems to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Summit thus wanted Europe to do more to promote the knowledge-based economy, sustainable growth and social cohesion. Unfortunately, the Commission report mainly refers only to the first two objectives. The focus is on new technology, expertise in the field of ICT, getting boys and girls interested in education and technology, etc. This is important in occupational training which prepares people for making a professional contribution to society. General education is broader. Not only does it prepare people for working life, it also has a duty to prepare people to function in society as people, as citizens. This dimension is missing from the Commission communication. The Commission is thinking of education too much in terms of the economy and the labour market. In other words, it mainly wants to educate people in their role as economic players.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about a future Europe, when we talk about a stable Europe, a Europe with social cohesion, then education has a role to play in that field too. This is particularly the case since education, notably general education, has in many countries been given a strongly complementary function in relation to the family.</p>
<p class="contents">Education in my own country, the Netherlands, is in crisis, in my view. There are too few teachers. The quality of education is going down, there are complaints about the level of knowledge of students about to embark on a university degree, there are too many regulations, etc. There is also insufficient funding. There are problems in other countries too. That is why I am pleased that consideration is once again being given at European level to the objectives of education and training, and that concrete testing criteria are also being formulated, with due respect for subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, where social cohesion and a stable Europe are concerned, I call for indicators to be formulated and applied which home in on skills that people need to function well in society. Communication and social skills spring to mind, as well as knowledge and understanding of other cultures and a developed sense of citizenship. As already stated, education also offers, of course, a preparation for working life, but must certainly also contribute to educating people into an awareness of democracy and of the notion of the rule of law, as well as helping to educate people into becoming active citizens who not only have their own self-interest at heart, but also the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the report must be seen in the context of other programmes which touch upon education, such as lifelong learning, mobility and language programmes, etc. Lifelong learning is important when we talk about improving access to education for all, not only for young people, but also older people, not only for healthy people, but also for those with a handicap, and not only for the native population, but also for foreign people.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with one remark about language education. With a growing, open internal market and with a society which is becoming ever more multicultural, the importance of a knowledge of languages is growing. This is why, in the report, I subscribe to the objective that all pupils should be proficient in two languages in addition to their mother tongues by the end of their compulsory education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is generally said that training is about filling in the gaps. The same applies to education. What we really need to do here, therefore, is define what these terms actually mean, which is not happening today. We must, therefore, also discuss the definition of the gaps that we want to fill with our education and training policies. Definitions of this matter are not unanimous; it could even be said that there is a profusion of definitions and that this very profusion reveals our political leanings and the values that we advocate, individually and collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, the greatest challenge of this decade is that of social cohesion. In a world in which everything is going faster and faster and in which speed of movement has become a factor in the generation of wealth, there are increasing numbers of men and women for whom the doors to work, to culture and to knowledge are closed. I would go so far as to say that exclusion is on the increase and that this trend is harming our various strategies for social cohesion, a concept which we are nevertheless fond of in the European Parliament. Consequently, the gap is continually increasing between a growing number of European citizens and what I would call the world of money. This divide illustrates not only the distance between the individual and the market, but also the confusion, the loss of meaning in a collective system within which there are two groups: those who make the rules and those who merely follow them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, urgently discuss the issue of the continuous assessment of the European social model and of the price that we are prepared to pay to produce this social cohesion, this citizenship. In this context, we must do everything we can to ensure that the decision of the Lisbon European Council, confirmed by the Stockholm European Council – which, in strategic terms, places economic growth, better employment and greater social cohesion on an equal footing – becomes a reality for all and that finally, everyone, without a single exception, has access both to the social skills required by citizens and the professional skills required by economic producers. I now call on the Commission to take my suggestion fully into consideration and put in place the necessary policies for social cohesion to no longer be the consequence of other strategies and become a fully-fledged, high-priority approach in order to safeguard public welfare, in other words, the harmonious and dignified development of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any case, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the Martens report, I would like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur on her work. I am not greatly opposed to any of it and would just like to highlight a few particularly important points.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that it is important – as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has also pointed out – that this report should address the issue of education not just in terms of professional training, of the development of skills which will increase our citizens’ chances of finding high quality work, but also in terms of more general education, of which school education is part in a wider sense, directing it towards a humanistic culture which – although it does not directly provide professional skills – certainly achieves that task of social cohesion which is our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The same may be said of the report’s focus on equal opportunities for all citizens and the possibility that European Community action might remove those gaps, those divergences and distances which, in our society, still divide those who have skills, who have access to a computer and information technology, for example, from those who are still excluded from this world. These are the main principles of the Martens report and I feel that Parliament cannot fail to support them. This is the line taken in both the report’s declarations of principle and its practical recommendations: it focuses especially on the need to root and ground these recommendations in the changes currently taking place in the world of communications and in new teaching methods and, above all, to facilitate the climate and conditions necessary for the need for a higher level of quantity and quality of education for all to be met. In this respect, all the measures seeking to actively involve teachers, students and trainers in the implementation of the programme are vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis placed on language learning, on strengthening the ties between the world of work and civil society, on the need to find more attractive images to encourage students and teachers’ learning and mobility must not, however, mask the practical root of the problem: the need for financing which respects the choices of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">To this framework we need to add a top priority action plan to assess and intervene with appropriate, effective tools in the tensions which can develop in the worlds of education and work where there are cases of discrimination, with the common desire to fight racism and intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, the Committee on Culture thanks the rapporteur once again for her work and calls upon Parliament to adopt the Martens report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for her conscientious work. In line with the goals of the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, it is vitally important that we enable the generation of young Europeans to choose European research careers and European scientific disciplines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that companies have to play a key role in training students and employees. However, before submitting the report we should pay attention to the following points. There seems to be a gap between the proposals in this report and the progress made by the Commission and its expert group so far. My understanding is that the Commission has already started its work on social inclusion and reset its goals on the Leonardo da Vinci programme by, for example, including older people and disabled people within its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">This is welcome. We look forward to the European Year of Disability in 2003. In addition to that, one should not neglect the efforts made by the Commission on cooperation with the candidate countries at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">While not wanting to undermine the good work of the Commission, I must say that more can be done. We should also underline the importance of encouraging increased integration of European Union, Member States and regional initiatives in order to make efficient use of the relatively small budget for education and training systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would suggest better cooperation between the different kinds of funding and an exchange of best practice, together with better dialogue between the supranational, national and regional decision-makers within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to see more attention paid to the lack of equal opportunities for all individuals to experience better European integration throughout their professional lives. There are possibilities within the budget to facilitate exchanges of experience of vocational training systems in the different Member States. I encourage this. Europe can offer better education for everybody. Parliament's report should not forget to underline that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a detailed and, I think, exemplary programme of work because it systematically links the objectives, the indicators and the timetable, thereby giving us a benchmark. But what we have to ask ourselves is, what sort of benchmark is it if, when it comes to the crunch, we shy away from a real policy of educational convergence at European level. We ignore the main differences, we are not willing or perhaps able to do anything about them or our priorities lie elsewhere and we use the Bologna method to set targets which every Member State has yet to meet. I have my doubts, which I have already voiced to Mrs Reding. Nonetheless, I think that it is a benchmark and we shall see in a few years' time how hard it is for some and how close others have come to it. But I think dialogue is indispensable, and not just at the level of Parliament. We need to find a way of formulating an opinion and a view before we are presented with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. We need dialogue at school unit level.</p>
<p class="contents">Teachers are strongly resisting indicators, at least in Greece. Most indicators are quantitative, only a few are qualitative, meaning that the picture we get will not always be the most accurate, and we do need the most accurate picture. I also share Mrs Martens' view that we need more indicators on education systems, not just training systems. And here the Commission proposal really is one-sided. I know we are all worried about unemployment, I know that we want to leave school with prospects of getting a job rather than joining the dole queue, but a general education for young children is equally valuable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following Lisbon, and as part of the implementation of the strategy established there, we have given new impetus to European cooperation in the field of education. The result is positive, because the Council and Parliament are agreed on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed on the following common objectives: firstly, increasing the quality of our education systems; secondly, facilitating the access of all to education and training systems; and thirdly, opening up education systems to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that this involves some very complicated work, the finishing touches are now being put to a detailed work programme of the kind requested by the European Council in Stockholm. The proposal will be discussed at the Council meeting on 14 February. It specifies the most important points in terms of achieving the objectives laid down and, with the help of the open coordination method, identifies how it will be possible to measure progress. Upon request, the tools used must not only compare the different EU countries with one another but also be used for the purposes of comparison with other high-achieving countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The views and proposals put forward by Mrs Martens in her report will, as far as possible, be taken into account in preparing the final document. The Commission is entirely in agreement with Parliament about the two-fold objectives of education, namely to promote personal development through helping people gain the skills which will be of use to them throughout their lives, and to lay the foundations required if young people are to be integrated into society and the labour market. Reporting on the objectives and the detailed work programme will take account of these issues, which are interrelated.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, recently expressed the view that education, training and research are the keys to economic renewal, sustainable development and new jobs. A knowledge-based society cannot be created without knowledge. These different aspects therefore need to complement one another. A prerequisite of being able to achieve such a situation is that we work together. The work in pursuit of common objectives has only just begun. In the future too, we shall have the opportunity to work more with Parliament and other EU institutions, as well as with international organisations such as the OECD and the Council of Europe. Together, we must obviously also ensure that the candidate countries are involved in the cooperation process, and preparations for all this will be made before the next meeting of the European Council in Barcelona. Specifically, we shall have the opportunity of working with all these countries in Bratislava in June at the meeting of the 36 Education Ministers. In conclusion, I want to thank you for this debate and for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
