<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonios Trakatellis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the author</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have issued extremely serious warnings, based on scientific data, of a possible influenza pandemic in the future. We are therefore debating a topical issue which relates directly to public health and, of course, from our debate today, in the presence of the Commissioner, I expect us to draw conclusions and commit to action.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible source of the pandemic – I shall be brief on this because everyone knows this – is the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 which, following recombination with the human seasonal influenza virus, may produce a highly aggressive influenza which is not covered by existing vaccines, which is precisely why there is the risk of a pandemic. I should like to say here that the Commissioner has already told us that he has initiated certain discussions and plans for us to produce the new vaccine needed and to produce it as quickly as possible, not in the usual six to eight months required, but much earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as the influenza virus – this pandemic – could spread from one continent to another within a few days, it is obvious that, in order to combat this pandemic, a series of measures, vaccines and medicinal products are needed; in other words, a proper master plan. How many of these does the European Union have today? The Commissioner is here to tell us exactly what provisions have been made to date for these plans against a possible pandemic. Of course, it is a question which we also need to answer in relation to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans must seek to:</p>
<p class="contents">- secure the necessary coordination between the Member States, and this will be done by the European Commission;</p>
<p class="contents">- avoid panic among the general public;</p>
<p class="contents">- combat any speculation, if larger quantities of vaccines and medicinal products are required;</p>
<p class="contents">- determine the areas in which movements have to be restricted somewhat, because of course the virus travels with people;</p>
<p class="contents">- ensure fair and universal distribution of anti-epidemic products;</p>
<p class="contents">- identify the population groups to be vaccinated as a priority; here, for example, I would say that we should have started vaccinating with the seasonal influenza virus people working with poultry, in order to minimise the possibility of one person carrying both viruses at the same time, which would be exceptionally dangerous, and consequently to reduce the risk of a pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we need to strengthen the Union's ability to react to an influenza virus, including with a network of laboratories, mechanisms and public health resources. The key element in efficient preparedness is the timely development and quantitatively adequate production of vaccines and antivirals.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the World Health Organisation says that we should have stocks of about 25% of the quantity of these medicinal products. Do we have 25%? I greatly fear that we are below this threshold and will suddenly find that we need to produce huge quantities. I hope, and the Commissioner has already told us at another meeting, that he has been holding talks so that we can bridge this gap somewhat. In addition, we may need – as I believe the Council has also said – some sort of solidarity fund, so that we can cover urgent requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has to be done. Another question – which you can answer, Commissioner – is how efficiently the early warning and response system of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is operating and if it is connected to other Community warning systems relating to the health of animals, food, feedingstuffs and civil protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must basically strengthen its coordinating role and we are here, Commissioner, to give you effective support in that role. You must be ruthless with the Member States which do not submit plans or which have submitted unsatisfactory plans. We must help them, of course, but you must be exceptionally strict with them because, as we have said, the pandemic is something we need to avoid or, at least if it happens, to deal with correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a comprehensive communication strategy. It is very important for there to be no panic and for there to be a constant exchange of information with neighbouring countries, inspections and random sampling of animals and, finally, we need to regulate everything needed in relation to restricting the mobility of citizens, especially in countries in which this influenza may emerge. Consequently, Commissioner, we shall wait for you to tell us what you have done so far, and we know that you have done a great deal, and what needs to be done in the future. We shall support you in this procedure so that we can have a comprehensive and effective plan so that, if – God forbid – this pandemic happens, we deal with it correctly, without panic and with good results for the citizens of Europe.</p>

It is indeed very, very important and I welcome it, because I see that we and Parliament are on the same wavelength, we have the same priorities and, of course, the same concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">As time is limited, I should like today to cover the most basic issues referred to in the motion for a resolution and the question and to add that I shall send Mr Florenz, the chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Health, a detailed memorandum on the various issues raised today, so that the House also has some of the technical details at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First – and I feel obliged to do this after everything I have heard recently – I should like to clarify the difference between avian influenza, which is the veterinary issue concerning birds and animals, and the possible influenza pandemic, which is a possibility which has been identified by the World Health Organisation, as Mr Trakatellis said, and for which we need to make intensive preparations, because we do not know exactly when it will strike.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of avian influenza in Europe – and I shall emphasise this so that European citizens hear it too – does not affect the probability of a possible pandemic. That is why there is no need for panic, but there is need for concern, so that we make the necessary preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that the European Union and the Member States have the best and the highest levels of preparedness in the world. Of course this does not mean that, because we compare favourably with other countries or other areas on the planet, we can feel satisfied or that we have reached the point of preparedness needed in order for our citizens to feel safe. There is still plenty of room for improvement and further preparation, even though I acknowledge that, since we last debated this subject in the relevant committee, progress has been made on the part of the Member States and I need to emphasise that.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are different levels of preparedness between the Member States and what is important for us is not to grade or categorise the Member States, but to put pressure on them – and my thanks to Parliament for precisely this support for me – so that all the Member States have a satisfactory level of preparedness.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I am in the welcome position of being able to tell you that we have in our possession all 25 national preparedness plans from all the Member States, which was not the case when we held the debate in committee. Of course, I must accept that some of these are still in the form of preliminary drafts, but that does not matter; they exist and they are being examined today, in Copenhagen, with the European Disease Prevention and Control Centre and the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are in the process of revising our Community preparedness plan, which was adopted in March 2004 and will also take account of the national plans and the preparedness exercise which we shall carry out in a few weeks, when we shall test these plans to see how effective and efficient they are and to examine how they mesh with each other and with the relevant Community plan.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of drugs – the question of antivirals – is concerned, they are not a panacea and do not resolve all the problems; they are the first defensive weapon which we have at our disposal. We have today at least 20 Member States that have ordered or started stocking the relevant drug and, according to my information, the remaining Member States are also moving in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, there are problems because the industry cannot respond at the moment to the orders which have been placed. I shall be in contact shortly – now that I have a full picture of the situation in the Member States – and shall be holding new meetings with the industry, so that we can examine how they intend to resolve the production and supply problem.</p>
<p class="contents">During the informal Council in England two days ago, the idea was also mooted of a Community stock of antivirals. Of course, on the basis of the Treaty, we do not have the competence for that, but if we are instructed by the Council, we are willing to discuss it so that – just as the World Health Organisation has stocks in the event of crisis or emergency – there is something similar at Community level. However, it is important that we advise citizens that these drugs are not preventive, that they are not vaccines and that they have to be taken on prescription and that individual citizens cannot treat themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the pandemic vaccine is concerned, and this is my last point, we need first of all to distinguish – as Mr Trakatellis quite rightly did – between the seasonal influenza vaccine and the pandemic vaccine, which does not yet exist. We are encouraging the Member States to increase seasonal influenza inoculation among high-risk groups, and we shall most probably examine this issue with the experts as regards workers on farms and in danger areas, but not – I repeat – for the whole of Europe. The Member States must define the high-risk groups, so that inoculation against seasonal influenza can be increased – I repeat – among the high-risk groups only. This will help in the way which Mr Trakatellis indicated earlier and it will also help cooperation with industry, by giving financial incentive – that is how the system works – to increase production and meet requirements in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the vaccine also needs to be created in the event of a pandemic once the virus appears; this is not possible now. However, as Mr Trakatellis rightly said, this takes six to eight months and certainly no less than six. We are working together with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the industry and making all the relevant preparations and we are confident that all this will cut the time needed by three months, which is a fairly considerable timesaving. I wish we could achieve more, but this will cut the time needed from when the virus is recognised by the World Health Organisation to when it will be possible to produce the corresponding vaccine by about half.</p>
<p class="contents">Four companies have already expressed an interest in commencing cooperation with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and I am confident that others will follow. However, what is important – and I shall discuss this when I meet them – is the finding that: firstly, shortages are starting to emerge even for seasonal influenza vaccines, and I want them to tell me how they intend to resolve this problem and, secondly, that in research for the production of the vaccine, we want the companies to coordinate with each other so that they do not do the same work, so that there is no overlap, so that they move in different directions at the same time and we can cover all eventualities. I shall therefore be meeting with the industry and I shall, of course, update the House accordingly, as soon as I have some results.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close here. Thank you for your attention; I shall, of course, listen to the debate with a great deal of interest and I am always ready to update Parliament fully because, as you know, you are the strongest allies I have in this endeavour.</p>

<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear that we have had a simulation exercise. As I understand it, one of the problems found was the overload of information. I would be interested to hear how that is being managed.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need for the public, who are beginning to panic, is clarity. They need to be informed and reassured. They need to understand the difference between winter flu – which is not what this debate is about – and avian flu – which is not what this debate is about, even though 67 people have died from it, all working or living with birds and poultry in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the combination of those factors which could lead to a pandemic flu, because it mutates from human to human. It has not happened yet, but our resolution must be to ‘prepare, prepare, prepare’! The key is clearly vaccines, and it is the new vaccines we will need, once we know the strain.</p>
<p class="contents">We need capacity and speed. Last week we heard from the WHO that world capacity for producing vaccines is only 300 million doses a year. My own country – the United Kingdom – is going to place an order for 120 million doses. If it does, then where are the vaccines for everyone else? It is not possible without a dramatic expansion of production capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">As for speed, six to eight months under the egg-based vaccines is not good enough. We need to look at the cell-based vaccines of one month and even the possibility of DNA vaccines, which could be as low as one month, but still need a lot of development.</p>
<p class="contents">We need that central supply to which the Commissioner referred, because it must be said that no Member State is going to give up its own supplies when the pandemic hits a less-prepared country inside or just outside the European Union. I believe we need central supplies under the Solidarity Fund which he and the ECDC can then direct swiftly to where they are needed, so that we can smother the outbreak and prevent it hitting the rest of us even more seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need that information from all Member States in complete form – the stocks, antivirals, vaccines, masks, the health checks at ports and the quarantine facilities – in order to know that we are genuinely prepared against this threat throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our populations need to know that influenza always has been a global disease, and nowadays, of course, there are additional means by which it can be spread. They need to know that the HN51 virus has been present in some states now for several years. We need to know that the pace of spread has not actually accelerated in the way that the wilder speculation about pandemics would lead us to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commissioner tell us, firstly, what we now know about the incubation period in the bird population, and whether there is any sign that the virus has spread to other species? It is not yet obviously affecting humankind.</p>
<p class="contents">What will the lead time for an effective monovalent vaccine stockpile be? The industry has communicated to us that it may take four years to produce an effective stockpile of everything we need to deal with the virus if it mutates in the way that is predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">In his statement of 12 October 2005, the Commissioner did not mention the importation and trafficking of wild birds. We have seen in the recent case in the United Kingdom that the enormous number of birds now imported into the European Union – some legally, some illegally – is a potent source of further infection. We have seen that. What can we do throughout all the Member States to have an effective control on these imports and, indeed, their ban? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have been warned that the world is facing the real threat of a dangerous influenza pandemic. Effective preparedness planning includes the stockpiling of appropriate antivirals, as well as implementation by Member States of the existing WHO vaccination recommendations during seasonal flu, in order to protect the public and at the same time increase the vaccine production capacity of the European vaccine industry. Additional investment is needed for the development of prototype influenza pandemic vaccines, as a key intermediate step towards establishing a manufacturing process and the characteristics of future pandemic vaccines. Last week, the EU Health Ministers recognised that no country can solve these problems alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the Member States have very different financial resources for stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, as well as for the national advance purchase commitment to establish national pandemic vaccine needs, we have to suggest an early mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund as a precautionary instrument, allowing for pre-emptive action to be taken in preparing for an influenza pandemic. It is our belief that the Solidarity Fund envelope must be used now for the Community’s centralised activities, including the strengthening of the European Centre for Disease Control, as well as for Member States that apply.

The major potential danger lies in the fact that the killer virus may mutate into a pandemic virus that spreads from person to person. This risk can be lessened by controlling the bird epidemic and reducing the chances of the virus spreading from birds to humans. EU-internal solidarity and the help we give to our neighbouring countries, and to those countries in Asia where the avian disease has become an epidemic, will have an important role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States constitute the world’s largest supplier of developmental aid. Now it is important that we help the poorer countries take action to conquer the epidemic among poultry, and it is also important that people in direct contact with birds are vaccinated against normal human flu, so that the bird virus does not get a chance to form hybrids with the human virus. We must help the poorer countries do this. We have to guarantee that the necessary drugs and vaccines will be where they are needed first, in order to control any pandemic.

Although we all know that the risk of flu pandemics is and will continue to be present, I have the impression that, in spite of the timely warning, the European Union as a whole is not as well prepared as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that the 25 Member States have their national action plans and programmes. However, the European Union needs a common plan, and I feel that we have erred in not having prepared such a plan. I would like a clear answer as to who will be in charge of coordination. Will it be the WHO, the ECDC or the European Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, the media bring information about new cases and about the countries where new discoveries of dead or infected birds have been made. I believe, however, that it is much more important to protect the population as a whole against influenza and to prepare a joint plan of action that the European Union can apply in case of pandemics. Some countries have adopted rigorous veterinary measures, restricted open-air poultry farming and banned trade fairs. The problem is that such measures have not been adopted by all 25 Member States. Infectious diseases do not respect borders, especially where there are high rates of migration.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be emphasised that not all Member States will have sufficient resources to purchase vaccines. I therefore propose that besides defining high-risk groups, we should also allow those that can afford to do so to purchase vaccine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it emerged from last week’s informal meeting held by the ‘Health’ Council that some Member States still do not have any real emergency plan. We ought to be aware of this, Commissioner. We need to be aware of it! There needs to be transparency, because it is up to us to make these governments acknowledge their responsibilities. The European Commission has to show that it is taking a firm stance on the matter, and I would even say that, on behalf of the general public, it has to go beyond some of its prerogatives in order to make sure that the emergency plans are coordinated flawlessly. We have to break away from this European schizophrenia, which says that the Member States’ prerogatives should not be infringed. What will people say when a pandemic occurs? Commissioner, no one will ever criticise you for having saved lives, but they will condemn you, and severely too, for having been overcautious.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, in the context of researching a new vaccine, the European Union needs to provide its financial support in order both to help develop the vaccines and to make sure that studies related to them are well coordinated, and to encourage mass production of these vaccines. I understand that this research also includes a section on paediatrics. As we proposed in our resolution, it therefore seems crucial to use the Solidarity Fund, in particular to ensure that the Member States carry out these tasks in full. Commissioner, I know that this matter is now Mr Verheugen’s responsibility but, when the pharmaceutical legislation was revised, we adopted a measure conditionally authorising products to be placed on the market, making it possible to save time. What will have become of this important procedure in the event of a pandemic occurring? I get the impression that it has been left behind in a drawer somewhere. We must not wait until the epidemic arrives before we deal with it. I am counting on you to shake Mr Verheugen into action and to put in place an effective system for authorising products to be placed on the market more quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like first of all to ask the Commission how it intends to publish the plans due to be drawn up by each of the Member States. Have any deadlines been set to enable all Europeans to read all of the plans made by each country, as well as the concrete guidelines that should be laid down everywhere? Exchanging good practices and decisions needs to be encouraged. Finally, in the event of a pandemic, who will have the say on which decisions need to be taken in order to ensure that the combined efforts are focused in the right direction, that is to say focused on prevention? What will the EU’s powers be, and how can we prevent the buck from being passed between the Member States and the EU in the event of a pandemic occurring?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has not seen fit to publish the amount of antivirals currently available in each of the Member States. I do not believe that this lack of transparency is reassuring for people. We need both to know what stocks each of the Member States has and to create a fund of the kind that will enable each of the Member States to have access to as large a stock of antivirals as possible. What do you intend to do in this regard?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we do not have a clear strategy as regards employees and other people who come into direct contact with animals and, in particular, with farms on which birds are bred. It would seem to us to be a requirement to have a specific strategy for these employees and other people.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, do you not consider that it would be useful to coordinate the role of the agencies in order to form a kind of group of experts at EU level who would provide reliable scientific information or, at any rate, come up with a consensus of opinion?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the WHO has just launched an appeal: before we think about a pandemic, let us prevent epizootic disease from spreading! Money is therefore required.

I have to admit that some progress has been made since then, and that may well be down to you pounding the table very hard. In any case, a number of Member States have taken the right sort of action. You told us a moment ago that all Member States have now presented plans. Whether those Member States have presented those plans, but have not disclosed what it is they have done, or have presented sound plans, is, of course, a different matter, and I would like to hear more about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers discussed this last week as well, of course, when they concluded that stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs was a matter for the national level alone. This is, to my mind, an unwise decision, since bird flu is a cross-border problem <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. In the event of a pandemic outbreak, there is no time for extensive consultation with countries that have done too little, to persuade them to take the necessary measures while there is yet time, while we cannot expect countries that are sufficiently prepared to suddenly make their supplies available. There is therefore a need for common action, and that, Commissioner, is where you come in.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need emergency measures. At the moment, there is no public health risk, but if there was, you would need to be able to take action immediately, for example, in the shape of measures with regard to disinfection and quarantine at airports for flights from the affected areas or travel restrictions. I am not confident <span class="italic">a priori </span>that all 25 Member States will be taking those measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that there is a need, not only for national action, but also for common action, and I hope that the ministers will approve your proposals for a common fund.

<p class="contents">The current threat of the mutation of avian flu demonstrates the role industry must play. Patent holders must allow the production of generic alternatives in poorer countries. We must also take urgent practical steps: an immediate ban on imports of wild birds into the EU, and improved bio-security, particularly in the international poultry industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In our amendments, we are also proposing that, as a priority, poultry farmers be offered common, seasonal influenza vaccination, in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces, as Mr Trakatellis has said. Since international travel is likely to form the key mode of transmission, we are proposing that there should be systematic virological screenings of air filters from flights originating in countries affected by the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a question to the Commissioner: will he rule out a mass cull of wild birds, since evidence suggests it is likely to be counter-productive, dispersing infected individuals and making healthy birds more prone to disease due to stress?

The pandemic threat of seasonal flu, which afflicts primates and humans alike, from the runny nose of <span class="italic">Homo erectus</span> at Cro-Magnon to insalubrious Napoleonic sneezing, is being met by the deadly virus of those bent on creating panic for the benefit of speculators and scoundrels. A vast gravy train sucking billions of euros from plucked chickens and terrified consumers, to swell the coffers of the multinational drug companies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a perfectly simple answer to the question – and I apologise for my frankness to my fellow Member and to the ingenuous Commission (whose good intentions I have no desire to call into question): if the risk of a pandemic with millions of working hours lost and vast numbers of human victims were a real one, those humans, the Union, the Member States and the Governments would not only have the ethical duty but also every economic justification for distributing vaccine free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us block the import of chickens, but above all let us take action against the hacks and charlatans peddling terror, who are responsible both for the pandemic of neurosis and for the criminal speculation which is ruining hundreds of poultry farmers and risking the jobs of thousands of workers. If I catch this deadly virus, I hope to take with me to the grave as many as possible of these fools and scoundrels who are inflicting this suffering on mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While this resolution is very much about human health, we have to remember that we have to control avian influenza in the world. It is not just a case of Europe closing its doors and it will not happen. All the Member States must go out and help those countries that have avian influenza at the moment, and I know the Commission is doing that. The key is to stamp it out in the world if at all possible. That is why I would urge more help for countries outside the European Union to stop this disease coming in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say quite clearly, as other speakers have done, that importing wild birds into the European Union at the moment is crazy and needs to be stopped, at least for the time being, because there is no point in bringing in disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Contingency planning is also very important because, as Mrs Lucas said, during the foot-and-mouth outbreak there was a total lack of contingency planning. We have to make sure we are ready and have vaccines available.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that at the moment not enough information is going out in the Member States to the poultry industry and to those who are actually running our poultry farms, to ensure that, firstly, there is increased biosecurity and, secondly, that they have protection from the disease if it comes into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be ready. We have to look at vaccines that are available, because it must not be forgotten that this disease can mutate into several different viruses. At the moment we are talking very much about the H5 vaccine, but we have to be ready with other forms of vaccine should the disease mutate into another strain. So let us prepare, let us try to stamp it out of the poultry industry and stop it mutating into a human form of the disease, because then the citizens of Europe will be protected.</p>

I am still left with three questions about avian flu. Last week, you communicated that you would advise Member States to have people who work in the poultry sector vaccinated with the flu vaccine. Whilst this is in itself a useful measure, because that way, it is possible to reduce the risk of mutation of H5N1 into a form that is transmitted from one human being to another, what causes me anxiety, though, is the excessively non-committal tone of a suggestion to Member States that they might make a recommendation to poultry farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union should learn from the previous health crises with SARS and BSE. In both cases, the Member States adopted their own policies, sometimes with opposite effects. My first question is whether the Commission can shed light on this as quickly as possible. I would also like to hear from the Commission what priority it gives to support for flu vaccination campaigns in the poultry sector in Turkey and Romania and what support is in place for similar vaccination campaigns in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the availability of medicines. According to experts, EUR 150 million would be sufficient for the preliminary development of new medicines to stave off the pandemic. Which products exactly will you be making available?</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final question has to do with the capacity for producing medicines and their affordability. Are you prepared, in the event of a pandemic, to suspend the relevant patent rights and data exclusivity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem is that these animals, which have been intensively bred with the aid of technology, come into contact with regional breeds or wild animals, which carry the virus without becoming ill in clinical terms. If the virus is then passed on to animals kept in breeding establishments, there is the potential for mutations and variations that can present a danger to human beings. This is where the provision of technical aid would certainly make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">What is, of course, nonsensical about this whole debate is the idea that we might be able to gain technical mastery over nature by doing away with it and resorting to banning the entry of geese or the keeping of animals under extensive farming conditions in an attempt to get on top of all this.

The adoption of a resolution on the strategy against an avian influenza pandemic will provide us with an excellent opportunity to take appropriate action in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that we will be able to take more effective measures to prevent any epidemic spreading if we implement the following suggestions. Cooperation should be established with pharmaceutical companies with the aim of taking special measures to produce new and effective vaccines as rapidly as possible, and equal access to vaccines should become a reality for everyone. Poorer countries should be offered financial assistance to buy medicines, efforts should be made to place infected areas under quarantine and risk assessment methods should be improved. Inspections, tests and analyses of avian diseases should be carried out, and restrictions imposed on international travel.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key measures that should be taken by the European Union is to step up the activities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in the fight against infectious diseases. These activities should involve the deployment of expert missions and EU representatives to those regions, mainly in Africa and Eurasia, where the risk is greatest. In its present form the virus does not represent a threat to humans, and unless further mutations occur there is no possibility of it causing a pandemic that would paralyse Europe and the world. Consequently, we should on the one hand take steps to prevent public panic, and on the other bear in mind that the sooner we start to take action, the greater our chances of bringing the situation under control.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of avian influenza also serves as a good illustration of the way in which the EU institutions should communicate with the citizens. I would remind the Commissioner that the Commission needs a special communications strategy, drawn up under his supervision. Furthermore, I would call on the Commission and the Council to act responsibly when issuing statements on the matter. These institutions also have a duty to assess the risk of the disease spreading and being transmitted to humans. It goes without saying that they should not underestimate the current threat, as happened in the case of mad cow disease, but they should also avoid scare-mongering.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress once again that Brussels must act with the utmost responsibility when issuing assessments of the real risk posed. Assessments of the opportunities available to us to combat the avian influenza virus should also be realistic. The Commission should lend its backing only to those medicines that are genuinely effective against the disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of them originated amongst birds and all of them mutated.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known since 1997 that the H5 sub-type is highly contagious, that it is capable of being transmitted to man and producing a form of influenza with a high death rate, but that so far transmission is only possible through contact with diseased birds and their excrement. The H5 virus has spread amongst wild and domestic birds, and migratory birds are spreading it all over the place. Furthermore, it has been communicated to mammals such as pigs and cats.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, there is broad consensus amongst health experts and bodies about the possibility that the A virus H5 may adapt to human transmission and create a new pandemic. I believe that the executive Commission has so far acted responsibly and transparently within the framework of its competences. Perhaps its powers should be increased if a period of emergency and a pandemic begin.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avril Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, over the past 300 years, 10 influenza pandemics have occurred among humans. The most recent came in 1968-69, and the most deadly in 1918-19: the so-called Spanish flu pandemic. Scientists have been predicting a lethal cyclical resurgence of influenza for some time, one that will be more deadly because of our low levels of resistance. Now, with avian influenza, they are recognising the hallmarks of such a virus. The medical histories of those who have died of H5N1 influenza to date are disturbingly similar to accounts of sufferers of the 1918-19 outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Since scientists first started saving flu virus samples in the early 20th century, an H5N1 influenza has never spread among human beings, so population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus would be universal.</p>
<p class="contents">The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes. Like most RNA viruses, it reproduces sloppily, its genes readily fall apart, and it can absorb different genetic material which recombines in a process called reassortment. When influenza successfully infects a new species, it can reassort, and may switch from being an avian to a mammalian one. When that occurs, a human epidemic can result.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it was first recorded in 1997, avian flu strain H5N1 has undergone multiple reassortments – more than 17 mutations – and evolved at high speed to the point where, in January 2003, the ‘z’ virus emerged. In late 2004, there was one documented case of human-to-human transmission of the ‘z’ strain of H5N1. By April 2005, the H5N1 virus had also moved to pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this rapid evolution of the virus that makes it such a potential threat. We cannot prepare a vaccine in advance or stockpile it. The total number of companies willing and able to produce influenza vaccines has plummeted in recent years from more than two dozen in 1980 to just a handful in 2004. There is serious questioning in the scientific community about the possibility of speeding up vaccine production because of contamination risks.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is important for us to be prepared and vigilant and to take precautionary action, with responsible risk assessment and forward planning, a lot will depend on the availability and effectiveness of anti-virals and vaccines and hospital bed capacity, which has been seriously reduced in all EU countries in the last decade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with everything that has been said about preparing the European Union, stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, and developing a vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commissioner the same question I asked him last time we debated this issue, and that concerns the rest of the world. What discussions is he having with his colleagues in the Development DG of the European Commission? This pandemic could hit the poorest countries hard as well. We should be talking to the WHO about not just a possible European reserve fund or stock but also a worldwide reserve stock of vaccines and drugs and possibly some kind of solidarity fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must prepare ourselves for a pandemic, and we must not be taken by surprise.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been shown that during the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1918, the disease claimed at least 20 million victims. According to the World Health Organisation, we can now expect a pandemic to cause the loss of 2 to 7 million lives. This is not panic-mongering. The WHO admits that the number may even rise as high as 150 million. In the event of a pandemic, the production of a vaccine after mutation occurs will be complicated, and we will be racing against time to save lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all European Union countries pay equal attention to the problem. There are countries that allocate national resources in a responsible manner, but there are also countries that clearly underestimate the threat of the disease and, in particular, its possible consequences. I therefore call for coordinated action at the European level. National plans for prevention and immunisation should be drawn up in cooperation with European institutions and Member States. Every Member State should have a highly effective pandemic plan. We know that the effectiveness and level of these plans vary. I urgently call on the Union to mobilise and release more substantial financial, technical and material resources. Many findings suggest that European countries are not adequately prepared; half of the Member States do not have a sufficient stock of antiviral medicines. Cooperation with pharmaceuticals companies must be strengthened in order to secure the necessary quantity of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, Dr David Nabarro, underlined huge differences in the amount of funds allocated for prevention and treatment. Thus, while the UN has only allocated 7 million dollars for this purpose, the United States alone has already released one hundred million dollars. According to Dr Nabarro, the UN would need at least USD 175 million for an effective programme. In case a flu epidemic breaks out, I am asking whether such countries as Japan, the United States or the European Union will be ready to put their resources and vaccines at the disposal of developing countries to help localise a pandemic or epidemic wherever it occurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Care must be taken to ensure the virus does not spread beyond commercial and domestic poultry installations in which cases of the virus have already been confirmed by laboratory analysis. The populations of birds living in wetlands must be protected both from the spread and from the teams of self-styled saviours exterminating them. The rules of sensitivity must be adhered to where cases have been identified, as must the rules of hygienic burial.

Your statement is a calm and matter-of-fact one, and, in that you focus on the protection of poultry generally and not just on the possibility of a pandemic, that will help us all to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself worked for 15 years as a veterinarian, specialising in the poultry industry, with the Organisation of Animal Health, and could well have something to say about a lot of things, not least the vaccination of poultry. Not having enough time available to me, though, I do not propose to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, a number of Members of this House visited the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. It has to be said that its 160 experts, who are active around the world, are doing an excellent job of advising you and the Member States. There is, admittedly, as yet insufficient provision for worldwide cooperation, but the first steps are rightly being taken in that direction; there is a conference being held in Canada today, and the WHO has met in South-East Asia. Much more needs to be done to address this problem at the point where it starts and takes root.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Bowis and others have already pointed out that a system of inoculation will not be enough to contain the pandemic that threatens us. Reference has also been made to the Spanish flu of 1918, which cost 50 million people their lives. What that means is that there is an urgent need for a change of approach where the production of vaccines is concerned, and it also goes without saying that we can work much more quickly with cell cultures such as MPS.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what about anti-flu vaccines – who is to order them, who is to store them, who is to pay for them? As these medicines keep for five years, there certainly needs to be a plan drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is that no reference has been made in this debate to Africa. What will happen when migratory birds reach Africa? The people in Africa, like those in South-East Asia, live cheek by jowl with their birds, and they are at risk of infection. Who has responsibility for this? I am quite sure that we share it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I would like to thank those conservationists, ornithologists and hunters, along with all non-governmental organisations, who have assumed a heavy responsibility for monitoring migratory birds and have passed on their knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate question is not whether a pandemic is on the way, but when. That is what should be the focus of our attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that we had a simulation exercise last week for smallpox. It was mostly focused on the possibility of a bioterrorist attack. However, the reaction is more or less the same. We will be able to see, from the results of that exercise, what the weaknesses are in the whole system and, hopefully, correct them in time for the influenza exercise in a few weeks’ time. The purpose of the exercises is to detect mistakes and weaknesses and correct them.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not mention much on the veterinary side because that is to do with the pandemic stage. However, I should give some information regarding wild birds. Today the Commission is proposing to discuss with the standing committee the ban on imports of wild captive birds to the European Union. We feel that is a precautionary measure that we need to take today for a temporary period. Our experts will then review it and decide if it needs to remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">On the solidarity front, the regulation has not been adopted yet by either Parliament or Council. The idea of that regulation is to reimburse the cost of use of antivirals or vaccines in the event of a pandemic. If the Council and Parliament decide that it has to be readjusted to deal with purchases and precautionary measures, then that is something we can discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">The international aspect is very important. I mentioned that last time. I will be travelling to South-East Asia – the most affected area – to talk to the authorities there. Nevertheless, there have been some developments. In November we will have the Geneva meeting with support from the WHO, FAO, OIE and the World Bank. There is no reason for duplication, but we must support the international initiatives that have been started by those organisations. The Geneva conference will assess the needs – financing and other technical needs – to meet this challenge and will be followed by a pledging conference early next year. That is the important conference, where funds should be pledged to support the most affected countries in this effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Seasonal vaccination is the correct approach, but it involves an investment towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and will at the same time help the groups at risk to deal with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of communication, it is very important that we maintain transparency; it is very important that we inform our citizens about the exact situation. Sometimes the media exaggerate. That is a risk we have to take. However, any suspicion of a cover-up or of hiding information will have the worst results and that will cause panic. I admit that there was some panic, but it was not the Commission, nor any European institution, nor any European government that linked avian flu last summer, almost as a certainty, to a pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time – as mentioned in your resolution – the WHO believes that the influenza pandemic will happen in the near future. It is therefore natural that people are worried. The only way to deal with that panic is not by not giving information but by explaining what we are doing to deal with this issue. We need both national and Community plans. Each country has its own peculiarities, so each country needs to have its own plan, but we have a Community plan. Last year we established such a plan, which coordinates and links the national plans with the Community in order to achieve coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">As to avian flu, we will have more outbreaks. We have to be realistic about that. We should not panic or transmit panic every time there is a dead wild bird found on a farm with signs of the virus. That will happen. We have the system and the legislation in place, and we will use them. The CVOs meet regularly, contact farmers and advise them about what they should do.</p>
<p class="contents">On culling, that is something we wish to avoid, but we have to take account of the safety issue. We advise that this be done through animal welfare measures regarding poultry. However, unless we have strong scientific evidence for such a measure, I would not support the culling of wild birds.</p>
<p class="contents">The daily warning system works very well. The European Centre for Disease Control is very active in this effort. Member States and the Commission are linked together in an effective way with an early warning system and are in contact and cooperation with the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday in the Council we also discussed the issue of compensation for farmers. Eradication measures are financed or co-financed by the Commission, but the compensation for loss of profit or market is a matter being discussed in the Agriculture Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a reference to Spanish flu, but we are much better prepared now. We have antibiotics, we have the health care system, we have doctors and other measures that we can take. I therefore believe that, with the right effort, we can minimise the number of deaths in the event of a pandemic. I will inform Parliament whenever we have anything new to report.</p>

<p class="contents">The threat of a pandemic is real. Until now, this virus has caused 112 cases of human influenza, including 57 deaths, all of which were confined to South-East Asia. Therefore, all measures for preventing the pandemic need to be implemented by all parties concerned in the area, from farmers to veterinary surgeons and, in particular, by hunters of migratory birds.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to minimise the risk, international coordination efforts and the implementation of a European preparation plan are crucial. The European preparation plan is already up and running and it will have to be carefully structured around the various national plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening coordination and transparency between Member States, and protecting Europe’s borders at the same time as assuming our duty of solidarity towards third countries, are principles that must guide our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a problem arises when private laboratories produce prototype vaccines against an emerging virus, because this is a matter of health and public safety. Specific allocations of European money will have to be dedicated to this area of research.</p>
