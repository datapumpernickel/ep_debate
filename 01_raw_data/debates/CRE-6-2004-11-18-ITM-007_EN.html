<p class="contents">We take a critical view of the position adopted by the European Parliament. There is a mental climate here that rejects any other views of principle. We therefore have difficulty in assenting to a Commission without Mr Buttiglione.</p>

<p class="contents">The negative view taken by Parliament’s committee of Mr Buttiglione, the Commissioner-designate for justice, freedom and security, was based on ideological considerations, not on an assessment of Mr Buttiglione’s merits. Essentially, he was discriminated against by the Left for having acknowledged his Christian beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe it is disgraceful that although Parliament prevented a man of faith, whose honesty is evident from the life he leads, from becoming a Commissioner, there is room in this same Commission for people whose names featured prominently in anti-democratic Communist regimes.

We regard this as a positive and are thus, in principle, supportive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for us there are significant problems with, in particular, the debate over the withdrawal of Mr Buttiglione as candidate Commissioner whilst at the same time retaining at least one other Commissioner-designate who was the subject of serious criticism at his previous committee hearing. I consider that this is a blatant example of discrimination. We find this unacceptable, as we do the pledges given by Commissioners-designate to endeavour to implement provisions of the Constitution prior to its formal adoption. This we regard as anti-democratic.</p>

His position of support for the attack on Iraq, an attack which violated all the rules of international law, was also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">During the October part-session I made known my opposition to the first Barroso Commission, which was in no way acceptable. If Mr Barroso had not climbed down at the very last moment in order to avoid a crushing personal defeat, I would of course have voted against this Commission. Mr Barroso has, however, made minor changes to the original line-up he tried to impose on us.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I remain strongly opposed to the fact that Mrs Kroes holds the portfolio for competition, as her presence brings with it the significant risk that conflicts of interest might occur. It is crucial, however, that a new Commission finally be able to get down to work. I have therefore voted in favour of this Commission, although I did so reluctantly.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with many of my fellow Members, I am now eagerly waiting for Mr Barroso to set out his political agenda.

What is more, following the example set by Mr Buttiglione in his statements, positions were revealed during these hearings which were ideologically outrageous and which violated the EU’s basic values, such as tolerance, cultural pluralism and freedom of thought.</p>
<p class="contents">The line-up of the new Commission, upon whose investiture Parliament was asked to vote today, admittedly takes these problems into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it does not provide any kind of response to the political issues and to some of the ethical issues which aroused the opposition of a majority of Members of this House on 27 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The replacement of Mr Buttiglione by Mr Frattini means that the post of Commissioner for freedom, security and justice is held by a man known for having drafted Italian laws intended to shield Mr Berlusconi from accusations against him, most notably those relating to corruption. Moreover, the portfolio for competition continues to be held by Mrs Kroes, whose links with the world of business mean that there is a real risk that conflicts of interest will occur.</p>

A mere three changes will have been enough to secure this approval, changes which are of secondary importance on the face of it, but which are in fact extremely telling.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes include the removal of Mr Buttiglione, who dared to make a distinction between the natural family and homosexuality, as well as that of Mrs Udre, whom you believed to be guilty of putting up too spirited a defence of her country’s farmers. A place remains within the Commission for Mr Kovács, however, the erstwhile Hungarian Stalinist turned model socialist, who excelled in his incompetence. Mrs Kroes is still to be in charge of competition, despite her links with multinational corporations, and Mrs Fischer Boel is still to be in charge of agriculture, despite the fact that her husband farms pigs in Russia, which creates an obvious conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a line-up of Commissioners means that the Commission as a whole is only putting on a pretence of ‘independence’. It is indeed independent of nations and of the Member States, but it is a long way from being independent of multinational corporations or of doctrines which enforce the majority opinion and destroy freedom, as recently seen in Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the sad truth is that the Barroso Commission is perfect for the tasks which await it: accelerated globalisation under America’s thumb, the de-industrialisation of Europe, the accession of Turkey, the disappearance of nation states to be replaced by a European super-state endowed with a Constitution, the dismantling of the European social model and the organisation of immigration …</p>

Although the most inappropriate of the original Commissioners-designate has, thanks to Parliament’s intervention, been prevented from taking up his post in the college of Commissioners, I feel that this is a Commission with an excessively neoliberal bias, under a leadership that could do a good job provided it does not backslide on the democratic principles and objectives of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not, however, vote in favour of the Commission due to serious misgivings about the fact that Mrs Kroes has retained her competition portfolio. I have no doubts as to her skills, not least because her appointment would be a case of ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’. What is at stake, however, is her personal suitability – essential in a Commissioner – given that, among the numerous multinationals to which she has declared professional links, she omitted the arms producer Lockheed Martin.</p>

<p class="contents">I would have liked the Hungarians to display a great deal of sensitivity. Mr Kovács should not have been a candidate for a second time, and not only because of his Communist mindset. Whether his abilities, which were not up to coping with energy issues, will be adequate for the tax portfolio remains to be seen. Mrs Kroes from the Netherlands is likely to become the Commission’s specialist for discord. She lacks the independence that competition issues demand, and so the current Presidency of the Council ought to have withdrawn her.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a rather unsympathetic view of the withdrawal of Mr Buttiglione, whose high level of expertise would have enriched the whole Commission. Many members of the public would have liked to see him – perhaps in another position – as an interpreter, even though not all of them share his views. Europe must remain a platform for the free expression of opinions, the free practice of religion, and for cultural pluralism. Mr Buttiglione, a former Member of this House, repeatedly affirmed his adherence to European values and undertook to abide by the law as it stands.</p>

Unfortunately, this has not been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed that the first opportunity was thwarted three weeks ago. I am appalled by the disgraceful way in which Members of this House and certain parliamentary services were predisposed towards an orchestrated smear campaign against Mr Buttiglione, and were even found to be directly promoting that campaign. The lies were served up in bad faith to feed groups of activists and do not correspond in any objective way to what was said in the parliamentary hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, coming from Portugal as I do, I believe that no compatriot of mine with the slightest awareness of the reality of Europe could, as a Portuguese Member of this House, vote against a Commission that for the first time has a Portuguese President. I did not expect Members to persist in such blindness, which is somewhat sectarian and missing the point.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a downright shame – and we have to take note of this once again today – that a capable person is being sacrificed on the altar of political correctness, for the simple reason that he also has a personal conviction that does not appear to correspond to that of the majority in this Parliament. That in the light of the fact that the self-same Commission that we approved today includes the likes of Louis Michel, the personal friend, fellow worker and the help and stay of dictators with blood on their hands, such as Laurent Kabila in the past, or Fidel Castro these days.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a disgrace, but at least we know where we stand. This Commission is politically correct; this Commission is intent on forcing even more sameness down our throats with the European Constitution. This Commission wants to saddle us with a non-European country like Turkey. We will not renounce our true European ideals. We will fight this Commission tooth and nail in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is at any rate an unsatisfactory one. Following a hate campaign from the Left, Mr Buttiglione had to disappear on account of expressing opinions that are reported to be politically incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the possible conflict of interests of which Mrs Kroes and Mrs Fischer-Boel are suspected is not a problem. Similarly, the Communist, Stalinist past of Mr Kovács does not seem to be an issue. This is simply a case of double standards, and that is all that has to be said on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk about democracy, but in reality, freedom of opinion is being curbed, and no consideration is given to what the public wants. The issue of Turkey is a classic example of this. The new Commission intends to force through Turkey’s accession at all costs, against the will of the overwhelming majority of Europeans. That is another reason why today’s Commission is a Commission that does not deserve any support or confidence whatsoever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A comfortable majority had already supported and approved President Barroso in July. In October, his political authority was, however, weakened due to a lack of rigour, initially in connection with the Italian affair. As if that were not enough, no lessons were learned, either by certain Member States or by the President of the Commission, who gave way by agreeing to have at least one Commissioner – in fact, there are probably two – remain subject to suspicion because of a permanent risk of a conflict of interests. There are no doubts about the actual individual, who is to be commended; but her appointment is really quite unwise. We are disappointed. We shall distrust this Commission, and we shall make it our duty to monitor matters and be vigilant. Europe needs rigour and clarity.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us not forget that Parliament adopted unanimously the European Union Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and that the Commission has not adopted that Code. Furthermore, following a request from the European Ombudsman to amend the provisions of the Ombudsman’s Statute concerning his right of access to documents and the hearing of witnesses, Parliament recommended amending those provisions, but they have yet to be amended due to reservations on the part of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s role has had the positive effect of informing the citizens of their rights and obligations concerning the European Institutions. This House must therefore make every effort to hold a joint review of the Ombudsman’s Statute with the aim of making it more efficient and better able to address the citizens’ requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
