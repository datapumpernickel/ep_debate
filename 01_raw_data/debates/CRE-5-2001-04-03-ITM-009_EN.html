<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro has been a reality since 1 January 1999 and the coins and notes will be introduced in 272 days. We will thereby complete the historic process of passing from our countries each having their own currencies to sharing the same currency within the Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first two years of the euro have led to the consolidation of good economic results and substantial advances. I am not going to repeat the figures for growth or inflation or the extent to which monetary policy has contributed to growth or to the convergence of our economies, nor the role played by the euro as a protective factor in the face of external crises. In any event, it is clear that the euro has had a definite impact on financial integration and has created the conditions for a broad and very fluid European market.</p>
<p class="contents">This new situation enables us to confront the challenges facing us, such as those in the field of budgetary policy. It enables us to prevent this being procyclical and to prepare ourselves for the risks posed by the ageing of the population, to speed up our structural reforms in order to improve our growth potential, to make progress in the field of financial legislation in order to further integrate the markets, and to complete the process through the introduction of notes and coins, which we hope will take place successfully on 1 January.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no doubt that the introduction of the euro is going to be an historic event. Every company, consumer and authority must adapt to this new situation, and the communication being presented today consists of a report on the situation with regard to the preparations for the introduction of coins and notes, but also, as well as assessing the general situation, additional work is being carried out: on the one hand, to establish to what extent the content of the Commission recommendation of last 11 October has been complied with by the Member States and, secondly, to establish a series of good practices, the application of which may contribute to aiding the correct development of operations relating to the introduction of notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible that this new communication will mark the end of Commission communications to the Council. And I say it is possible because we do not rule out the idea that, if new factors arise which suggest the need for a new communication, then this would be done next October. In any event, I would like to respond to the two questions which are the subject of today’s document: what is the current situation and what new practices are proposed. The framework of preparations presents a situation which I would call unequal. It is not a black or white situation; it is a grey situation and, in some cases, it is too dark a grey, but only in some very specific cases, it is true.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to companies, it is true that, generally, the preparation of large companies has made very satisfactory progress, but small and medium-sized businesses are still somewhat behind. Approximately half of them have improved the situation, but still half of them have no action plan to transfer to the euro on 1 January. What is more significant is that one in three of them is still not aware that 1 January 2002 is the time limit for carrying our all their operations in euros. Therefore, increasing the awareness of small and medium-sized businesses is still one of the fundamental concerns of our communication.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to consumers, the eurobarometer for January demonstrates the consumers’ vision of the euro, and we must acknowledge that in some cases it is relatively confused. For example, one in every four people (25 per cent) believes that euro notes and coins issued in one country will only be legal currency in that country, which indicates that a factor as fundamental as the existence of the single currency is still not fully understood. One in every five, however, is not aware, for example, that the introduction of the euro will be accompanied by the withdrawal of the old currencies and, although progress has been made on the issue of the timetable, 40% of citizens do not yet know the exact date of the introduction of euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous information campaigns have had limited effects, but it is true that it is difficult to persuade consumers to take an interest in an event which they see as far off. There is plenty of documentation, but that documentation is not always read. We are convinced that this situation will improve at the beginning of the second six-month period, with large companies that issue invoices changing their bank accounts and other means of collecting payment early. This will contribute to consumers being progressively more involved in the new situation we are creating. Public administrations are generally prepared and offer the public the opportunity to use the euro in a very broad range of operations, although it is true that they could play a more significant role, acting as a catalyst for the whole of the economy, for example, by paying, public contracts or officials’ salaries in euros, something which has taken place in some Member States, but not in all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The banks are cooperating well; they are carrying out changes in advance in their relations with their clients; the adaptation of automatic cash dispensers in 2002 will probably be very rapid, and even immediate in the majority of Member States; in general, they will issue notes of low value and will thereby contribute to alleviating the problems of returning change which may arise in commercial operations. The exchange of national notes for euros will be free and unlimited in the majority of participating States during the period of dual circulation. The banks have in fact become one of the driving forces in the transfer to the euro and their policy of early exchange is a very important contribution to increasing awareness of the euro amongst economic operators.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also developed a series of good practices, which are nothing more than a series of simple, practical ideas which are being applied in some Member States and which are being made known to the others so that they can also apply them. In today’s communication, the Commission offers 20 new practices, 10 to be applied before the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January, and another 10 which could be implemented at a later date. Those measures are not applicable in all the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union, but they are a set of ideas which each Member State may have recourse to and use if the State considers it appropriate. I will mention some, which are, as I said before, relatively simple ideas such as distributing to small businesses instruments for calculating the exchange of currency while the national currency and the euro are being used at the same time. Or creating and distributing instruments for calculating the cash requirements of small businesses, a fundamental issue when it comes to calling for the front loading of notes and coins. Another measure, in agreement with consumers and businesspeople, is to start to pay a part of salaries, at the end of the year, with ‘kits’ of euro coins, which is a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">After the introduction of the notes and coins on 1 January 2002, other issues of interest may be raised. For example, we recommend that sales do not take place, as is usually the case in some Member States, on 2 January, as that would give rise to an unmanageable situation from the point of view of the operation of those businesses. We also recommend, for example, that the ‘neutralisation’ of national notes be authorised for some economic operators, so that we can reduce the risks of transport. We also propose, for example, as has happened in France, that specific precalibrated instruments for the old currency be created, so that the exchange of national coins may take place more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a series of ideas which we believe to be useful, which have been applied already in some Member States and which are no doubt going to be have a positive effect in terms of ensuring that this introduction of notes and coins for 300 million Europeans takes place more easily. The logistical operation is of great importance, and we should try to resolve the majority of the problems before that date arrives so that these possible second level and less important practical problems do not cloud the fundamental issue, that is the introduction of euro notes and coins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards your current statement, which is hopefully more comprehensive and detailed on paper than what we have just heard, I have two main problems: firstly, how do you verify that the funds provided by the European Union for the information campaign are actually being used efficiently and constructively, and in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations and the basic political message, in the Member States? I ask this question because I have the feeling that we have become more of a channel for EU funding and are relinquishing our leading role in the information campaign under the guise of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">And secondly: what do you intend to do to persuade the Ministers responsible, especially the ECOFIN Council, and include them in this much-needed action programme in the information campaign on a mandatory basis, not just in an advisory capacity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My obligation is to resolve the problems and view the difficulties rather coolly and with a certain distance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we may have a distorted view of reality. When you see the communication you will see the level of decision which each of the Member States has reached and the amount of information available at a national level. I believe that the citizens who have wished to be informed have been so, the companies are reasonably well informed and the public administrations are also acting.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is the case that the coins and notes campaign has still not begun, since most of it will begin in June, and be reinforced in September. There will be national campaigns, as well as a European Central Bank campaign which will undoubtedly have a specific effect on coins and notes and their technical characteristics, including security characteristics, which will take place as we come closer to the final stage and will give everybody a clearer knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem which you have raised is a rather complex issue, which you know well, and which appears on page 46 of our communication. I am not yet able to offer you a definitive solution. You will be able to see there the progress we are making on the different problems raised and that, since November 2000, the banking association has launched the STEP I project, which is the first project to offer us a system of compensation at a cross-border level, which should be a key element in helping us to reduce the cost of these operations which, for you and for us, are an issue of special concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is going to be very difficult for the citizen to understand that, from 1 January, and working with euros in different countries, that a cheque in Portuguese euros paid in Portugal is not going to cost the same as a cheque in Portuguese euros paid in Belgium or vice versa. Therefore, this is a point which has to be resolved, but resolving it necessitates the existence of a cross-border compensation system equivalent to the national compensation systems. You will see in the difficulties posed by this issue in the communication, and we are prepared to do everything necessary to launch this project because we agree that it is a fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to guidelines, I would say to Mr Karas that these have been established, with the Commission, through the different agreements which have been reached with the different Member States and, therefore, we are convinced that, if the agreements which have been reached for transfers of resources are applied correctly, there should be no problems in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would say the same to the respective ministers in relation to their national programmes. The national programmes are all being discussed in the Commission. There are references to each of the national programmes, including the communication issues, even the web pages relating to each Member State and the present communication informs us of exactly the action which each of the Member States has planned. In any event, if Parliament or yourself have any doubt about any particular programme, we are prepared to give you the relevant information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, 9 May is also supposed to convince young people in the European Union that their future lies in Euroland. What are you doing, what is the Commission doing, and what are you arranging with the Member States so that a Euro project day takes place in every school before the end of this year? Do you plan to launch a specific initiative here?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly,what measures can be taken to help boost consumer confidence and ensure that in terms of consumer protection, there are no grounds to fear price distortions during conversion and a lack of transparency in price calculation?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, do you intend to continue the Euro information campaign with the Member States at least during the first half of next year, and if so, in what form? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, on the whole, things are going well. We still have a few months left. Ordinary consumers and small businesses are not great planners, and the information will only strike home once they realise that things are getting serious and that it is high time they did something about it. Of course, we could lend them a helping hand, and I have two suggestions in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the SMEs are concerned, they should be given incentives in order to be ready on time. So far, there are a great many small and medium-sized businesses, especially those working for the local market, who can only see the drawbacks. They need to invest in order to be able to work with the euro, but they are not gaining any direct benefits. My question is whether it would not be possible for the Commission to encourage the Member States by, for example, offering SMEs small fiscal incentives to be prepared in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to make the consumer fully conversant with the fact that coins are not exchangeable in every Member State. Foreign coins must be spent, and it is vital for people to know this before the summer. So I would advise you to give them plenty of warning about this. Secondly, could I suggest that you take the initiative of collecting all coins locally and maybe using them for a good cause? That is better than simply binning them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the activities for 9 May, as you know, in cooperation with the chairman of the eurogroup, it has been agreed to communicate the 9 May initiative relating to schools to the Ecofin Council, in Malmö, and the Commission will print 400 000 little passports which our delegations will make available to the schools so that the children can begin to familiarise themselves with this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to the consumers’ difficulties with prices, we make certain references in this communication to factors which may be useful in guaranteeing that the rounding up or down of product prices does not benefit the retailer. We also insist that national administrations, in relation to the payment of taxes, for example – and the Belgian administration has done this – round prices down rather than up, so that the public administrations may be the first to demonstrate that the euro does not have to have inflationary effects, but precisely the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the fundamental problem with the information campaigns – as you know – is that they are national. This means that some of the funds for 2002 can be used to finance some of the existing commitments. Campaigns have not only been carried out in accordance with calendar years. However, there is no doubt that if there are remains of these resources, we should seriously consider using them to send a political message about the significance of the euro, as a change in our customs, and about the fundamental nature of the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say firstly to Mrs Thyssen that I agree with her that the small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers will not adapt until the last moment. Whether or not there are fiscal advantages is to be decided by the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity applies here and it is not for us to intervene on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Something we have insisted on though, amongst the good practices, is that the debiting which the Central Banks make to the commercial banking sector, the financial advantage which results from the currency charge, be also partially transferred to the companies, so that this type of operation does not imply an additional cost for them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to currencies, what you say is clear. We have not given any consideration to the recovery of currencies, but this is the element which initially is going to come into play most quickly. I take note of your proposal that an initiative of this type be created at a local level, which, as you say, may help to bring about a good result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Central and Eastern Europe, in particular, there are billions in circulation, especially in Deutschmarks, and in parts of the Balkans, the Deutschmark is the local currency, either officially or de facto. The people there will then suddenly be confronted with the euro from one day to the next as well. So my question is: How do you intend to provide information in these countries? Are you working with their national banks? Should they perhaps operate as issuing offices as well? How do you propose to prevent racketeers from cheating people with their own particular forms of currency exchange? I think there is a significant need for action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
