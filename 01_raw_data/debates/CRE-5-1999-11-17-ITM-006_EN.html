Hence the importance of the coming conference in Seattle and the timeliness and suitability of the proposals in the Commission’s communication as regards the upcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, given the challenges before us, it is clear that the next Round cannot be limited to simply widening the regulatory framework, however important that may be, nor must it only ensure that trade liberalisation contributes to economic and social growth in the less developed countries, although I share fully in that desire. Rather, it must also establish rules which will lead to the opening up of markets and guarantee compliance with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to bear in mind that for European industry – and I am thinking in particular of the textile sector – access to the markets of the developed countries and emerging economies on reciprocal terms is a fundamental priority. To this end it is essential that the Commission achieves the harmonisation of tariffs and the elimination of tariff peaks and tariff progression, as well as the removal of all technical barriers to trade, on the understanding that the less developed countries should be guaranteed free access to the international market for all their products so that they can also benefit from trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, Commissioner, I would like to ask you firstly if you can confirm your intention not to accept, on the agenda of the negotiations, any reconsideration of the agreement on the textile sector as regards the clothing industry and, secondly, how you consider that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation will affect the European textile industry, bearing in mind that that country is the world’s foremost exporter of textile products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and his desire to reach the widest possible consensus on a subject as important as the coming Millennium Round, which we depend on to consolidate a balanced trading system which will ensure, on a global level, an economic order based on social justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You already know that farmers in Europe are going to have to make great efforts to adapt in order to apply the Berlin compromise which, last March, represented the acceptable balance for the fifteen Member States of the European Union. You know that developing countries must be able to count on Europe in order to guarantee the legitimate rapid expansion of their own agriculture which is often the major sector in their economic development. You know that the United States is demonstrating today that the market alone finds it difficult to guarantee agricultural revenue. You must also know, then, that we are counting specifically on you to ensure that the WTO negotiations result in the outcome that we expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding access to the market, how is it possible not to recognise that Europe is not the well-defended fortress that it is unjustly accused of being, since we are the leading importer worldwide with a deficit trade balance in the food processing sector?</p>
<p class="contents">This reality, Commissioner, must make it possible for you to campaign so that markets are opened up and tariff barriers are reduced according to gradual processes, varying according to sector. As for market protection mechanisms, if they must be adjusted, should they not be retained or reinforced for particular countries, and I refer to developing countries in particular?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding internal support, how is it possible not to make the most of the fact that Agenda 2000 is leading to a significant reduction in the overall extent of support, at a time when the United States are adopting a policy which goes in the opposite direction? This situation must make it possible for you to ensure that the blue box and the green box accepted at Marrakech are retained, and that the peace clause is renewed.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding export subsidies, how is it possible not to capitalise on the strategy of reduction which we are undertaking with the new common agricultural policy? This development must give you the possibility of demanding transparency and handling of the various forms of export aid used by our competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Berlin Agreement was drawn up in order to give the European Union real room for manoeuvre in the Millennium Round. We have no doubt that you will be able to make use of this by building on the concept of multi-functionality which makes it possible to meet the various expectations of our societies as regards food quality, employment and sustainable rural development, the protection and conservation of the natural heritage and also regarding the balance between regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach must afford Europe the opportunity to be open to interesting possibilities of alliance. This is why we are counting on you to take the offensive in these negotiations, in which you may count on our critical support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that it is an increase in demand on the world market which is the most reliable guarantee of profitable European agriculture in the future. It is a much more reliable guarantee than stubborn persistence with our own protective system. Moreover, it is a liberalisation of world trade and improved competition which can lead to increased growth in the new industrialised countries and in populous developing countries. It is this which can mobilise the world’s huge need for food and convert it into a level of demand with great purchasing power. </p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we shall retain the European model. We shall take account, perhaps to a still greater extent, of the environment, public health, animal protection and multi-functionality – that is to say diversity – in the countryside and in agriculture. I think it is this and an open-minded attitude to the development of the information society which will be priorities in discussing the future shape of Europe. It is important, and a responsibility on our part, to pursue the questions of increased growth throughout the world in the World Trade Organisation negotiations. That is why I think that it is so important to say that demand is a more important consideration than the particular system we have here at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, for example, has come of the demand for an analysis of the WTO’s influence so far upon, for example, developing countries, the environment, the EU and existing treaties before we get into the next round of negotiations? To say, Commissioner Lamy, that there were no tools or methods for doing this and that these would first have had to be developed is simply laughable. </p>
<p class="contents">In revising the uniquely constituted Lomé Conventions, the refrain is always that that these ought not to remain in that form and that they are not WTO specific. What we should be demanding, however, is that the ground rules governing world trade must be focused upon the needs of people here in Europe and in developing countries. They must be enlisted in the service of sustainability and of social needs and not of the interests of corporations and their shareholders. This must be the main requirement and not a new round of liberalisation which serves only to incite people worldwide to compete for the lowest wages under the worst social and ecological conditions. In our opinion, the WTO needs to be fundamentally reformed before there are any further negotiations at all. Our goal must be nothing less than a fairer and socially and ecologically more responsible form of world trade which honours the interdependence of nations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that millions of individuals are affected by the consequences of the decisions which are to be taken there does, however, make this necessary. Those in favour of the liberalisation of trade as the driving force for prosperity are all the less willing to undertake such a report, since there can be no real denial that the situation has become worse in recent years, and inequalities between underdeveloped countries and advanced countries, as well as the development of inequalities even within developed countries, have intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">When wealth is concentrated at one extreme and there is an increase in unemployment at the other, one may well wonder if the WTO has not primarily served to institutionalise the law of the jungle. As a matter of urgency, a new concept of trade between nations must be promoted, based on solidarity, cooperation, democracy and the promotion of employment and social rights. However, so that all of this does not simply remain a vain hope, decisions must be taken, I believe, in three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, formalise the principle whereby these negotiations must be of use to disadvantaged countries and populations, affirming the right of the European Union and the Member States to defend their development policy and specific agreements with the ACP and the refusal to let the Lomé Conventions be challenged by the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, insist on the primacy of the interests of peoples in preference to commercial and financial criteria. I have three proposals relating to this. Of course, they are not comprehensive. Firstly, subject WTO regulations to the international charter and conventions governing matters of human rights and social, health and environmental issues. In saying this, I am thinking of Kyoto, Peking and Copenhagen. Next, refuse to continue to liberalise services and, on the contrary, assist the development of cooperation of public services in education, health and transport. Finally, maintain the principle of cultural exception, affording the European Union and the Member States the possibility of preserving their capability of freely determining their audiovisual cultural policy in the name of development of a thriving and enriching diversity. One more proposal: establish the precautionary principle for the environment, health and food safety as an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third area. Radical democratisation of the structures of the WTO is essential. There must be democratic supervision of the negotiations and of the implementation of agreements. The presence of NGOs, representatives of society and of trade unions, with the status of observers, must be accepted in these negotiations. What is more, all the points negotiated at the WTO must be ratified by the European Parliament and by national parliaments. Today the WTO itself is decreeing the laws, monitoring their application, and settling disputes. I think it is not possible to be both judge and judged. The dispute settlement body must be radically modified.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the short time available, I want to add my voice to that of those in this Parliament who insist on greater protection of Europe’s vital interests in the forthcoming world trade talks.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House have put our cards on the table in the Agenda 2000 agreement and must not allow or accept any dilution of that agreement by the United States of America. I say that in particular from an agricultural perspective. Part of the motivation behind Agenda 2000 is to conform in a credible way with world trade rules and in the process, of course, to make Europe a key player in world trade – and the Americans will not want that. We enter this new round of talks with the benefits of hindsight and in the knowledge that the United States, in reaching its negotiating position, will have, as in the past, researched the hidden agenda of establishing ways to deviate from that agreement to help its own producers, while at the same time demanding that Europe adhere rigidly to its requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House we have prioritised consumer protection, established the family farm as the agricultural model and the basic unit of production, and made rural development and the preservation of rural communities the second pillar of CAP reform. This is in sharp contrast with American policy. The time has come for us in this Parliament, on behalf of the European citizens, to establish our authority and leadership in this vital area of international trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to further free up world trade but this should be accompanied by pre-conditions at world level. In their policies, WTO Members should keep open the option of granting priority to public health, animal welfare, environmental protection and solidarity with developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to stress the position of the least developed countries. Their capacity to participate in the world trade system falls well below the mark. This is poignantly highlighted by the fact that Geneva has more lobbyists from the American steel industry than government officials from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our negotiators should make every effort to bring about real participation of these countries by granting institutional support, free access to our markets, observing concessions made – when it comes, for example, to textile products – and preventing so-called “green protectionism”. We cannot offer the western consumer the option of environmentally-friendly products without stimulating environmentally-friendly production processes in developing countries. I would like to exchange further ideas on this issue within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my respect for the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, regarding his activities and his unstinting willingness to compromise given the flood of amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lamy, you will again be there, in 2005, sitting in the same seat, and you will come and tell us that the European Union has enjoyed worldwide success in these global talks. In the final text of the regulations you will have achieved some mention of the precautionary principle, of health, even phyto-sanitary matters, an ILO-OMC forum and the recognition of environmental principles, insofar as they have already been recognised at Kyoto. The dispute settlement procedure will have been improved. Developing countries will have obtained positive discrimination, financed, indeed, by the European Union, like the ACP bananas. Chickens will have a few more centimetres’ room inside their cages, in the name of the animal welfare which will have been recognised, and the world of cinema and television will have obtained support in the form of a few aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In exchange, in order to achieve peace – and, indeed, a new peace clause – you will have made a number of concessions at Seattle. So, the “European Market” share will go from 5% to X%, there will only be residual internal support, export aid will have been prohibited, customs duties and tariff peaks will no longer be in place, direct investment will have been obtained thanks to Mr Lamy, and no thanks to the MAI, and the world market will have been established, a sort of commercial Fukuyama, and the GATT story will be over.</p>
<p class="contents">Then what will we do? The tenth round of the Uruguay Round will have no further business. You yourself could perhaps always go back to Crédit Lyonnais or to some multinational which hands out stock options. But what of the farmers, who will have been wiped out, the professions excluded from society, the textile industry, pharmaceuticals, shoes, heavy-duty vehicles, furniture, ships, toys, all that which will have been delivered up to competition from outside Europe, what is to become of them? It is all very well for us to produce reports, books, television programmes and fine speeches. The children of the Seattle negotiators will have their place in the twenty-first century and the children of the people excluded from society will, in turn, be excluded, since poverty is a socially transmitted disease. But, in the end, all that is unimportant. We are still strong enough to carry everyone else’s burdens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Seattle round is being called the ‘development round’ for the millennium. I represent the south-east of England, one of the richest parts of the European Union, having been born in a developing country in Asia, one of the poorest parts of the world. I hope I can therefore span, understand and recognise the aspirations of the developed world, and of the developing world, recognising the enormous benefits of global free trade whilst also recognising the imperative need to manage the transition, to enable and empower the developing world to be an equal partner in globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The multilateral trading system was born in Havana in 1948 as the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. Eight rounds of trade globalisation have helped to promote global prosperity. Since 1951, world trade has grown 17-fold, world production more than quadrupled, world per capita income doubled, average tariffs dropped from 40% to 4% in industrialised countries. Today, a further cut of 50% in border protection, including agricultural subsidies, would add over USD 370 billion to global annual welfare gains. Sixty per cent of this would accrue to developing countries. However, globalisation must be a win-win situation. There should not be winners and losers. Everyone should win. It can be made to happen. How can it be made to happen? The multilateral system should be fair, transparent, accountable and link trade to development. It should look at the impact of liberalisation on investments, competition rules, unfair subsidies, poor labour standards, environmental protection, intellectual property rights, trade facilitation, government procurement, improved access to agricultural markets, improved access to commercial markets including services, consumer protection and capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is unique in terms of the history of its relationships with countries around the world – Britain with the Commonwealth, France with its French francophone countries. We can send a clear message to Seattle that this is the single contribution that this House and its Members can make to world global trade.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also particularly welcome the fact that in his text he describes the forthcoming WTO round as a development round. It is a fact, of course, that of the 134 members of the WTO, two-thirds are developing countries, with another 32 in a queue waiting to join.</p>
<p class="contents">But it remains the case that the exchange of trade commitments favours the bigger traders. They have much more to offer and their negotiating power is far greater. Many developing countries feel that free trade has not in fact been as free for them. Markets in the North remain restricted for many, as the most important developing country exports seek access.</p>
<p class="contents">Accelerating globalisation is, of course, a fact of life. It nevertheless demands analysis and an acknowledgement that international trade is complex and is characterised by protectionism and by a system which fails to address the implications of subsidised agriculture for the poor. While we need, of course, to support the agricultural sector in the EU, and that is made clear in Mr Schwaiger’s report, we also have to recognise the need for developing economies beyond reaching markets to have access to food security so that people have enough to eat. And I hope that amendments along those lines will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU already has binding commitments to developing countries. These commitments, alongside international development targets, should be a central focus at Seattle. We are now, Mr Lamy, at a critical stage in the negotiations for a successor agreement to Lomé IV and we will soon be embarking on complex discussions on trade relations with 71 ACP countries. It is therefore very important now that we are negotiating a multilateral trade framework which respects that very critical relationship with the developing world that we continue to say that we will honour our obligations to the ACP. I would also urge the Commission and Member States to pursue a WTO binding commitment to allow all exports from least-developed countries duty-free access to European markets by 2003. There is also an urgent need to make sure that small and vulnerable states – landlocked states – are protected in future deals that are made.</p>
<p class="contents">A Director-General of the WTO very recently said that the WTO must be an organisation where the little guy not only has a say but feels that he is protected and defended. I hope, Mr Lamy, that you will subscribe to that very important sentiment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the last five years, this fact has been precisely illustrated. Most people have become increasingly poorer while a handful of profiteers, consisting mainly of big corporations, have banked ever larger profits. Those who lose out are left behind in their masses by the World Trade Organisation in what is a yawning chasm of injustice. In 1994, not many Members of the European Parliament shared our reservations about the WTO’s withdrawal from the social and ecological spheres. In the end, most people at that time, however, spoke in favour of the WTO on the assumption that trade would lead to the problems solving themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are suddenly hearing new voices speaking of the need to regain lost ground in the social and ecological spheres. In spite of this, a majority of this Chamber will, in the end, again vote for the Agreement although nothing has been solved and although, in Geneva, it is becoming less probable day by day that there will be a Millennium Round of negotiations at all. </p>
<p class="contents">Our first demand, therefore, is that mistakes should be discovered and learned from. And yet many of my colleagues do not want any evaluation of the WTO’s influence so far. Why, for heaven’s sake, is the idea of an assessment of this kind rejected so vehemently? Is not something being defended here that simply does not work, namely the ideology of the free market? </p>
<p class="contents">Just to clarify the contradictions in the TRIPS Agreement, it should be noted that 90% of biological resources come from the countries of the southern hemisphere, but 97% of seed patents are held by companies in industrialised nations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is the affluent part of the northern hemisphere which therefore has access to genetic information. Through the TRIPS Agreement, the screws are being tightened ever more on the south. Traditional medicines continue to be categorised as discoveries, while medicines based upon these but developed by the pharmaceutical industry are passed off as inventions. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the TRIPS Agreement runs counter to, among other things, the Convention on Biological Diversity, promotes product piracy and is protectionist. It, too, in this way, prevents independent development in the developing countries. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude: while a panegyric to free trade is being delivered here, the sparks are flying in Geneva. The draft declarations that have been made so far are completely unacceptable, both to ourselves and to developing countries. Even health, culture and education are being sacrificed to the free market. </p>
<p class="contents">The standstill clause will prevent our legislation from being developed. A report which does not give a central place to these problems effectively ignores what is essentially going on here: a process in which the profit interests of the few are secured more rapidly through the exploitation of nature and human beings.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can agree with him. The new millennium simply represents the free trade ideology. We have experience of the free trade in capital. It is called globalisation. It is electronic capitalism. In fact, it is not free trade, as the IMF has given American investors guarantees regarding the risks they take, and paid them damages that have been incurred by the free trade in capital.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no rules in the capital game and politicians can no longer become referees. However, it is now possible to negotiate rules for the trade in goods and services, and it is possible to act in such a way that capital freedoms do not spread their exploitative power on such a broad global scale as electronic capitalism. I defend green protectionism because I want us to eat healthy food and I want it to be produced in a sustainable way. That cannot be called protectionism, as it is a question of survival. I also defend red protectionism, which tries to safeguard workers’ rights and prevent malpractice, such as the use of child labour. In this respect also this type of protectionism is, from the point of view of social security, a question of survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the Millennium Round is taking place at a very special time for the European economy, and the international economy in particular. Indeed, globalisation is now a subject that is discussed on a daily basis. It has lead to the free market and to victory over any economic theory. Having said that, I do not mean that we have a perfect market and, precisely for this reason, being aware of both the benefits and the corruption, we must seek to establish standards and regulations by means of agreements such as those proposed by the WTO in order to insure all of us against excesses of any type. Just think of the financial speculation that can overwhelm entire geographical areas, reducing them to poverty or even causing institutional upheaval.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the WTO round of negotiations is not being used to create something that is supranational, as is often feared, something that circumvents international rights or does not want to let the free market fluctuate, but it is being used to set out, in particular, specific rules for all of us, at the same time safeguarding certain fundamental rights such as the right to health, education and social duties in a framework that protects the rights of each individual citizen. </p>
<p class="contents">However, as far as the prices of products and services are concerned, we must ask for not only a tariff reduction but, above all, we should also make a request in terms of the quality of the products and services themselves, as a means of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises. This will be increasingly important in the future, and there is also the increasing need to emphasise the central importance of agriculture within individual economies, and – and this is stressed in the report, but increasingly, each one of us needs to press forward resolutely with this – to protect small and medium-sized enterprises with appropriate legislation. If we manage to comply with these obligations and improve quality of life with sustainable development, both in economic and environmental terms, we will have laid strong foundations for a better society in the next millennium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the last few decades, over the recent quinquennia, international trade – Europe is the homeland of David Ricardo – has allowed us to create wealth, thanks to a new international division of labour. It has also brought about social inclusion and has defeated poverty which, given the growth in population, would have been much worse than it actually is today without international trade. </p>
<p class="contents">One final point: we are trying to include too many things, too many requests on different subjects in the Millennium Round talks, perhaps to ease our conscience, when – and I am referring to capital punishment – in its own forum and at the UN, Europe cannot manage to put up a united front or find the strength to impose certain things. And then we want to debate capital punishment and other subjects in fora for trade agreements where it is inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not have any fears in this respect. However, my concern is that the world, further to a new WTO agreement, may become richer economically speaking but poorer in the area of culture and environment or in terms of agriculture or horticulture, and that we may lose out on business in those areas which are essential for Europe. It is important to find a balance in this respect. This is why I am delighted with the Schwaiger report, because this very report indicates that we should hold on to what is essential to us, whilst keeping an open mind towards the world, and because this report links political reality and the issues we can defend on behalf of Europe’s citizens in our capacity as parliamentarians. It is essential that we voice the issues that are apparent within Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make two remarks regarding agriculture and horticulture. The representative of the Council said this morning that the Berlin Agreement forms the starting point for these negotiations, but he also mentioned that agriculture could well prove to be a sticking point. In this respect, I feel that Europe should be more on the offensive. May I remind you that as a trading bloc, we are the largest importer and second largest exporter? At the same time, in a couple of years, out of the total budget for agriculture, horticulture and rural development, a mere 10% will be earmarked for product support. In other words, if we take into account the national budget, then we note that only 2% of government spending within Europe is set aside for agriculture, horticulture and rural development. If we refer to the 10% of this amount for product support, this is a negligible amount worldwide. To all those who advocate the dismantling of agricultural policy within the framework of the WTO, I would like to point out that Europe boasts its own standard in terms of the environment, animal welfare and consumer protection. Whoever is in favour of scrapping the European agricultural policy, also favours the scrapping of all we have acquired in Europe in terms of rural policy, animal welfare and welfare in general. This means that I also defend the European standard and we, as a Parliament, have to opt in favour of the Schwaiger report, because it offers guarantees for freer trade but, at the same time, also offers guarantees for preserving what we pride ourselves on, rightly so, within Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to grab this unique chance with both hands to tackle the problems of the future. This is why it is important not to restrict ourselves in the negotiations to two topics only, namely agriculture and services. There are other important topics which require a solution at international level. For example, we need stricter rules for the environment and labour, an effective competition policy should be drafted and it is important that appropriate measures be taken regarding food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I fail to understand why some take such a sceptical, or even hostile, stance regarding this coming trade negotiation. This may well be down to an inadequate policy which lacks in transparency. It is therefore time that the World Trade Organisation asserts itself and underlines its significance as the World Trade Organisation. Free trade is not a dirty word. Trade liberalisation based on equal and fair conditions gives globalisation a human face. After all, fair and correct trade at world level implies attention to ecological and social aspects and takes into account all the players involved, thereby including the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, I only hope that the EU negotiators stamp their authority on the discussions, thus immediately authenticating the WTO’s fundamental right of existence as an international organisation now and in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One commentator even believes that the Chinese Communist Party’s monopoly on power will be broken because membership of the World Trade Organisation means freedom of communication, including by means of unchecked Internet contacts. We can only hope that this will be the case. But might it not equally well happen instead that the regime will be reinforced by means of a form of economic growth which favours an urban minority but simultaneously creates tens of millions of new unemployed when state enterprises are left to go under, ruthlessly and without any networks of social protection, at the same time as millions of farmers become unemployed because of the new competition in the agricultural sphere?</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is the case that China cannot become a member of the World Trade Organisation without the EU’s also agreeing to this. I really hope therefore that, in its negotiations with China, the European Commission will take account of all the social and ecological aspects of the issue which the Americans clearly cared not one little bit about when they negotiated with the Chinese. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Here, it is not a question of expressing our opposition to pursuing greater efficiency in the multilateral relations system, but rather a question of paying the greatest attention to some important aspects. If the first is the continuation of the inequalities between developing countries and industrialised countries, then there is also the social dumping that is being created within these very industrialised countries. It is undeniable that the process of European convergence for the launch of the single currency has led to occasions and opportunities for growth and development in all Member States. Nevertheless, today, we are confronted by a different process of convergence that is underway, in particular, between territorial macro-contexts where Europe seems to present itself in positions that certainly are not strong, with the risk, therefore, that its economic characteristics – founded on small and medium-sized businesses – will be compromised, as well as its cultural and social characteristics. In this respect, we do not think that public safeguards and duties such as schools, welfare systems – including health – and pension schemes can be part of the services to be regulated. </p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to agriculture, for which, along with greater liberalisation of the market in favour of developing countries, there is the request not only for the Community principles to be upheld – support for environmental policy and the drawing up of a food policy for consumer protection – but also for typical national agricultural characteristics and products to be protected. </p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect relates to investments and related rules, but also to the local conditions for the implementation thereof. The condition of tariff and fiscal advantage is one of the first conditions, and the premise should at least be to harmonise the financial institutions, if not the tax rates. Moreover, the States’ recognised prerogative on this policy should also be translated into the possibility of a differentiated application throughout the States’ territories, otherwise – apart from the simplification of the processes – the only condition remaining would be the flexibility of labour. However, we hope that in this regard, the principles of the ILO and related conventions will be taken on board, starting with the convention on the protection of working minors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we hope that Parliament will be able to play an active part in the Millennium Round, starting with prior knowledge of the Commission’s study on the estimated impact of the effects of the new regulatory process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he is right up to a point, which makes the rapporteur’s work all the more remarkable and meritorious and I thank him. Furthermore it highlights the difficult nature of the task which we will have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, in this Parliament, we examined a report on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment which, in a very dramatic way, began by saying that we were discussing a world economic constitution. If that was true then, it is even more true now, given that we are going to discuss issues such as agriculture, services, intellectual property and direct investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult when, as the rapporteur said at the beginning, it is not a question of simply opting for free trade, but rather opting for a just form of free trade. And so that this free trade may be a just free trade, it is clear that we have to reconcile trading practices with the rules regarding the environment, workers’ rights, the European agricultural model and consumer protection. To sum up, we are going to discuss practically everything, every sector and every Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the important issue at the moment is the method which we must follow. And in this report the rapporteur – and I am with him – opts for a Commission which will act as a major player. We call on all the States to back the Commission, we call on the Commission to take account of the sensibilities and needs of the candidate and associated countries and we call on the Intergovernmental Conference to broaden the negotiating capacities of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But, since love is rewarded by love, all of this will only be possible if the Commission responds to Parliament by treating it as a partner and accomplice in the negotiating strategy with regard to the recommendations of the various sectors, the negotiating guidelines and the approval of the Treaties. Only in this way, Commissioner, will we be able to work together over these three years because – believe me – all of us have tables covered in documents and requests from the various sectors involved and we will only be able to satisfy them if the Commission is able to satisfy our demands. As Tenorio said “If you do it like that, may God reward you or, if not, may he punish you”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that the aim of this round must be to reduce inequalities in development, unlike what has happened after previous rounds. Today, the African continent has a less than 3% share of world trade. The rules of the multilateral trade system must take account of the differences in countries’ situations, resources and levels of development. Free trade which does not take any other factors into account just makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker. This is why we would not be able to accept a challenge to the principles of our cooperation with the countries of the south, particularly with ACP countries, and of course in this context I am thinking of the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, on the contrary, that we should restate the commitments that we made at the ACP-EU Joint Assembly which was held a few weeks ago. Europe must go to Seattle with a concept of globalisation that is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by just one power. Europe must, on the contrary, promote a concept based on a multipolar world and encourage the establishment of economically and politically integrated regional groups, as we have ourselves been trying to do for the last forty years. How can we refuse others what we granted ourselves after the war, to reconstruct our industry, agriculture and economy? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must confine the WTO, strictly limit its role and keep isolated from the WTO’s sphere of competence those sectors which jeopardise society’s very identity and which must continue to remain the sovereignty of the citizens and of their elected institutions. Education, health, public and social services, public transport and culture are all examples of sectors which cannot be brought into trade negotiations and cannot be dealt with by an international trade court. We must refuse to join the race to make every sector subject to the market. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must defend the principle of a hierarchy of norms. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, and those on the environment are, by their very nature, superior to the standards that govern trade. We should not condemn a State on the grounds that it is applying the precautionary principle, that it is protecting its environment or that it is refusing imports which are proven to have been produced by child labour. On the contrary, we must be able to bring an appeal against a decision by the WTO before the International Labour Organisation or before the competent bodies at the United Nations. On the eve of this new round, we are struck by the way society at large and international public opinion have forced their way into the debate. I think that this is an excellent development, because it is the best guarantee that it will not be possible to drop these issues during these negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are embarking on an important process at Seattle, from the point of view of global development and global controllability. The world also needs rules and standards; competition alone is not enough, although our main aim with the WTO process is the more efficient organisation of trade. It is an immense challenge. The EU is promoting a solution to the challenges of Third World sustainable development and social justices. We have to remain firm in this objective. Although the liberalisation of world trade means economic benefits and prosperity, we also have to view it critically. In addition to a freer market in the production of food, we should be talking not only about the precautionary principle, but also about supporting local production and encouraging regional food chains. The best guarantee of food safety is transparency of the food chain and clear areas of monitoring and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must have a clear idea of priorities in the talks. In brief, we could say that the viability of European family agriculture is a guarantee of the purity of food. For that reason, the most important issue in the WTO talks will be securing adequate amounts of aid to ensure agriculture is profitable. That is also why the existence of the blue box, alongside the green, is essential to preserve the European model. There is no question of horsetrading when it comes to matters of agriculture and food safety. Although we are trying to reduce import barriers for industrial products and services, it cannot be done at the expense of health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does it support globalisation, but it is also committed to giving it form and the force of law in order to impose dictatorship by the market. It actively contributes to the establishment of neo-liberal policies which find their expression in attacks upon public services, the right to employment, health and food safety and upon the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European delegation subscribes to the liberal way of thinking. It advocates an extension of the WTO’s powers, which is completely rejected by the associations and organisations that have become involved, who are instead calling for both an assessment of the WTO’s last five years and a moratorium on the forthcoming negotiations. We support this approach which is a first step towards radically questioning the capitalist world order. This is why we cannot vote for the Schwaiger report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is an aspect in relation to which we can say that our results are bad. I refer to the dispute settlement procedure. We have had two significant disputes – over bananas and hormones – which the European Union lost, and there has been one dispute which we have not even dared to put before the settlement system: I am referring to the American Helms-Burton and d’Amato laws for extra-territorial application to European companies. I have the impression that this issue will have to be reviewed at the World Conference, at the World Round. I believe that we will have to see how the mechanism for the settlement of disputes can be adjusted according to the needs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other legal aspects, because the Treaty of the World Trade Organisation is not a unique treaty. There are other international treaties, such as those agreed within the framework of the International Labour Organisation, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the multilateral agreements relating to the environment. I hope that in the Seattle Conference these issues will be dealt with in such a way that the new agreements will, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, bring about an appropriate legal framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, even America and China have come closer together over the WTO question. It is precisely a rapprochement of this kind that we in the EU-China Delegation have spent long years trying to achieve. So the wheel of history, for whose fashioning we are partly responsible, does turn constructively and progressively provided that traders’ concepts and ideas, stamina and charisma have the power to convince. That applies across the board but also to particular sectors of industry and, naturally and quite specifically, to the maritime sector, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Waterways bind routes and continents on our planet, and they are rich in as yet unexhausted natural resources. Through new technological developments, shipping and shipbuilding can again be sectors of the economy which are aiming high. Who would have thought so just a short time ago? We are fighting for a similarly positive status for the fisheries sector, too. In spite of the basically different methods of management, I am therefore appealing, for example, to Mr Cunha, as agricultural rapporteur, to also consider the fisheries sector, particularly since Mr Cunha is also my coordinator on the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Who would want to dispute the fact? In spite of the tiny budget allocated to it, an efficient fisheries sector forms a not insignificant part of any dynamic trade and budget policy for the EU and should be seen as a sector of the economy in its own right and as a significant branch of the food industry. There are also a large number of jobs concentrated there – in the EU, in third countries and worldwide. If we lose this sector, we weaken those regions which are already structurally weak anyway, and all in a quite irresponsible way. Let us beware, therefore, of regarding the WTO as a panacea for our problems. Only if we start from a healthy position at home will we make a convincing case to competitors on our planet. Even a totally liberalised market may possibly mean the exploitation of fish stocks beyond their ability to replenish themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want us to have a responsible and sustainable fisheries sector characterised by partnership, and I wish Mr Schwaiger and his team every success in the negotiations, not least for our own benefit. </p>

<p class="contents">This can be expressed through our socialist philosophy: we are in favour of a market economy, but we are opposed to a market society. And this philosophical train of thought is causing us to diverge from two opposing visions that are in play at this Seattle Summit. The first is held by those who think that the market does not create wealth: we, on the other hand, think that the market does create wealth. We also disagree with those who think that the market solves all problems. </p>
<p class="contents">It is we socialists who uphold the idea that the market helps to create wealth, but that there must be regulation for there to be a redistribution of this wealth which is equitable and which respects sustainable development from which we should all benefit. This is a different vision that is far ahead of the two I have mentioned. It is a demanding and critical vision that is at the root of the way we are acting with regard to the forthcoming WTO negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">And this is why we are against sectorial negotiations and are in favour of all-encompassing negotiations. This is why we are in favour of seeing the WTO and its respective negotiations as an instrument for the creation of a fairer society, of a more sustained development, in which mankind is actually the focus of all decision making. And from this point of view, we state here once again the need to respect environmental matters, the need to respect the consumer and the need to respect human as well as social rights. And from this point of view, Mr President, and to end my intervention, we would like to offer all our support and all our cooperation to Commissioner Lamy on the objectives and the strategic viewpoints that he is well aware he needs to uphold in Seattle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the EU is a success story, an economic community which has put its faith in open markets and given people security in the social sphere, together with economic prosperity. However, the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values. To uphold these values and to secure the cultural diversity of Europe are indispensable tasks at a time when the economies of the world are increasingly interrelated. </p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in the way he has introduced the subject of securing the cultural heritage of Europe into the report for the Millennium Round.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, there are two goals. On the one hand, the dynamic development of electronic services ought not to be impeded. On the contrary, it must be facilitated for, like no other branch of industry, it guarantees jobs that are safe for the future, both in Europe and worldwide. On the other hand, we shall have to be in a position to support and promote the diversity of our European cultural heritage in the future too, and this by means of promotional measures taken also by the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The Schwaiger report facilitates both goals. It has therefore earned broad support from us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While stressing that we must have a WTO Millennium Round that is as comprehensive as possible so that everybody can get something out of it, there are three issues I would like to draw attention to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that Parliament, the Commission and the Council have highlighted animal welfare in their presentations. It is an important issue for citizens, it is an important issue for many of us here in this House and it is important that it is debated at Seattle. I think we must also learn the lessons of the multilateral agreement on investments. Yes, it will be possible for competition and investment to be dealt with at Seattle, but it is important that they are dealt with in a transparent and open way. The WTO must explain to its citizens what it is doing or it will run the risk of undermining support for free trade. It is equally important that as broad as possible a consultation is actually put in place to enable the different points of view to be heard and to be understood when we deal with competition and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">And, thirdly, there is the dispute settlement system itself. It was an undoubted success of the Uruguay Round, but there are problems associated with it. Seattle must close those loopholes, again on the basis of transparency and greater certainty about the rights and obligations of all those involved in the dispute settlement system. That will offer us a key potential for unlocking world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion we must never lose sight of the fact that globalisation is very much about human issues, it is about standards of living, the environment, cultural, moral and ethical issues. Some fear the WTO, some fear globalisation, some fear the advance of growth, markets, technology and science. But I believe by working together openly with the common goal of raising the quality of life for the whole world, we can actually confound the critics of globalisation and show that globalisation and liberalisation can genuinely be a decisive force for good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are confronted with generally slackening growth, and that in a world with an exploding population There are six billion people in the world; one billion are hungry; and more than 30 million people die of starvation each year, including – horrifically – many children. And we, the rich of this world, have a duty to try to reduce this misery and hunger. </p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that a further liberalisation and expansion of trade in the framework provided by the WTO will contribute to promoting growth and employment in the developing countries as well. </p>
<p class="contents">As general rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for the WTO negotiations, I should particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger for his clear words on the subject of trade and the environment. It was not straightforward.

Today, this assessment has still not been made and there is a simple reason for that: it would not be a positive one. It would say that we should kill off liberal dogmas, as well as the old theory which says that wealth is created by developing trade. In 50 years, the volume of trade has increased seventeen-fold, whereas we have only produced twice as many goods in the world. It would also kill off the idea which says that the future of third-world countries would be improved. Inequalities have continued to increase there as they have in our own countries. It would say that we should change course, and that is what we are asking you to do, Commissioner. Changing course means firstly obtaining, by means of the existing package, the one that has already been negotiated, real social and environmental regulations, instead of vague references to standards that are never applied. Yes, that means setting up a logical approach in opposition to ecological and social dumping. This assessment would say “Beware, so as not to open up Pandora’s box in other sectors and I am thinking here particularly of investments. This Parliament has said “no” to the MAI for sound reasons and you, Commissioner, must uphold these arguments in order to prevent the investment sector experiencing the disasters we have seen happen in other areas. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this assessment would condemn the patentability of “living things” and the fact that plants and life itself are becoming saleable commodities. The 20th century has been characterised by a fundamental crisis of humanism as a result of xenophobia and acts of genocide. I would not like to see the 21st century also characterised by a crisis of humanity on account of the all-powerful principles of money and the market taking precedence over the development of mankind and over the fundamental values that make human life what it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot of people are now criticising the World Trade Organisation for looking too one-sidedly at trade, for seeing trade as an end in itself and for failing to see the complex connections between trade, human rights and environmental considerations. I agree with parts of these criticisms but I do not draw the conclusion that we do not need a new trade round. On the contrary, I believe that the status quo is not something we can profit by. Instead, we have everything to gain from a new round because there is so much greater understanding today of these complex connections and of the fact that development questions and environmental questions have to be discussed in the one context. I would remind you of the World Trade Organisation’s latest report which deals very perceptively with just such environmental questions. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to consider two special aspects of what we are discussing. The Commission rightly says that the present round is to be a development round. In a situation in which the level of aid is declining, I find it difficult to see, however, how this is going to be the case if we do not see a radical change. There are some who see a contradiction between aid and trade. They say that trade should help the poorest countries to get out of the situation they are in. I think that the question has been put in the wrong way. We need both: aid as well as trade. We must therefore link these questions to our aid work. </p>
<p class="contents">Increased trade can, of course, have a positive effect on the environment, for example through the transfer of technology adapted to environmental requirements. The opposite may, however, also apply, mainly because our economic framework is not good at taking due account of environmental consequences. That is why it is so important that the trade regulations should take increased account of these factors. The question, when we now read this report and make every kind of demand upon the World Trade Organisation, is simply that of whether the World Trade Organisation can settle all conceivable disputes in the future. I believe – and this is an important conclusion – that, parallel to our making the World Trade Organisation “greener”, we must also strengthen the international conventions on the environment. The fact is that they are far too weak at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The liberalisation of world trade is a positive process that generates growth and that can be hindered, not only by the protectionist practices of the States, but also by the creation of situations where competition is distorted, such as in the event of the abuse of dominant positions, cartels and dumping – think of the example of the shipbuilding industry – which are so harmful to Europe. This is something that is largely new for the World Trade Organisation, but I think it extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, a new area for talks should be the quest to open up national markets to foreign investments. It is important that the Schwaiger report and Parliament recognise the World Trade Organisation as the appropriate forum for serious negotiations on investments, seeking certainty and clarity of the law on the protection of investments, but also, obviously, the protection of state legislation in social, environmental and cultural fields. </p>
<p class="contents">The Schwaiger report understandably puts more emphasis on safeguards, but I think that it is generally in harmony with the Commission proposal and therefore expresses full confidence in Commissioner Lamy’s work with regard to this sensitive topic as well, in full awareness that the liberalisation of international trade, even in new fields – as with investments – is an important concern for the countries of the European Union and all the countries which have an interest in lasting and sustainable development of the global economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, the bilateral agreement that the United States has signed with China to prepare the way for China to join the World Trade Organisation must be regarded by the European Union, aside from as an important contribution to the multilateral process, also, and above all, as a fundamental opportunity to monitor the substantial importance that human rights have and will have regarding the opportunities afforded by a market that enjoys such enormous potential as the Chinese market. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember, in this regard, that the 174 member countries of the ILO which, with the solemn declaration of 1998, undertook to comply with the four categories of fundamental labour rights, even where they did not ratify the conventions, are, in the main, also members of the WTO. Now, since the international bodies are what the Member States want them to be, it is legitimate to ask these same States to behave in a consistent manner throughout the fora. The desirable entry of China, which the European Union is also actively negotiating for, will certainly make the WTO more representative and will extend the potential ability to realise global free trade that is also regulated. Nevertheless, that does not mean deluding ourselves that many of the problems regarding fundamental rights in China have now been resolved or are being resolved, nor ignoring the fact that, in the past, the United States itself has had double standards regarding the request for the social clause to be complied with. It is, however, better that it is possible for the attempt to affirm these rights to be made within the walls of the international institutions, rather than in bilateral fora, according to what is convenient at the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many third-world countries have objected to this, as this practice makes deep inroads into the very existence of millions of farmers. If applications for patents could be made on existing agricultural crops, this would mean farmers becoming more dependent on large companies. They would need to pay for sowing seed, which would affect their very raison d’être. As a result of this, food safety would be in the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">A large group of third-world countries, Kenya being the spokesperson, has called for a review of the TRIPS Agreement. In order to accommodate the developing countries, it would be a good idea to actually carry out this review. But this is not the only reason. From an economic point of view, there are major disadvantages attached to the current practice, as this can lead to a handful of companies being in unacceptable positions of power.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also ethical objections to the patenting of live organisms. These objections have also been tabled in the Council when the Biotechnology Directive was laid down. This is why I would like to ask Commissioner Lamy, and Parliament, to take seriously the objections raised by third-world countries, but also the ethical and economic objections raised within Europe. An assessment of the present regulation would be a first step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Trade Organisation is a European idea, one to which the Americans were converted in Marrakech, after having opposed it for a long time. With regard to Seattle, it is the Europeans, not the Americans who are proposing the greater agenda: the Millennium Round is our idea. It is the Europeans, not the Americans, who have gained the most from previous negotiations. Since 1995 the United States’ trade deficit towards us has grown spectacularly: almost USD 30 billion last year. Anyway, the issue is not unregulated trade, but quite the opposite, to ensure that the formidable growth of trade serves everyone’s long-term development and not just the predatory enrichment of the strongest. </p>
<p class="contents">We want increased levels of trade and the elimination of the many barriers that still remain in some countries for some goods and for most services. We want fair trade for everyone and by that I mean equal conditions for competition. They are not equal in agriculture, or in cultural sectors. There must be rules for competition and a court to ensure that they are respected, and that means by the strongest, too, with regard to the weakest. Finally, we want trade that benefits sustainable development, by creating a link between trade agreements and our other major international commitments on fundamental labour rights, on food safety and on environmental protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Basically, we have to undertake, on a worldwide scale, the course of action that enabled us to succeed in Europe when we moved from the Customs Union to the Single Area, and that is why Europe has the most to bring to the negotiations and has the right to expect the most from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has presented a good report. The report addresses the important points and says, above all, that we in principle support the Commission and the Council. However, we are clearer about some points than the Commission and the Council have been so far. I am speaking, for example, about environmental standards. </p>
<p class="contents">What we want, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, is for attention not only to be given to environmental damage caused in Europe by products from other countries. We also want more thorough discussion of processes and production methods (PPM) in other countries and to talk not only about labelling but also about how, through trade sanctions, we can prevent worldwide damage to the environment from taking place. In fact, the Liberals have submitted a very good Amendment to the Committee, and this may be found as number 47 in the resolution we have before us. </p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of being able to impose trade sanctions relating to production methods whenever there is a danger of worldwide damage to the environment. The WTO’s Shrimps-Turtle judgement at least presents an attempt to argue along these lines, for the Shrimps look alike whether or not they have been caught in accordance with the rules concerning animal protection. The WTO has said: in principle, this can be discussed. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we also discuss climate protection in this context, for the world decided in Rio in 1992 and in Kyoto in 1997 that this is a huge problem and that we must tackle it together. There must, therefore, also be opportunities to implement climate protection measures in the WTO. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to support all those who have come out in favour of a courageous position in respect of the least developed countries, the LLDC. I should like, however, to emphasise that these are not only ACP countries but that there are also many countries outside the ACP area to which we must provide better support. I am among those who argue that all products should be completely free from customs duties and that we should not be defining so-called sensitive products, only then to make exceptions of them again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot shake off the impression I have that the desiderata of the developing countries threaten to be pulverised by the desiderata of the major economic blocs. When elephants fight, the grass is trampled underfoot. Africa is all too aware of this. If Europe and the US argue today about genetically modified organisms and the use of hormones and antibiotics in cattle breeding, then improved market access for the developing countries and their involvement in the world economy will threaten to fade into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is up to us to ensure that in a world of liberalised trading, there is room for social and ecological corrections and a gradual and guided involvement of third-world countries in the world economy. Otherwise, we might end up in an American world which only defends commerce with verve, but overlooks the other values of the European dream, namely solidarity alongside competitiveness and responsibility alongside economic growth. Surely it cannot be our intention to render everything subordinate to the one paradigm, which is to be disseminated from Seattle to the rest of the world? Europe, and the European Parliament, in particular, must argue in favour of more equality in world trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of liberalisation of the economy on the development of the third world should be that of the wind that kindles a fire. The wind should be forceful enough, but not too forceful or else it will blow out the fire. In Seattle, we will help blow the bellows of the world economy. In my opinion, the excellent report of Mr Schwaiger indicates very well how we can reach out to the developing countries. I will therefore give it all my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attacks against the World Trade Organisation are significant, and the trade disputes we are experiencing and being drawn into are alarming. To be one-sidedly passionate about one’s own region’s traditions and characteristic ways of doing things by imposing restrictions in the context of trade policy is to risk removing the basis for trade and development and for the dissemination of knowledge, culture and prosperity. In the longer term, it can also lead to suspicion, stagnation and conflicts. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Schwaiger report, which our excellent rapporteur has worked very thoroughly on, many Members of the European Parliament have devoted energy to tackling all the problems and disturbing elements which free trade is alleged to give rise to. I would therefore emphasise the contributions of free trade to reducing poverty and encouraging growth and the processes of democratisation. The power for development entailed in free trade and competition is something we cannot turn our backs on in the era of globalisation. The overriding task of the EU’s representatives in Seattle must therefore be that of continuing with the liberalisation of world trade. </p>
<p class="contents">The new industries have relied upon the sets of regulations offered by the World Trade Organisation. In this way, they have been able to create prosperity in a very much better way than they would have done by means of endless subsidies from the rich man’s table. </p>
<p class="contents">Protectionist measures would now prevent imports from these developing countries and limit the latter’s opportunities to contribute to the international division of labour. A policy of protecting markets therefore leads to a deterioration in working conditions in the poorer countries and runs counter to the kind of development we want to promote, that is to say improved living conditions achieved through growth and free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union, through its earlier decisions, has been committed to consistency in different areas of policy. Thus, for example, trade policy must be in harmony with the Union’s policies on developing countries and the environment. Both areas of policy are now emphatically raised in the report and, as a new Member of Parliament, I can say that it comes as a pleasant surprise. Similarly, I could say that the proposed report gives a very balanced account of the position of the WTO in relationship to other multilateral treaties. In addition, strong support for the cooperation that has begun between the ILO and the WTO promises an even better level of coherence in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Once a working model has been found, it should also be applied to the way the WTO relates to other international organisations, which have overseen the drafting of similar agreements. It is also important that Parliament now outlines the importance of these multilateral agreements in the WTO’s dispute settlement procedure. As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I am satisfied that we are trying to include the precautionary principle in the set of rules of the WTO. The Union’s negotiators must be able to convince the other sides that the EU goal is not protectionism but the safeguarding of the welfare of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union would be wise to invite NGOs to discussions about the WTO while the round of talks is proceeding. Not only would it strengthen the legitimacy of Union action on our own turf, but the global NGO arena itself could help our negotiators to achieve the goals of the Union. Experience shows that debate in the NGO arena easily spreads from one continent to another. As the other sides unfortunately lag far behind, the EU needs the backing of the NGOs in its work to transform the WTO into a sustainable organisation in the areas of the environment, health and social welfare. At the Seattle round, the scope and power of the WTO will grow significantly, and that is why the EU should ensure that the effects of the liberalisation of trade and the action of the WTO are continually appraised from the point of view of ecology and fairness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bigger EU States like France, Germany and the United Kingdom traded about 30% of GDP in the 1960s as against 60% today, but they enjoyed much faster economic growth at that time than they do now. From 1950 to 1970 world economic growth and the expansion of world trade ran roughly in tandem, but since then economic growth has been increasing at only half the pace of world exports: so again there is no evidence there that increased trade leads automatically to further economic growth. It is quite obvious, of course, that small countries like Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg need free trade, but a European Union with a single market or a North American single market is an entirely different proposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless I believe in free trade. Because of the way the world is changing, globalisation is unstoppable unless, of course, we erect iron curtains or bamboo curtains, and those too would be blown away by the winds of change. Globalisation is happening and while there are risks it presents us with immense opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The first opportunity is to create a partnership for cooperation and the management of the increased trading activities. Decision making in this way is not to by-pass democracy, it is to extend democracy. It is a new means by which to organise the activities of mankind. Behind our trade barriers there is the risk that we will cultivate the seeds of more international conflict. The rich could dig in behind their barriers, they could buy some essential things from the poorer countries but we would be back to the seventeenth century with the strong exploiting the weak. Those who are concerned about human rights, animal welfare and the environment have a much better prospect of securing improvements in those areas within a legal framework and a World Trade Organisation than they have in a free-for-all, law of the jungle.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on putting together what I regard as a decent framework within which to move forward. There will be risks, but we have to explain to our people why we cannot do other than proceed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate on the Schwaiger report could not have come at a better time because we are right now in the middle of extremely lively discussions on the preparation of the Seattle agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">Next, as the Union’s negotiator, I would like to express my pleasure at the Schwaiger report. Its adoption will send a clear signal to our partners’, by confirming that the European Union will not be satisfied with a minimalist approach which only aims to improve market access in some sectors. This would not provide a response either to our fellow citizens’ concerns or to the legitimate demands of developing countries. Going by what you have said today, your vote tomorrow will strengthen our hand and thus the Union’s hand in Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the debate on trade has changed the approach that we are taking, as the Schwaiger report shows. It is, admittedly, true that we want to continue to liberalise trade, which has been and still is a strategic factor in our prosperity. But the next round of negotiations must also address new issues, such as development, the environment, health and food safety, fundamental social standards, competition and its transparency, minimal rules in terms of investment and the promotion of cultural diversity. The addition of all these elements leads us to recommend a broader round of negotiations, and I am delighted to see the broad agreement on this matter between the Commission and Parliament which is shown in your report, Mr Schwaiger. </p>
<p class="contents">Some of you do not agree with this approach and propose a kind of moratorium on negotiations. I do not think that this is a valid solution. Firstly because we have commitments that must be respected in the follow-up to the Uruguay Round. Secondly, we must carefully weigh up the risks of a moratorium. If we do not advance further along the route towards multilateral liberalisation, that means leaving the way open for unilateral action by the strongest. Is this really the outcome that those calling for a moratorium want to see? </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, why should we postpone negotiation on the rules which our society is rightly calling for and that developing countries are expecting in order to integrate the liberalisation of trade and sustainable development into areas such as health, the environment and workers’ fundamental rights? </p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore convinced that these negotiations are necessary, but I recognise – and moreover I am delighted that this is the case – that the very conditions of these negotiations have changed in relation to the previous round. Given the concerns expressed by a growing number of our fellow citizens with regard to globalisation, we must have a public debate that is more wide-ranging, more transparent and more interactive. In this respect, I think that the discussions held when the Schwaiger report was being prepared, both within Parliament and between Parliament and the Commission, have been exemplary. This is why I feel I must pay tribute to Mr Schwaiger who has accomplished a Herculean task by drawing up, from your many proposals, a compromise version that I hope you will vote for tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to respond to the debate, I would like briefly to mention a few issues which have come to light in the preparation of this report. On the subject, first, of developing countries, it has become clear that the countries that have benefited the least from the establishment of the WTO and from the results of the Uruguay Round are also, without exception, those who are the least integrated into the world trade system. We therefore have to encourage their participation with a view to encouraging their integration, instead of delaying. Where integration does not go ahead primarily because of a lack of resources or inadequate expertise, then developing countries must be given technical and financial assistance in order to increase their negotiating ability and to apply the measures decided on within the WTO. On the other hand, when non-integration is a result of domestic policies or of poor development, extending deadlines for implementation or providing more and more preferential measures are not ideal solutions. Special and differentiated treatment is, admittedly, essential for developing countries, but it must encourage these countries to implement strategies for sustainable development and not exempt them from such strategies. </p>
<p class="contents">A new approach is necessary with regard to relations with ACP countries, for example, one that must, in particular, achieve convergence towards WTO rules, because the current system must be reviewed, in any case, even if we have to make the necessary transitional changes. </p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of intellectual property, we are convinced that the regulations in this field must enable developing countries to themselves benefit from the resources available to them and that the current measures already go a long way towards achieving this. A top-to-toe revision of the agreement would not therefore be a good idea. On the other hand, if we take a coherent view of the link between intellectual property and development, we must, at the same time as extending its guarantees, ensure that we encourage direct investment as the principle means of transferring technology to these countries, as well as developing agreements with them for technological cooperation and perhaps, and this is just a suggestion, thinking about strengthening European investment in fundamental research on living things, in order to share the profits with them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of the environment, there are many concerns focusing on the applicability of environmental measures in relation to WTO rules. The ideal solution is to be found, of course, in multilateral negotiations on a hierarchy of norms. As we well know, it is not within reach. In the meantime, we must work hard to ensure that each of the new standards is linked to the previous ones so that, if needs be, the judges to whom disputes are referred are not given too wide a scope for interpretation. One of our goals is to guarantee mutual compatibility in this context, which would allow environmental or other measures to be implemented in accordance with WTO rules. </p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle is another subject that concerns many of you. It is obviously up to each member of the WTO to decide if there is a risk or not. The precautionary principle must then allow that country to take the appropriate measures in order to avoid this risk. The most important thing for us therefore is the clarification of the regulations and procedures governing the application of the precautionary principle. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as services are concerned, I note the concerns that have been expressed. I would like to reassure you on this point. In no case do I have the mandate to accept, by means of an international negotiation, a threat to the power of the Union’s governments to regulate these areas or to be active in them. We recognise the essential and crucial role that these services play in our society. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, until now we have faced a position on the part of the Cairns group which aims to put agricultural products in the same category as other goods. This is not the position we hold. This is not what was agreed in 1994 by all parties involved and which we have respected. We will have to start again from the idea that agriculture has other functions apart from producing goods for the market. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us finally examine the question of social standards. In all countries, globalisation makes its effects felt in the social sphere, but it must also be pointed out that in a number of less advanced countries, international labour standards agreed on under the International Labour Organisation are not being sufficiently respected. The mention of social standards arouses reactions in some of our WTO partners, particularly among developing countries, which are, and I can vouch for this, extremely heated. It is crucial that, from now on, we begin by restating our opposition to the imposition of trade sanctions in the social sphere as well as to any use of sanctions for protectionist reasons. To our mind, the very raison d’être of respecting workers’ fundamental rights is the fairer distribution of profits from the growth that liberalisation of trade brings. It is, moreover, bearing this concern in mind, that our plan of widely applied preferences allows us to provide free-standing reductions to countries that effectively apply the main ILO conventions. </p>
<p class="contents">The important thing for us in Seattle, and I think that we are all in agreement on this, is to make discussion of the matter possible in the context of cooperation between the ILO and the WTO. By the way, I would also like to confirm our support for the presence of Mr Somavia in Seattle as a positive sign of the importance given to this subject. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word or two about China, Mr President, before I finish. I have not spoken publicly on this matter while I have been waiting for this debate. Is the signing by the Americans and the Chinese of an agreement on access to the WTO, as several of you have asked, good news or not such good news? From the point of view first of those who question the whole WTO, it is not good news. China, a country whose development is crucial for the future of the world, is giving a clear sign that it wishes to adhere to a multilateral trade system. </p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of our multilateral interests as well as of our own interests, everything depends on the contents of the agreement that has been signed, as the American Congress wanted to be the first to hear the contents of this agreement, a procedure to which your Parliament should have been more sympathetic than hostile, even if it makes my life more difficult. I am sorry to say that information about the details only reaches me in dribs and drabs. Now the devil, or perhaps the dragon, in this case, is in the detail. I have no reason today to doubt the good faith of the American negotiators with whom our people have been working hard and to good effect for the last two years on our common interests. Nor do I have any reason to suspect that concessions on multilateral conditions that are important to us have been paid for in bilateral money that is not legal tender for us. Supposing that this were not the case, we should still have to negotiate with the Chinese on matters in which the Union has a particular interest. To sum up, it is probably good news, subject to receiving proper details of the contents, which are being prepared. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude my intervention Mr President, by welcoming the members of your institution who are part of our delegation to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. This is part of a tradition that I am happy to uphold. Moreover, tomorrow, I shall be meeting those MEPs that you will be appointing as delegates for Seattle, and I hope that you will have done so by tomorrow, and we will be able to discuss in greater detail the courses of action that we shall carry out once we are there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
