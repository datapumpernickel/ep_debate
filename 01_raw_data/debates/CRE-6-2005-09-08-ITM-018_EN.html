Climate changes on the planet, as demonstrated in the case of New Orleans and with the prolonged drought and temperature increase in Africa, do most damage to underdeveloped countries and poor populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders of the members of the UN due to meet in New York must realise at long last where their responsibilities lie and must move from pronouncements to specific actions. The dramatic famine which the people of Africa are suffering imposes the need to plan global strategic aid, not belated mercy actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective set by G8, primarily to combat poverty and hunger in Africa, is linked to direct and bold decisions. However, it is undermined by the very stance of its members. A typical example is the continuing delay in actually writing off the debts of the poor countries. The anarchic liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural products is widening the gap between developed and developing countries. The global food crisis is now of a structural nature. It is threatening stability and needs international structural intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, although humanitarian aid needs to be increased, it cannot answer Africa's serious problems. The crisis in Niger has confirmed the serious deficit in the UN and the European Union of early warning and prevention mechanisms. As the case of Niger demonstrates, this deficit is causing a huge increase in financing for ex-post humanitarian intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, any strategy still based solely on generous international humanitarian aid – Mr Anan has called for a tenfold increase in the UN Assistance Fund – will not be effective in the long term unless the international community starts a 'green revolution' in Africa. Far-reaching changes and reforms in the state, society, the economy and agricultural production are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has important comparative advantages in Africa and must put the important decisions it took at the Council of Ministers on 24 May 2005 into practice.</p>

In actual fact, I myself sent a letter to you in April in which I questioned you about the threat of famine in Niger. I also seize this opportunity to thank you for your response. Yet there we have it, we always have to wait to see horrific images on our screens before we intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, only in June, the government of Niger, which has long denied the scale of the crisis, refused the free distribution of emergency food rations, in order, it said, to avoid destabilising the market, when we know full well that the poorest people were unable to obtain and afford these reasonably priced, subsidised food products.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore keep coming back to the same question: what are we doing for this dying, declining Africa? Admittedly, the world has finally turned its attention to the fate of Niger. Aid is finally there. The donors realised that this crisis was a real famine, affecting a third of the population of Niger, or 3.6 million people, which is a huge number. What we can still call for in our resolution is for aid reserved for these populations to be equal to demand and, of course, to reach the most vulnerable people without exception. Yet on that subject too, I am not telling you anything you do not already know.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring in particular to the nomadic populations, for example, who are not necessarily on the lists of the World Food Programme and who have lost almost all of their livestock, which is itself also dying of hunger. Consequently, a number of suicides have been recorded among the Fulani, a proud people who cannot bear to beg. This famine also reminds us that we must conduct a real development aid policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am very well aware that you can back up words with figures and actions. Therefore, what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger? For Africa? What about support for agricultural exports? All these questions will constantly be asked, but I believe that, one of these days, they really will have to be resolved at European Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One distinctive feature sets the African continent as a whole apart from Europe. There is a constant stream of hundreds and thousands of people crossing the continent’s borders, which were only firmly established in the first half of the 20th century, and this phenomenon is entirely impossible to control. Many people travel with their livestock and all their belongings, particularly in the Sahel region, to which Niger belongs, and this is why crises spread so rapidly between the various countries in this region. A great many people who are familiar with Niger’s abundant natural resources, such as the large deposits of uranium ore that are mined in the country, would be surprised to learn where the profits from these activities end up. Measures to reduce corruption and to bring pressure to bear on the country’s government to put budgetary resources to efficient use are therefore a logical and necessary first step.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no denying that the imposition of VAT on flour and milk could make things worse as far as food supplies are concerned. The fundamental error, however, is the lack of support for modern agriculture, based on the construction of irrigation systems and water resources for the development of crop production. The widespread practice of nomadic pastoralism, which is particularly common in the northern part of the country, leads to desertification and an escalation of the crisis over the years. What is more, the fact that nomads travel across borders could result in the crisis spreading to other countries, in particular Mali and Burkina Faso.</p>
<p class="contents">Two decisions must therefore be taken without delay. The first must be to address the immediate need for food aid, and the second to develop a broad-based programme for constructing irrigation and water resources. An essential addition to this programme must be a system for teaching a sufficient number of farmers about rational agricultural practices, based on crop production methods that benefit the area in question. In addition, trees must be planted in order to prevent desertification. It is likely that the most difficult task will be to restrict the practice of pastoralism in areas that are most at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Other countries in the region must also be involved in this programme, since we will otherwise be faced with an ever-increasing number of related problems as the desert spreads south. Food supplies only provide a short-term solution to the problem, and a broader solution needs to be found in the long term. Pressure to liberalise public services and to open markets up rapidly is quite clearly not what is needed, and could make the situation even more critical in the near future. During the vote, we should therefore endeavour to adopt a resolution worded in such a way that it can act as the basis for a genuine resolution of the problems faced both by Niger and by the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are ways of tackling this crisis which do not risk damaging the local economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGO Oxfam, for example, is operating income creation schemes so that people can afford to buy food. Oxfam has reduced the number of weak animals by buying them at a fair price and slaughtering them. It is also using voucher-for-work schemes, covering activities such as the removal of animal carcasses, drying of slaughtered meat and reforestation.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Niger this year is not exceptional; for many people, the hunger they now face is only a slight worsening of what they see every year. Despite short rains and locust infestation, food production this year was in fact only 11 % below the five-year average. Therefore, the real question is not what caused the crisis this year, but what is causing endemic hunger and poverty. The answer to that is complex; there are reports that, in the villages where women and children are starving, grain is lying in locked household stores, which women are forbidden by custom to enter. We often talk about the importance of the role of women, but there can be no starker an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are powerless. Only one in four girls attend primary school in Niger; if girls start to go to school then women will start to break into their own grain stores.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we in Europe are making the long-term problem worse because of our failure to take strong enough action on climate change. All the agricultural improvement programmes ever invented will be useless if the desertification of the Sahel continues. Overgrazing and deforestation are factors, but so is the rise in the world's temperature. So let us have some joined-up thinking here in the European Parliament. Next time we are discussing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, let us remember marginal lands and famine in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said, 'Niger has sent us a message in the whimpers of children too malnourished to cry for help'. He also said, 'Sadly, the spotlight has already shifted and donations have again dried up.' That is the problem. 2.7 million people in Niger are in urgent need of food aid. There is growing concern that, while food aid distribution continues across the worst affected parts of the country, financial support for emergency operations is tailing off. In the second half of August the WFP only received two donations. Funding for its emergency operation is still under 50% and $29.6 million are still needed to deliver the aid required.</p>
<p class="contents">A food crisis is complex. Weather patterns, food production, markets, technologies, sanitation, health care, education and child-rearing practices have all played their role. Last year's drought coupled with the invasion of locusts, followed by drought this year, have combined with an increase in food prices, which have tripled in rural areas and doubled in cities, partly as a result of demand from neighbouring countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the view of the MSF, which has been critical of the slow response, first by the Government of Niger and then by the UN. The WFP only expects to deliver food rations to 110 000 people, 10% of the worst-affected area's 1.2 million. The concern is that the food distribution is not reaching those in the greatest need, especially children under five, and the food being distributed is not appropriate for the young children and infants who are the main victims of this current epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned, too, that the crisis will spread to the other countries in the region. The wider Sahel and northern areas of Mali are already suffering and in Burkina Faso farmers have already lost up to 90% of their harvest and are having to sell their cattle to raise money for basic foods. We need urgent action and we need it now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Niger almost defies description – a country of 12 million people afflicted on a regular, ongoing basis by all manner of natural disasters, compounded by domestic error and international indifference until it is too late, and by incoherence on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It was hoped that the G8 Summit, which we in Scotland hosted, would take some brave steps towards providing an ongoing framework, perhaps giving the Commission a lead for ongoing, coherent, constructive engagement with countries like Niger. We were sorely disappointed, but at least the debt relief announced was a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our role in this House to monitor that those words are actually turned into action. Perhaps we can discuss that at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which – I am delighted to say – will be coming to Edinburgh in November. We in this House must play our part in providing a coherent framework and I look forward to working with the Commission on that basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ours is a world in which it has been calculated that a child dies of starvation every seven minutes, despite the great advances made in technology, research, production and new techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">No one present here today can even begin to imagine the agony of those dying of starvation, nor can we understand the plight of adults and children reduced to abject poverty. Niger is not the only place where this is happening. Other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and indeed elsewhere in the world are similarly afflicted. Niger itself is currently suffering from drought and a plague of locusts. As a result, five million people are starving, and over one million, including children, are in imminent danger of dying of starvation. This should weigh heavily on all our consciences. In particular, it should weigh on the consciences of those governed solely by the profit motive, who resort to market principles restricting food production, with scant regard for inalienable human rights, human dignity and moral principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-heralded success stories propounded amongst other places from this House have become an indictment in the face of the <span class="italic">de facto</span> globalisation of poverty and the threat posed to the peaceful coexistence of nations. Debates like the one we are engaged in today will change nothing, nor will humanitarian aid handed out by the very rich G8 countries, for whom Africa seems to have become a priority. Debt relief and a long-term development policy are required, and also a spirit of solidarity with countries in the developing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the food crisis that Niger is currently sustaining is intolerable. It is intolerable because populations, and children in particular, are starving and are in vital need of aid. Yet, the way in which this crisis has been exploited to criticise the slowness of the donors and to accuse them of failing to provide aid to people in danger, prompts me to make a handful of remarks aimed simply at presenting an objective analysis of the prevailing situation in Niger and at offering accurate information, at least with regard to European aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Niger is one of the poorest countries on the planet. It forms part of the driest region of the Sahel, where the supply of food is always in the balance. Security of the food supply in Niger is extremely fragile and there are recurring malnutrition problems. The slightest climatic uncertainty, such as rain failures or indeed the destruction of crops by predators, be they birds or locusts, the slightest market price disruption immediately gives rise to food shortage problems. People use up their stocks too soon, storehouses are empty from April and food products become scarce at the markets or are sold at soaring prices. People have to wait until the following harvest in September or October, always assuming, of course, that there is a proper rainy season. The crisis that we are currently facing is, however, more severe than in previous years. The invasions of locusts at the end of the summer of 2004 and the poor rainfall in several areas of the Sahel, and particularly in certain regions of Niger, resulted in a very poor harvest.</p>
<p class="contents">As far back as September 2004, the Commission released EUR 25.5 million for the anti-locust campaign in the most affected countries of the Sahel, that is to say Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Mali and Niger, and funds have been allocated to the FAO (the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation).</p>
<p class="contents">As far back as February/March 2005, the warning signs of a difficult food shortage emerged in Niger. There was a rapid increase in the price of grain, a drop in the price of livestock, a mass and premature transhumance of herds and a shortage of local food products at the markets. In March, the Government of Niger, relying on information from the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises, broadly supported by the Commission, released money to buy 42 000 tonnes of grain resold cheaply, and distributed food in return for work requiring high-intensity labour. For its part, the World Food Programme, intervening in support of the national agency, launched an appeal for a sum of EUR 2.3 million, to which the Commission responded immediately with an allocation of EUR 1 million. At that time, no one, not the government, the WFP or the NGOs, were able, due to the lack of precise overall data, to assess whether it was a slightly more difficult crisis than in previous years or a serious food crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission consequently made contact with aid organisations to ascertain their analysis, and, above all, their plan, as we did not receive any request for funding at that time. None of the NGOs, and none of the operating bodies with which we currently work, contacted us to make an appeal to us, as is usually the case, given that, as you know, the Commission itself does not participate in this type of intervention operation.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only at the end of May and beginning of June that the nutritional surveys carried out in certain areas of the country revealed the crisis underway. It was then that the humanitarian partners appeared. The Commission thus took two urgent decisions, through ECHO, to release a total amount of EUR 6.3 million. That is the chronology of events.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation today? A recent ECHO evaluation mission concluded that nutritional requirements are today being met to a satisfactory degree, even though there is some delay in implementing the aid. The Commission is obviously prepared to step up its aid if additional needs emerge. At present, what is needed is effective coordination between the partners on the ground to enable them to target areas successfully and to speed up the aid. The European Commission has also released EUR 2 million for Mali, EUR 4.6 million for Eritrea and EUR 4.5 million for Ethiopia, countries that have also been affected by food and nutrition crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis concerns us, and calls for us all to learn the lessons from it in full. For my part, I can see two main lessons. With regard to Niger first of all, it is crucial that, in addition to humanitarian efforts, a long-lasting solution be found to addressing the country’s vulnerability, by enhancing the food security strategy. That is precisely the policy that has been adopted by the Commission over many years in an attempt to respond to this crisis on a long-term basis. I am mainly referring to irrigation projects, projects to build reservoirs and so forth, which benefit from Community funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Niger’s national early warning systems and mechanisms for detecting food shortages must be supported and enhanced. Rural development and market organisation programmes form part of this objective, as do school meals. The Commission is Niger’s principal donor. The ninth EDF has enabled this country to benefit from a funding package of nearly EUR 400 million, including EUR 60.6 million for developing food security. The budget heading ‘food security’ is devoting EUR 15 million to a support programme (2004 to 2006) for the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises. But for a handful of European countries, the Commission is, however, practically alone in helping this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The debates, which will begin next year, on allocations after the ninth EDF will without doubt take account of the lessons learnt from this food crisis. Yet, it must be stated right now that, whatever the Commission may do for Niger, the challenge remains immense. It will be difficult to rise to it without more substantial development aid from the entire international community. Increasing the funding for development aid is, as you know, the Commission’s priority, and that is the message we will deliver in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the response from the international aid organisations, I regret to observe that it could have been better coordinated and been the subject of greater coordination with the Government of Niger and among the aid organisations, be they NGOs or United Nations agencies, and whether at the warning and detection stage or at the stage of responding to the crisis and targeting needs. The Commission is prepared to give its backing to an independent evaluation aimed at identifying the means for improving aid coordination in a similar situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about donor action. I confess to being troubled – I do not disguise the fact – by the remarks made by certain humanitarian organisations. As a donor, the Commission could have acted more swiftly if, in the spring, it had discovered, there at the scene, the humanitarian organisations it had hoped to find. I note, however, that, once the media machine snowballed, there was no longer any difficulty in finding partners prepared to come to Niger. I have always paid tribute to the expertise and commitment of the humanitarian organisations that are our partners, but the remarks that I heard from a number of them about the food crises in Africa, whether in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa or South Africa, asserting that the problem was due to the inadequate donor response, surprised me. It is pushing it, intellectually, to argue along those lines. The food crises in Africa – as you are very well aware – are complex phenomena that are the result of several factors: the climate, demographics, the state of health of the populations – one only has to think, for example, of the disastrous effects of AIDS in southern Africa as a result of lower physical resistance – political governance and economic governance. To claim that donor aid would be enough to prevent these crises does not appear to me to be entirely fair. It is also, furthermore, a slightly paternalistic and moralistic attitude, which I reject.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that the Commission will remain extremely vigilant, and I hope that, from now on, when we become aware of a problem and an appeal is made, we will find operator and partner organisations to enable us to work more swiftly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
