<p class="contents">In introducing this debate, I must emphasise how Solidarity’s contribution to the events leading to a united Europe may be seen as a chance and an opportunity for a generation to learn about freedom: the West certainly did much for the countries of Eastern Europe under the Soviet yoke, but Solidarity has perhaps done much more for the West and for a generation of Westerners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The action led at that time by Solidarność is a symbol of the value that all Europeans attach to the shared values of freedom and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the courage and determination of the leaders of Solidarność and the inspiration it provided to so many, the influence of the strike of shipyard workers in Gdansk did not stop at the Polish borders. It brought fresh sap to the many buds of dissent and democracy which were then burgeoning throughout central and eastern Europe and which allowed the unification of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As was mentioned by the President of the Commission in Gdansk on 31 August, 'Solidarity' was an inspired choice of name for the union which was born from the strike in Gdansk. It conveyed strength, determination and focus. Solidarity is today one of the six titles of the European Charter for Fundamental Rights. The remembrance of the events of August 1980 enriches this word with meaning and emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom was what Solidarność fought for and it is today also closely associated with solidarity as a fundamental value shared by Europeans. There is no Europe without solidarity. Solidarność is a meaningful symbol to remind future generations of Europeans of this alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been happy to contribute to the commemorative events which took place in Gdansk three weeks ago, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of these historic events, upon the invitation of the Polish Government and of the honourable Members of this Parliament. The Commission will listen to the views of this House; and, be assured, will look favourably on initiatives aiming to mark 31 August with the seal of remembrance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, for Poland, it meant breaking free from the foreign Soviet model. Secondly, for Central and Eastern Europe it meant doing away with the division of Europe effected at Yalta at the end of the Second World War. As a result, the part of Europe cut off from the rest of Europe by Communism was able to regain its rightful place in the mainstream of our continent’s political history. In this sense, therefore, the events at the Gdansk shipyard, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolution in Kiev are all stages in Europe’s journey to freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, for Western Europe Solidarity meant rediscovering the true meaning of values that had disappeared from public life as a result of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>. I refer to values such as freedom, solidarity, democracy and the dignity of the individual. Thanks to Solidarity, many people in Western Europe came to understand that the fundamental values revived by Solidarity had to become part of the fabric of the reorganised and reunited Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The message and significance of these events transcends the experience of a single nation. They have a far more universal meaning and a pan-European nature. Their message is one of European unity. If the Schuman plan is recognised as the basic premise underpinning European integration, then the Gdansk shipyard demands must be seen as heralding another important stage in the process. In their September 1981 message to workers in Central and Eastern Europe, Solidarity activists wrote about the sense of a common fate uniting all Europeans in the eastern part of our continent. Twenty-five years later that same expression appeared in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, referring on this occasion to the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity movement highlights the importance of solidarity as the basis of any system of trust and unity. Solidarity, understood to mean shouldering each other’s burdens, has a very practical expression indeed as far as the European Union is concerned. It means financial solidarity regarding security and solidarity in foreign policy. Only by displaying such solidarity can we attain European unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of August this action became a general strike affecting the whole country. The action was led and organised by an Inter-enterprise Strike Committee and by Lech Wałęsa at the Gdansk shipyard. Workers and the intelligentsia rebelled in the cause of freedom, social justice and dignity. The slogans of freedom, equality and brotherhood shouted out again from European banners just as they had 200 years earlier in Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">On 31 August an agreement was signed at the Gdansk shipyard. In it, the State authorities agreed to the 21 demands made by the strikers. This led to the emergence of the Independent and Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity. The general strike and Solidarity’s activities became a source of hope for workers the world over in the struggle for workers’ rights, a just society and a better world. Solidarity set off a chain reaction across Eastern Europe, which led eventually to a peaceful democratic revolution and a victory for democracy and human rights. It also meant the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system and the division of Europe, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-five years later, here at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, at the political heart of a united Europe, it is fitting to honour the Polish workers and all those who rebelled against oppression and injustice, and played a part in the creation of the Solidarity Trade Union. Particular recognition is due to those who continued to pursue independent activity after the introduction of martial law in Poland. I would like to pay tribute to all the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, who are to be admired for their struggle in the cause of democracy, human rights and national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we were not alone in this struggle. We recall the help Solidarity received from the international trade union movement, from Western European civil society and from democratic governments. Thank you, Europe! Thanks are also due to all those Europeans who sided with Solidarity and supported our fight for freedom and democracy when we were in prison or driven underground. The European Union should be proud of this heritage, proud of having given such proof of brotherhood. Brotherhood underpins European unity.</p>
<p class="contents">In its programme, namely the 21 Gdansk demands, and also the Self-Governing Republic programme, Solidarity presented a vision of a society and a country bound together by freedom, where human rights were respected and social justice prevailed. This vision remains relevant today. Solidarity’s programme can still serve as an inspiration at global level and also at European level, as Europe tackles the challenge of creating an effective economy and a just society.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s world, Solidarity stands for a refusal to condone poverty and oppression anywhere on the globe. It demands that the European Union act to wipe poverty off the face of the earth. In the 21st century, Solidarity’s message demands a European Union foreign policy that actively promotes democracy and human rights, and support for those who are currently persecuted because they belong to a minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am moved and grateful to note that both the European Parliament and the European Commission appreciate the significance of the events that took place on Polish soil 25 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Polish workers took to their hearts the message of the Polish Pope, who urged them not to have fear. It was Polish workers who took action on behalf of their country, which longed for freedom. In so doing they proved those who believed that the proletariat has no fatherland to be mistaken. The workers took action in the name of freedom, standing up to a regime and a system that claimed to represent them. They made political demands, and called for freedom and the establishment of a free trade union to represent them. The workers also demanded freedom of the press, freedom of information and a state that was not controlled by Communist Party officials. All these demands expressed something crucial to the very essence of Europe, as they were demands for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that when the Gdansk shipyard workers took action to improve their lot and that of their families, they were aware that their situation was the result of an alien regime that had been imposed on them. It was a regime to which the Polish nation had never consented. The amazing achievement of this mass movement of 10 million workers, farm labourers, and members of the intelligentsia was a peaceful revolution. It was a movement that encompassed the whole of Polish society and amounted to a rebellion against totalitarianism. ‘Without the use of force’ is a principle worth adhering to in today’s world too. It was a movement inspired by values. We are proud that the word solidarity has become part of the language of politics. It is a very significant word for us, a truly Polish word, and represents Poland’s contribution to the idea of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is my belief that the unification of Europe began at Gdansk, that East and West came together as a result of the movement started by the Gdansk shipyard workers, and that many other nations followed where Poland and Solidarity led. Solidarity inspired nations to be reborn and peoples to rise up for freedom. We feel proud of this, but above all we feel solidarity with those who brought freedom to Georgia through the Rose Revolution and to Ukraine through the Orange Revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this non-violent example of regime change by way of negotiation, allowing European ideals to become reality, will remain relevant to today’s world. I feel sure it is important for Europe that as the European Union seeks its own identity, it should wish today to chart the course taken by the people who worked for the freedom of Europe. They were the men and women who ended the Cold War and made the unification of Europe possible.</p>

I am glad that the Commission has had something to say about the Solidarity movement today. One might think there were occasions of greater contemporary relevance and that the celebrations over the past weeks had paid sufficient tribute to history, but our debate today shows that the opposite is the case. When I joined in the celebrations in Warsaw and Gdansk three weeks ago, it was again brought home to me just how relevant to our own time this groundbreaking historic event actually is.</p>
<p class="contents">The legendary strike by Solidarity that we are commemorating is part of our living heritage, and has lost none of its significance in 25 years. It was the politically and socially oppressed and disadvantaged who, by their courage, succeeded in bringing to an end the totalitarian Communist regimes in Poland and, following on from that, in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe; their boundless desire for reform is on all our lips. Above all, though, we revere the memory of the victims of these totalitarian regimes, remembering those who were oppressed, arrested, shot dead during protest strikes, condemned and executed after show trials. One man – the priest, Father Jerzy Popiełuszko, can be taken as representative of all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The years 1953, 1956, and 1968 are significant in the histories of East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but Solidarity gave impetus and reinforcement to the civil rights movements in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Charta 77, which campaigned for traditional, political human rights, the ‘Swords into Ploughshares’ peace campaign in the former East Germany, and the ‘Dunakör’ environmentalist movement in Hungary. What all this adds up to is that, without Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would not have fallen.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak for this House when I say that debate mattered to those who supported the Solidarity movement in Poland – debate that involved our friends Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuroń, as well as Bronisław Geremek and Janusz Onyskiewicz, who are now Members of this House, and so we are very grateful to them for the way in which they, 25 years ago, laid the foundation stones of a Europe united in peace, freedom and democracy, a Europe guided by social and environmental principles.</p>

We were a group of young Swedes cooperating with Poland’s independent movement of students and pupils. It was a youth movement that, in practice, was a part of Solidarity and of the huge and positive mobilisation that Solidarity stood for in the Polish society of the time. For me, the visit was a real eye-opener. The freedoms and rights that I, as a Swedish teenager, took for granted were things for which my Polish contemporaries had to fight hard. Poland was a society with a shortage of goods and manifest political oppression and, for most Poles, life was hard. With its demands for freedom, democracy and the right to national self-determination, Solidarity then stood for the hope of a better future. It was a progressive movement, and not only because it called for the democratisation of Polish society. As a union, it campaigned for higher wages, better pension conditions, influence in the work place for employees and better health care and child care. It was a genuinely progressive movement that was put down when, with the support of the Soviet Union, the military assumed power. In spite of military rule, there was no crushing the demands and hopes symbolised by Solidarity, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, on a number of occasions, spontaneous organisation on the part of workers, together with demands for independent trade unions, have been decisive in opposing the dictatorships in those countries dominated by the Soviet Union following the war. Solidarity and the Polish opposition constituted one – and perhaps the most important – of the succession of revolts against oppression. East Berlin in 1953, Budapest in 1956, Pozna in the same year and Prague in 1968 were cases in which the democratic opposition was put down using violence. More often than not, it was workers – organised as they were and with their demands for justice and democracy – who were in the front rank of the protesters.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Poland is a political democracy among other political democracies. Huge progress has been made in crucial areas since the fall of the Berlin Wall. An important factor behind this – indeed, perhaps the absolutely crucial factor – was Solidarity’s efforts in opposing the old regime. This development has led to a better future, not only for Poland but for the whole of Europe. At the same time, a lot remains to be done, considering the social demands made by Solidarity in terms of worker influence and a better standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is at present a society in which many people are badly off and in which there is very high unemployment. At the same time, very few people are organised in trade unions, and employees often struggle to make their voices heard. If something is to be done about this, a strong, well-organised trade union movement is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also an opportunity to recall a fundamental truth about the activities of people and nations, and about the moral and political foundations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The slogan that inspired millions of members of this trade union in 1980 and 1981 and also during the period of martial law was ‘There can be no freedom without Solidarity’. We were fully aware that it was upon solidarity between human beings that Solidarity with a capital S was based. That was what ensured its success and indeed its survival. It is also true that Western politicians and societies took this slogan to heart as they supported the people of Poland in their struggle for national sovereignty and democracy. This slogan therefore recalls the actions ‘Let Poland be Poland’ and ‘Solidarity with Solidarity’, and also the material aid that the union, its activists and many millions of ordinary Poles received from citizens of countries in the West.</p>
<p class="contents">You must believe me, ladies and gentlemen, when I say that the political, moral and material solidarity shown to us by people in the West helped to keep our hopes alive and made us feel that our efforts were not hopeless and that we were not alone. I experienced this myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like today to take the opportunity of having the floor in the European Parliament to offer sincere thanks to all those people of good will who expressed solidarity with us. In their wider meaning, the lessons of solidarity, with and without a capital S, remain valid today. ‘There can be no freedom without Solidarity’ also means that freedom is not an end in itself. In its economic sense, freedom is essential, but if it is bereft of solidarity it results in the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer and affects individual economies across the whole European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom can easily turn into anarchy or a new kind of oppression if it lacks a moral dimension. Freedom without solidarity amounts to self-will. Sooner or later it harms the individual or the community. It breaks up families and societies. Those who attempt to install freedom without solidarity and without fundamental rights such as the right to life, justice and honesty are disregarding the rights of others and undermining the community. Ultimately, they are endangering freedom itself.</p>

This peaceful non-violent movement proved as effective as the movement led by the great Mahatma Ghandi a few decades earlier had been. Ghandi’s movement eventually led to Indian independence, whilst Solidarity was instrumental in Poland regaining its sovereignty and Poles their freedom. Solidarity was instrumental in much more besides. It led to the peaceful revolution in Central and Eastern Europe. Nine years after the so-called outbreak of Solidarity, Czechoslovakia underwent the Velvet Revolution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall followed. The origins of these events can, however, be traced back to 1980 and to Gdansk, in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity was not just a trade union with 10 million members, representing almost 40% of the adult population of my country. It was also a movement working for democratic freedoms, free elections, free media and freedom of religion. I cannot be impartial, as I am a Pole, but even so, I firmly believe that Solidarity was a crucial turning point in our common European 20th century history.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, 25 years later, I should like to pay tribute to Solidarity as a Pole and as a European. It was largely due to this movement that my country and neighbouring nations gained their freedom. Our freedom is not all it could be. We still have many economic and social problems to deal with, but the most important thing is that we do now enjoy real freedom and are in a position to put our own house in order. I should like to thank the many millions of ordinary working people in my homeland whose efforts enabled us to be in this fortunate position. Poland and the whole of Europe owe you a debt of gratitude. We are all indebted to Solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this occasion I cannot ignore the memory of how deeply the phenomenon of Solidarity strengthened the hopes of democrats in Slovenia, and the significance for us at that time of the words of John Paul II, when he said ‘Do not be afraid.’</p>
<p class="contents">As we express our recognition of Solidarity and remember with special reverence those who paid for the desire for freedom and democracy with their lives, we are aware that Solidarity is no museum piece, but an inspiration, a concept, and a much needed way forward, without which European and global development is unimaginable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are erecting a monument to Solidarity, but not archiving it, for we wish to develop it further. There is an obvious need for solidarity between generations, between social partners, between more developed countries and less developed countries in the areas of security, disaster relief and so on. I firmly believe that the quality of our lives in the future will depend on the fulfilment of this essential principle. I think that following the historic breakthrough we need another period of Solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that today is the right time for people who have not lived under the yoke of Communism to pay their respects to those who, particularly in Poland, rose against a regime that we all considered reprehensible. It was a very special chapter in Poland’s history and I am delighted that we are commemorating it today in this Parliament, in Strasbourg. Although it forms an important part of Polish history, it is not for the Poles alone, for the example of <span class="italic">Solidarność </span>– Solidarity – has led to much discussion and movement and has had an enormous impact outside Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that, even after 25 years, Solidarity is a household word in my country, the Netherlands, too. What was so special was that the workers at a Gdansk shipyard staged a protest, went on strike, but also enjoyed the support of a group of prominent intellectuals who were prepared to stick their necks out and oppose the regime in Poland. I think that it was, in fact, an example of the best the labour movement as we have known it in Europe had to offer, the democratic labour movement that, in terms of freedom, political awareness and emancipation, has also had great significance in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also, I think, been a source of inspiration to many, not only in Eastern European countries, but also in Western Europe, and people, not least in the Netherlands, have also often been surprised at the moral fibre of the strikers in Gdansk who stood up to the Communist regime in this fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the work of Solidarity also meant the beginning of the end of a fantastic revolution in Poland’s history; we can now say that Poland has at long last found its rightful place, free in Europe. That is also the Poland that, to my mind, should be the centre of attention. The Polish struggle for freedom, and its history, enrich our continent; the story of the Polish plumber become even more poignant in the light of this historic role.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Solidarity lives on in Poland and in the hearts of the Polish people, as is evident once again today, it also deserves to be remembered as a shining, European example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They were aware that, in a society in which one group oppresses the other, nobody – not even the oppressors – can be really free. This belief would certainly have led those old Socialists, including their great thinker Karl Marx, to applaud the Polish workers’ protest in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century. Any authoritarian regime that skimps on wages and benefits while favouring a small group of people deserves to go under as a result of mass protest.</p>
<p class="contents">Normally speaking, workers’ protests are directed at big business’ desire for profit or at a government that considers itself to be right-wing. That was certainly not the case in Poland, where the state was founded upon Socialism, the intellectual legacy of Marx, common ownership of the means of production and the equality of all people. That state was not the product of the working class struggle, but of the way in which, after the Second World War, the victors shared out the military spheres of influence .</p>
<p class="contents">The people experienced the reality of that moment as the complete opposite of what Socialists claim to pursue. That is one of the reasons that in the mid-80s, I was a speaker at a meeting in the Netherlands for solidarity with the suppressed independent trade union in Poland. I have never shared the opinion that workers should be content with their leaders when these call themselves Socialists or Communists.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, people holding strongly differing opinions talk about Solidarity’s legacy, both inside and outside Poland. To one group, it represented the return to the Conservative Poland of the Pilsudski period between the wars; to the other, it was a necessary step towards the replacement of the caricature of Socialism conceived after 1945 by a real, Socialist democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The former opinion appears, for the time being, to have the upper hand; while not deploring this outcome, I do consider the resistance to unacceptable rule an inherent right of all people, and Solidarity an inspiring example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Had it not been for Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would have fallen later, or might even still be standing. Attempts had been made previously by the Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians to overthrow that diabolical system, but it was the Poles and the Polish Pope who eventually succeeded in dismantling the agreements reached at Yalta. I should today like to thank the countries of Western Europe and the United States for their support. It should be remembered, however, that Stalin was not the only guilty party. Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed half of Europe to the Soviets at Yalta, hoping for peace and quiet and to make things easier for themselves.</p>

I congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski and the Civic Platform, as well as the Law and Justice Party, on their victory in yesterday's general election, and I am sure Poland has a great future under new leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Lech Wałęsa is the most prominent personification of Solidarity and its success. He was in Brussels recently to receive the acclaim of this House on its important anniversary. He has won many honours from countries and organisations around the world in recognition of his courage and vision, perhaps the greatest honour being his election as Poland's President after Communism crumbled.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain has always felt a special affinity with Poland, and this was evidenced in the early 1980s when Poland was going through very difficult times. It was a British Conservative Minister for Foreign Affairs, Malcolm Rifkind, who went to Warsaw and became the first western politician to meet with representatives of Solidarity, an act that infuriated the Communist regime. This meeting was symbolic of the deep bond between Britain and Poland. All through those grim years we in Britain never forgot Poland, nor did we ever lose our conviction that democracy and freedom would ultimately prevail and that Poland would once again take its honoured place in the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to forget the speed with which Europe has moved on from those dark days and what life was like for those under the yoke of Communist tyranny. That is why it is so important that we never forget, and with Poland rightly taking its place in the European Union last year we can be sure that those who suffered and those who inflicted the suffering will not be forgotten. Solidarity symbolised then, as it does now, hope in the future, the determination of people to build better lives for themselves and their families and an unshakeable belief in the power of the human spirit. Political systems can subjugate wills and extinguish individuality but they can never quench the desire to be free. We would all do well to learn the lessons that Solidarity's history teaches us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, now that the shipyards have been privatised, two thirds of the workforce was dismissed in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Walesa and Solidarity, of course, did not go on any strikes because it was they who dismissed them. In the town of Gdansk, which you have as a symbol, poverty reigns. Unemployment exceeds 15%. In ‘free’ Poland, working farmers, the grass roots, live in drastic conditions. The standard of living is plummeting. Fourteen years after the overthrow of socialism, the Poles are consuming less, including less basic foods, than in 1980. All social achievements have been eroded. Foreign capital is plundering the country. Farmers are being wiped out and new latifundia are being created.</p>
<p class="contents">The course of events demonstrates, therefore, that Solidarity was the Trojan Horse for the restoration of capitalism in Poland. The leaders deceived the workers. They projected pro-labour demands, trapped them and brought them to this pass. They had economic and political support from the United States and governments in other capitalistic countries, which are today reaping huge profits for capital and creating poverty among the Polish people.</p>
<p class="contents">For the benefit of the previous speakers, Walesa's slogans of alleged freedom and solidarity for the workers, led them – impoverished, subjugated and disenfranchised – into the hands of the capitalists.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as democracy in Poland is concerned, let me quote you just one statistic: 20% voted in the last European elections. That is what they think about the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are few events one wishes to refer to with pride and pleasure, particularly in this House. In my view, solidarity is a concept that deserves a special entry in all encyclopaedias. It is not easy to show solidarity. It is often necessary to sacrifice one’s own interests, national interests and possibly higher ones too. The European Union is not a cohesive unit like a nation, an ethnic group, or maybe a political one. That is why an effort of solidarity is needed. It was only thanks to the determination and solidarity of workers, students, farmers, academics and sometimes of police and army officers that refused to be intimidated, along with the solidarity shown by people from abroad, that it was possible to force the dinosaurs clinging on to power to surrender it. That enabled ordinary decent people to reinstate respectable values.</p>
<p class="contents">If we find it within us to recognise the meaning of the Solidarity movement, and to learn this historic lesson, we shall be in a position to hope that the measures voted through in this House will be implemented. We shall also be in a position to hope that the coordinated body known as the Union will gradually come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is too complex and diverse for this aim to be achieved without solidarity. Solidarity must be promoted in this House, in the Commission, and through educational and cultural programmes. It needs to be grafted onto all Europeans. At the same time, we should be developing a broader solidarity that could be termed supra-continental, in order to help deal with the problems facing mankind. Allow me to emphasise that without solidarity there can be no future for Europe or for mankind as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In its 1980 version, solidarity began in Świdnik and Lublin, and it made it possible for us to be able to discuss fundamental values in this House today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for contemporary European solidarity to ensure that at the end of the next 25 years, Members will be able to speak in similar terms about today’s Parliament and Commission, and credit them with playing a leading role in the historical process we are all involved in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We remember the days and months when the Polish people could take no more and when Polish workers went on strike in Gdansk. We remember the fight that set in motion so much more than simply the struggle for Polish freedom. What it set in motion was the fight for the freedom of the whole of Eastern Europe. The first stone to fall from the Berlin Wall fell not in Berlin but in Gdansk. We often forget, however, that the strike and the solidarity in Gdansk were preceded by years of Polish revolt against Communism. Many fought for freedom, doing so each independently and in different ways, but there was no combined force uniting all Poles around the same idea. Only when a Polish pope was installed in the Vatican did the Poles realise that they were united by their spiritual inheritance and that there were forces that would take them forward to independence and autonomy. And so it came to pass.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself was living at that time in Communist Yugoslavia and clearly remember the pictures from Gdansk. I could not understand how anyone could actually believe it was possible to topple Communism. When, almost two decades after Gdansk, the people of Serbia protested against Milosevic’s regime, they had learned something from Solidarity. They had learned that totalitarian regimes do not go on forever, but can in actual fact come tumbling down. They had also learned that democracy must always come about from within and that victory necessarily falls to a unified people fighting for its freedom. The most important message for Europe had already been sent by Solidarity. My fellow Member, Mr Sjöstedt from Sweden, who belongs to a party whose leader still calls himself a Communist, has just made a speech in which he paid tribute to Solidarity, a movement that fought specifically against Communism. This too is a message sent by Solidarity to Europe: that Europe does not tolerate either Communist, or any other, dictatorships or, indeed, any systems of totalitarianism or enslavement. The future of Europe lies in freedom, and that is something we all defend, and today most especially by expressing our respect for, and gratitude towards, the people of Poland and Eastern Europe who fought for a free Europe during the 1980s and 90s. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bogusław Sonik (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, Solidarity was an extraordinary experiment involving a community that developed on the basis of common values and confidence in freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">In August 1980 Polish workers demanded freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief and above all freedom to set up free trade unions and an end to persecution for reasons of conviction. Millions of Poles said ‘no’ to Communism, and this was the beginning of the end of the Communist dictatorship. We called on the nations of Eastern Europe to engage in the struggle for civil liberties, which involved building a civil society. We did so with determination and strong in the belief that freedom can be won in spite of all overtly political restrictions. Millions of individuals committed themselves in solidarity to the life of their own country, a country that was free for 16 months until 13 December, when General Jaruzelski’s Communist dictatorship struck against this movement with a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. It was impossible to stifle or break our spirit, however, and we continued to live as free people. Communism was mortally wounded at the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, and received its <span class="italic">coup de grâce</span> nine years later in 1989.</p>
<p class="contents">We were helped in our struggle by other European nations. France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom all supported us. This gave us courage and a belief in our own strength, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who stood by us at that time. It was thanks to you that we survived, strong in the knowledge that Europe was thinking of us and that we had not been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent can the ideals of solidarity move hearts and consciences today? Nowadays, reflecting about Solidarity means reflecting about the nature of Europe. Europe is more than an economy and a market. It also stands for the values that make the European Community great. Europe is a family of nations built on a Christian heritage. Solidarity was founded on Christian principles and it strove to reawaken the best of human values in people. I refer to taking responsibility for each other, and being prepared to help those in need. The Solidarity ethic could contribute to the creation of a contemporary vision of Europe that would awaken the interest of the world. Reflecting about Solidarity nowadays also means reflecting about how to counter national egoism amongst the 25 Member States of the Union. I am confident that this can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in a European Union imbued with solidarity, a Union that is capable of being competitive, but which is simultaneously capable of demonstrating solidarity with the small and the weak. I believe in a Union that will hold high the banner of Solidarity and freedom, and be an inspiration to those who lack them.</p>

Solidarność started the process of East European nations becoming genuinely free from totalitarian enslavement. The other lung of the same European homeland, to quote Pope John Paul II, started to breathe and to bring oxygen and self-respect to tens of millions of Eastern Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is a symbol for Europe. It was the first victim of the alliance of Hitler and Stalin, who together launched the Second World War. The Polish nation experienced the worst of both of these dictatorships. It is not by chance perhaps that the victory of the Gdansk workers opened the way for the reunification of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the most significant achievement of Solidarność was its ability to unite all sectors of society. It was not possible without a moral revival, without the spiritual dimension of which a Polish pope became the embodiment, reminder and inspiration. The important message of Solidarność's victory remains how to find both strength and balance in the passionate quest for justice and the eternal spiritual values of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to this message would probably help us to overcome the crisis of European identity, of which there was talk today, because Solidarność has become part of our European identity. We have an opportunity to decide on celebrating 31 August as a day of freedom and solidarity, but another date of European significance needs to be remembered. On 23 August, the date on which the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed in 1939, we should commemorate the victims of both communism and Nazism. Only then will the famous slogan, 'Never again', also apply to the victims of communism.</p>

Solidarity, together with its values and ethos, should become part of the heritage of the whole of Europe and indeed of the whole of the world. That is precisely why it is important for Solidarity to become a permanent feature of our European consciousness. As stated in our resolutions, 25 years ago the workers of Gdańsk opened a new chapter in the European struggle for bread and freedom. It was the workers of Poznań, where I come from, who actually launched the struggle 49 years ago. On 28 June 1956 several dozen of them died at the hands of Communists. They died because they demanded bread and freedom. Fortunately neither their deaths, nor the deaths of the workers who died in December 1970, were in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity has global significance because it was a peaceful movement but also a victorious one. Solidarity's story inspires optimism and confidence, as it proved that even a Communist totalitarian regime could be brought down without the use of force. It would be wonderful if Solidarity's methods and values became an effective way in which all people living under oppressive regimes could fight for freedom, dignity and human rights. Solidarity demonstrated that it makes sense to hope for a better life, and that perseverance and belief in one's principles will bear fruit. I am convinced that the European Union of 25 Member States would not exist today if Lech Wałęsa and his companions had not acted as they did 25 years ago.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
