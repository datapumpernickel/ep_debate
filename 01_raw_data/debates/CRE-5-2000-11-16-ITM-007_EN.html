We have done so out of respect and in order to assist the consolidation of democracy in that part of the world, to support and assist social and economic development and also to ensure that human rights are respected there as elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the priorities that we have supported for the countries in that region is regional integration. We feel that regional integration is a crucial instrument for promoting the three fundamental objectives that I have just mentioned. In Central America, there is already a Secretariat for Regional Integration, a Central American Bank, a Central American Upper House and a Central American Parliament. Curiously, this and the European Parliament are the only Parliaments in the world to directly elect their members. The Central American parliament appears to have recently been the subject of certain misunderstandings and even criticism. We received a delegation from that parliament and made a commitment to improving the political profile not only of its role in that part of the world but also of relations between our Parliament and the Central American Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the motion for a resolution that we are tabling following a project that was started a while ago by Parliament’s delegation to Central America, chaired by Mr Salafranca, and which we have modestly continued with during our term of office. This resolution, therefore, means giving political support to the Central American Parliament, to the democratic stage <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, which must strive to be the focus of pluralist debate in that part of the world, and, at the same time, it means sending the message that Europe is in favour of regional integration in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one aspect that we are unhappy with, which is not a problem of substance, but concerns item 5 of this resolution: we feel that, by adopting this item, the European Parliament has adopted an excessively paternalistic attitude. We shall abstain from voting on item No 5, but our aim is to provide political support to the Central American Parliament and regional integration there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is timely for three important reasons that affect this special American region, not to mention the importance and political appropriateness of strengthening the dialogue between the European Parliament and the Central American Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it promotes the process of the consolidation of democracy and the deepening of the demand for human rights to be respected, particularly in relation to indigenous populations. Secondly, because it coincides with the tenth Latin American Summit, which will take place shortly in Panama, and which will deal with commitments to children and young people on the basis of justice and equality in the new millennium. Thirdly, because it also coincides with the current philosophy of the European Commission in favour of redirecting Union external action towards the countries of Latin America with the potential impact that this may have. In this regard, we hope and trust that the necessary amounts will be allocated to provide impetus for the process of regional integration in Central America, where dialogue is becoming necessary and essential as a permanent political exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased with this political declaration by our Parliament in relation to the Central American Parliament, because it recognises the role that this institution plays in the process of integrating the countries of this area, situated between the north and south of America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I remember very well that throughout these years this delegation has maintained extraordinary relations with Parlacen and with the other Latin American parliaments. This is perhaps because Parlacen and the European Parliament represent their citizens in a similar way. In both cases we are directly elected.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember very well that Mr Salafranca signed a document with the President of Parlacen on political dialogue between the two parliaments. At that time I believe that our political will was to enable Parlacen to have ever more competences and more economic resources and to play an effective role in the integration of the region it represents.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that four years ago – Mr Salafranca perhaps remembers this better – we held a meeting, called by IRELA, in Antigua, a beautiful city in Guatemala, where we debated along with our colleagues from Parlacen what the future should be, not only of Parlacen, but also of the European Parliament. We saw that Parlacen was going through the same changes that this Parliament went through at the beginning, since it had to fight and continues to fight to have more competences, more resources and more presence and to be recognised as representative.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is one of the central themes of the debates at every interparliamentary conference, along with the economic and social difficulties experienced by some of the countries of Central America and South America. Two fundamental objectives are to try to ensure that social differences are not made worse by the economic policies that currently prevail in that region and to try to ensure that the parliaments help with the integration of the area, which would be beneficial to all.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the purpose of this resolution. We believe that, not only now but since Parlacen was born, there are people who wish it to have fewer competences and less of a presence, because a parliament always creates discomfort, but I believe that the vocation of Parlacen, and of this and other parliaments, is to be of benefit to the people it represents, even if this may make the established powers feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope, Mr President, that this resolution will be approved by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express – as many previous speakers have done very effectively – this Parliament’s solidarity with, and support for, the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting to continue to prioritise the European Union’s external relations with the countries of Latin America. This is the approach of the report, an own-initiative report, which we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are going to produce in conjunction with the competent delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, parliaments – as you and all of us in Parliament know very well – have today, more than ever, the difficult task, amongst others, of showing leadership in the development of our societies, of leading the quest for solutions to the many problems facing us by strengthening the values of democracy and social justice which we stand for. In the case of the Central American Parliament, this task is, if possible, even more important given the enormous challenge of the integration and structural development of these societies on the basis of peace, dialogue and reconciliation. I believe that, on the basis of the 1997 Declaration, which Mrs González Álvarez referred to, we have achieved the objective of maintaining useful and realistic cooperation which we must continue, in my judgment, I would not say modestly, as Mr Seguro has said, but brilliantly, which is how he usually carries out the work in which he is involved. I believe that the European Parliament is capable of demonstrating, through its actions, that it has a very positive view of the work of Parlacen by offering it its support and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of our respective integration processes, it is clear that both the European Parliament and the Central American Parliament are required to play an increasingly important role. I believe that it is not our job as Members of the European Parliament to give advice to the Members of the Central American Parliament. The Central American Parliament will continue on its own course and will take a political path in a Central America which, I believe, wishes to and must regain possession of itself in a full union of diversity. On the basis of its shared roots, it must discover the broad range of its possible courses of development and the multiple possibilities that its project presents, by opting for peace, freedom and solidarity and also by responding to the age-old requirement of self knowledge. I therefore believe that we have to flatly reject the self-interested criticisms of those people who brand the activity of the Central American Parliament an artificial system and accuse it of being a cardboard parliament which is hollow and devoid of substance. The Central American Parliament, like the European Parliament, must gain prestige, credibility and legitimacy on the basis of the activity of its political groups, because the life of the parties is, or at least should be, a faithful reflection of the societies they represent. The aim should be to create strong parliaments which participate, act, debate and rebut, ratify and rectify, which energetically defend the values of freedom, which are the driving force of the region’s political development, and which also inform the people of the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, through this resolution we therefore wish to express our support for, and solidarity with, the Central American Parliament and also to ask the Commission to decisively support the multiannual programme which Parlacen has presented to the Commission, since we believe that, as an institution, it legitimises the process of integration in Central America and serves as a symbol of a new era of dialogue and peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is one of those questions on which we all feel practically the same, not only in this House but also amongst those many Members who, as result of our own origins, view with great sympathy the processes of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries which we consider to be our own.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the words of the honourable Member from the Canary Islands Coalition insofar as we show our support for Parlacen because of its importance in terms of the consolidation of democratic structures and, therefore, we, as the European Parliament, must stand united with an institution such as that.</p>

I believe that on these issues we have to continue to preach at home what we want to happen throughout the world, without averting our eyes when human rights are trampled underfoot in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the last part of Mr Salafranca’s intervention, I would also like to express my desire that the budgetary allocations should be at least sufficient for the work, which we consider to be important and which must be carried out in cooperation with Parlacen to be completed. In any event, I would like to express my conviction that we must ensure that actions take over from words. In relation to cooperation with Latin America, actions are the most effective possible yardstick, from our – that is, Spain’s – point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission follows the situation in the region with great interest and our priority objectives in our relations with the region focus on the three points which you have highlighted: respect for human rights, the consolidation of the democratic process and the strengthening of regional integration. In this context, the Commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to human rights, we have, since 1990, been supporting the cooperation programmes in favour of respect for human rights by means of education and raising awareness in this area. You are well aware that between 1990 and 2000 EUR 65 million has been spent on this activity, which we continue to support with a view to the future. For the next multiannual programme, which will begin soon, we are considering an additional contribution of more than EUR 10 million in order to continue this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Parlacen, I must point out that since its creation it has been treated as a privileged partner by the Commission for the programmes for strengthening the process of democratisation and regional integration. Within our framework of cooperation with the area, we have paid special attention to all those institutions which support regional integration, the general secretariat of the Central American Integration System, the Court of Justice and especially Parlacen, which is one of our priority objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission is currently studying the framework of that new strategy which Mr Salafranca referred to; let us hope that we can soon reach a conclusion that will allow us to release funds to support the Central American Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the dialogue with the Central American authorities, the Commission is also reiterating the importance which must be attached to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate democratisation and development in the region. On this issue, we are also working on the definition of a new cooperation programme which should allow us to concentrate on these three fundamental elements: economic integration – the implementation of common policies – the strengthening of the institutions and the strengthening of civil society. These points seem to us to be essential and should be the key elements of our multiannual programme between 2000 and 2006.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
