The Member States' conduct in the Iraq conflict has been the opposite; it has followed national interests and damaged the credibility of the EU's foreign policy and the CFSP. Unfortunately, the Presidency has contributed to the disunity by unilaterally adopting the Franco-German line.</p>
<p>It is the Presidency's responsibility to try to find compromises and common solutions to promote a united EU stance on various issues. The Danish Presidency showed great skill in this area. The disagreement over the Iraq conflict has not least been a factor in reducing confidence in the EU in the applicant countries.</p>

<p>(FR) The Presidency has made every effort to ensure the European Union speaks with one voice on the Iraq crisis. Like the honourable Member, it believes that the more united the EU is, the stronger it is, and the more it can make its voice heard in the international community. For this reason, the Council adopted significant conclusions on Iraq at its first meeting on 27 January. An initiative based on these conclusions was launched on 4 February in order to send a clear message to the Iraqi authorities. The 13 candidate countries supported this action. Subsequently, the Presidency took the lead and convened an Extraordinary European Council on 17 February. This resulted in a common declaration endorsed by the candidate countries the very next day. The declaration enshrined EU agreement on the key issues of the crisis:</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein should be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p>The United Nations should be at the centre of these efforts;</p>
<p>Inspections should be given a chance to work, but they should not continue indefinitely in the absence of Iraqi cooperation;</p>
<p>War is not inevitable. Force should be used only as a last resort;</p>
<p>The matter is now with the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Presidency will continue its efforts to achieve a common line in this and other matters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0096"></a>

<p>(EN) As for the declaration referred to in the question there is a rule for the Council not to comment on declarations by politicians. As far as the Council is concerned, it has no doubt as to the Iranian government's understanding of its competence and responsibilities in the field of human rights. Indeed, it is for precisely this reason that the Iranian government is engaging, not only in dialogue on human rights matters with the EU and with a number of other countries such as Australia, but also in co-operation with the UN and its various mechanisms in the field of human rights which monitor States' compliance with international human rights law. In any case, the Council is not aware of any elements in Foreign Minister Kharrazi's speech to the European Parliament, which might have given rise to this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The constructive nature of the EU's dialogue with Iran on human rights is not merely "so-called". The substance of the dialogue lies in discussing all of the issues which are of concern to the EU regarding the situation of human rights in Iran, and in exploring how the EU can assist or support progress towards improvement on all of those issues. In order to make the dialogue as constructive as possible, the EU has recognised from the outset that it must involve not only all the relevant branches of the Iranian government - the Judiciary as well as the Parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - but also Iranian civil society - academics, NGOs and the Islamic Human Rights Commission - in order to foster the internal debate for change within Iran at all levels. That is why the EU chose, for the first session of the EU-Iran human rights dialogue on 16 and 17 December 2002, to organise it in the form of a roundtable involving participants from all of the above sectors of Iranian government and society, followed by separate government talks involving the Iranian Judiciary, Parliament and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The liveliness and openness of the debate even within the Iranian delegation proved to the EU that its inclusive approach is the right one, and the EU intends to maintain this format for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The EU raised the issue of the death penalty with the Iranian government during its exploratory mission to Teheran in September/October 2002, as well as during the first session of the human rights dialogue in December and the Council notes that it has not received any corroborated evidence of any case of a person being stoned to death in Iran since the opening of the EU-Iran human rights dialogue in October last year. The EU will continue to press the Iranian government on this issue until the situation has improved, as the EU does with all other countries still imposing the death penalty with which it carries on political dialogue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0102"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to this question, I want to assure the honourable Member that the Council is strongly committed to further the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and also concerned about the consumption of energy.</p>
<p>In this respect I would like to make reference to the adoption of the most recent Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings (Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002). The basic objective underlying this Directive is to promote improvements of the energy performance of buildings within the EU. Energy efficiency in buildings is also promoted through the so-called SAVE Directive (93/76/EEC).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in its Conclusions of 30 May 2000 and of 5 December 2000, the Council endorsed the Commission's Action Plan on Energy Efficiency and requested specific measures in the building sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council has acknowledged the importance of energy efficiency in its conclusions of 10 October 2000 on common and co-ordinated policies and measures in the European Union to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, thus contributing to the objectives of the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP).</p>
<p>As to its own policy regarding its buildings, for several years now the Council's services have been taking steps to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>In the Council's buildings this essentially means energy saving by:</p>
<p>– automatic or remote switching-off of office lights;</p>
<p>– the replacement of old lighting by more efficient new equipment;</p>
<p>– improving heating and air conditioning equipment and control systems.</p>
<p>For a new building currently at the planning stage, which will feature the most economical energy consumption techniques, a co-generation (combined electricity and heat) plant is planned.</p>
<p>As regards transport, the Council has taken the following steps:</p>
<p>– it has recently published a call for tenders for the appointment of a consultant to assist the Council in establishing and implementing an in-house transport plan;</p>
<p>– in connection with this last point, the number of parking spaces in the Council's buildings has been cut by 10%, and the number of spaces for bicycles has been increased.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0894"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council is following discussions within the United Nations Security Council closely.

<p>In the meantime, the European Union believes humanitarian action must be taken now, without waiting for trust between the parties to be re-established. Consequently, in December last year the European Union once again reiterated to the parties that the Moroccan prisoners of war still in the Tindouf camp should be released as a matter of urgency.

<p>The Council of Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries of the EU met in Brussels from 16 to 19 December 2002. Three Spanish autonomous regions with legislative competence for agriculture and fisheries, Andalusia, Galicia and the Basque Country, had asked the Spanish Permanent Representation to the EU whether they might be allowed not actually to take part in the meeting, but simply to have access to the press room, where the media are informed directly about progress made in negotiations between the various government representatives. The Council is fully aware of the current importance of the decisions adopted at that meeting. However, the Spanish Government refused.</p>
<p>Can the Council presidency therefore say whether the national delegations included representatives of territorial sub-divisions, such as federal states, regional governments, constitutional regions, autonomous governments, etc. and, if so, which Member States were involved? Similarly, can it say whether there have been other occasions on which these regional representatives took part in any of the sectoral meetings of the EU Council of Ministers?

<p>As regards the person in charge of the New Peoples Army, Mr. Jose Maria Sison, the Council decision on 28 October 2002 to include him in the EU list was based on a detailed and in-depth examination of available information fully respecting the criteria laid down in Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001.</p>
<p>The Council would like to remind the honourable Members that bringing criminal charges against a person is not a pre-requisite to put that person on the list. Indeed, the criteria for the inclusion is strictly those laid down in Article 1(4) of the Common Position referred to above.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to clarify that Mr Sison has never been granted the status of political refugee within the meaning of Article 1A of the UN Convention on the Status of refugees. A request by Mr Sison to be granted that status in the Netherlands was rejected in Court on the grounds that there were serious reasons to suspect that Mr Sison had committed crimes in the Philippines as referred to in Article 1F of the Convention on Refugees. This decision has been upheld by all Courts of appeal in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, as far as the Council is informed, Mr Sison, though deprived of official status, has not been expelled to the Philippines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0901"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Union has constantly reaffirmed its position on Cyprus. The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the conclusions of the European Council which have regularly recalled the EU position. In particular, the Council underlines the conclusions of the European Council following its meeting in last December, in Copenhagen, which encourage Turkey to pursue energetically its reform process. As a matter of fact, if the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.</p>
<p>It is clear that the EU expects Turkey to co-operate constructively towards achieving a solution. Under the existing accession partnership, Turkey is required to support strongly the UN efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement. Last year, the UN have submitted a plan for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. This plan forms the basis of the current negotiations between the two Cypriot communities. The Council underlines that in Copenhagen it has been decided that as the accession negotiations have been completed with Cyprus, Cyprus will be admitted as a new Member State to the European Union and in paragraphs 10 to 12 of the Presidency conclusions, the Council has recalled its willingness to accommodate a settlement in line with the principles on which the EU is founded.</p>
<p>The new Turkish government has repeatedly stated that it supports the negotiation process on the basis of the UN plan, though substantial and constructive initiatives from the Turkish side remain to be seen. The EU is looking forward to a rapid agreement with the support of Turkey, hopefully in March, in accordance wit the new UN timelines and still in time to enable the signing of the accession treaty by a united Cyprus on 16 April 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0904"></a>

Within this framework it will emphasise the following aspects:</p>
<p>the development of the necessary mechanisms for the integration of the interests of tourism into Community policies and especially those related to:</p>
<p> transport;</p>
<p> protection of the consumer;</p>
<p> employment;</p>
<p>the relevance of European tourism to competitiveness and the development of the European economy;</p>
<p>the sustainable development of tourism following the drawing up and implementation of an "Agenda 21" for tourism.</p>
<p>In addition the Presidency recognises the need for:</p>
<p>a dialogue between the public sector and Europe's tourism industry, mainly within the framework of the annual European Forum;</p>
<p>the promotion of cooperation networks, especially in cases of inter-regional or cross-border cooperation with Community support;</p>
<p>strengthening the efforts to facilitate the access of people with special needs to tourist sites and activities, particularly in view of 2003 as the international year for the disabled.</p>

The Council held a policy debate on this subject, focussing its attention on key issues raised by the analysis with a view to enlighting possible elements for the EAP.

<p>The Council took note of the time-table envisaged by the Commission, starting with an in-depth consultation of Member States and stakeholders on the basis of its working document and a previous questionnaire, followed by information to the Council on the progress of ongoing work by mid-2003, and by proposals for appropriate measures before the end of 2003.</p>
<p>In light of the broad support expressed by delegations to the project of a future EAP, the Council under Greek Presidency will follow the work progress closely and will provide for expert input where required, while looking forward to the Commission report on the state of play to be presented by mid-2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0908"></a>

<p>(EN) The preparation for the 46<span class="sup">th</span> session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs has started in the competent Council bodies in Brussels and in Vienna but it is still at a preliminary stage.

<p>In the preparation for the statements of the Presidency at the regular session as well as at the ministerial segment, due account will be given to the orientations contained in the note on the mid-term evaluation of the European Union Action Plan on Drugs. This note reports a need for increased attention to the growing threat posed by production and consumption of synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>With regard to the ministerial segment of the 46<span class="sup">th</span> session of the UN Committee on Narcotic Drugs, the draft statement proposal includes specific points on the consumption and trafficking in synthetic drugs as well as on precursors.</p>
<p>As far as the regular session is concerned, specific steps taken within the framework of the Horizontal Working Party on drugs might lead to a joint E.U. position on synthetics, taking into account the draft recommendations by the Greek Presidency on "early intervention to prevent drug dependence, associated risks and criminality among young people using drugs". The recommendations are based on scientific evidence indicating that synthetic drugs use involves important risks for both physical and mental health. Special attention is given to young people at an early-stage of substance use-experimentation, occasional, recreational or circumstantial use.</p>
<p>The Greek Presidency intends to organise a special EU meeting on the profiling of precursors with the participation of experts (forensic scientists) from Member States which will be held in the margin of the Horizontal Drugs Group (probably in March).</p>

The Council therefore called on the Member States to instil a real culture of prevention by, inter alia, including basic occupational prevention principles in educational curricula and further training schemes.</p>
<p>In the same resolution, the Council further noted the need to promote the inclusion of health and safety at work in other Community policies and that, in that connection, it will be necessary to develop a co-ordinated approach with other policies pursuing protection objectives and based on preventive measures, especially, inter alia, education policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It has been reported in the Greek press that counterfeit euro notes (mainly in denominations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 euros) have been found in all kinds of enterprises - both large and small - throughout Greece, especially over the last five months. According to recent reports, there are even counterfeit 5 euro notes in circulation. In December 2002 alone two thousand counterfeit banknotes were seized, half the total number seized during the whole of last year. It should be borne in mind that Greek enterprises have been forced to obtain special counterfeit money detection pens and optical readers, thereby incurring additional costs. However, this method is not entirely reliable, since this equipment is 'fooled' by genuine, but very worn, banknotes; the person bearing the notes is then put to a lot of trouble without being in any way to blame. For in Greece whenever a counterfeit banknote is found, the bearer is immediately taken to the police station where the procedure for in flagrante crimes is initiated, even if he was unaware that he was using counterfeit notes.</p>
<p>What immediate measures does the Council intend to take, in cooperation with the European Central Bank, to provide a radical response to the phenomenon of counterfeit euro banknotes which come from counterfeiting workshops both within and outside the European Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) First of all it should be recalled that, in accordance with the competencies laid down in the Treaty, in particular in Art. 106 thereof and in Art. 16 of the Statute of the ESCB and the ECB, it is not for the Council but for the ECB to lay down the design features, which include the necessary anti-counterfeit features, of the banknotes issued by the ECB and the national central banks.</p>
<p>This being said, it should be underlined that, according to the recent report of the Commission on the practical experience gained with one year of circulation of Euro banknotes and coins (doc. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0747">COM(2002) 747</a> final), counterfeiting of Euro notes and coins has, since their introduction as from 1.1.2002, taken place at a much smaller scale than what was previously experienced with national banknotes and coins. According to the relevant statistics of the ECB, only 22.000 false Euro banknotes were discovered during the first six months of 2002 constituting only + 7 % of the total of false national notes discovered during the same period of 2001.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this number of 22.000 discovered false Euro notes (of which 65 % 50 Euro notes) has to be compared with the total number of 59 million Euro note in circulation.</p>
<p>As confirmed by the above Commission report, this seemingly satisfactory state of affairs is due to the sophisticated safety features, which protect the Euro notes, and coins against counterfeiting.</p>
<p>Thus the present anti-counterfeit features of Euro banknotes provided by the ECB seem to have proven themselves satisfactory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0022"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council has followed the Queen Boat case and is continuing to study it closely. It is paying particular attention to the retrial of the 50 or so people charged.</p>
<p>The European Union believes that the signature of the Association Agreement with Egypt has brought a new dimension to our relations with the country. This allows for dialogue on the subject of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Consequently, the heads of mission on the ground, as a troika, initiated a dialogue with the Egyptian authorities. They expressed their particular concern about cases relating to homosexuality. They emphasised that universal and internationally recognised values are at issue in such cases. The Egyptian side responded stating that homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt but that the arrests in the Queen Boat case had been made on the grounds of public prostitution and provocation, including use of the Internet.</p>

<p>(FR) The Council informs the author of the question that detailed examination is in course of the proposal submitted by the Commission on 6 May 2002 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 and amending Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 with regard to maintenance payments.</p>
<p>This proposal was submitted following the debate on the initiative submitted by France on 3 July 2000 aiming to abolish the exequatur for the party to a decision on parental responsibility covered by Regulation 1347/2000, concerning visiting rights, and in response to the Commission's initial proposal of 7 September 2001.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 28 and 29 November 2002, the Council reached an agreement on one of the most complex elements of the proposal, i.e. that relating to child abduction. The solution that met with consensus proposes, notably, arrangements for ascertaining whether the jurisdictions of the Member State in which a minor is habitually resident retain their competence in cases where a child has been illegally removed or has not been returned, and the conditions that should be verified in cases where a decision on non-return of a child has been made in the Member State in which the child is present after being illegally removed or not returned.</p>
<p>To this effect, it is proposed that there should be a specific procedure for cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, notably where a decision on non-return has been made by a jurisdiction of the Member State in which the child is present after being illegally removed or not returned.</p>
<p>In addition, reference to the 1980 Hague Convention is proposed for the procedures for returning a child who has been illegally removed or not returned. Also proposed are specific provisions for reinforcing the effectiveness of the Hague Convention at Community level.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed that a subsequent decision of a jurisdiction in the Member State of habitual residence of the child should be recognised and executed in another Member State without a prior requirement of a declaration recognising its executability and without any possibility of opposing recognition if the decision has been certified in the Member State where it was made.</p>
<p>The Council expects substantial progress to be made in 2003 with a view to the regulation being adopted this year.</p>
<p>The Greek Presidency has launched discussions in the relevant committee of the Council on the scope of the regulation and the definitions contained in it, as well as on cooperation between the competent authorities in the Member States. It believes that a political agreement on the proposal as a whole should be possible during its term of office.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0032"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council attaches the utmost importance to the respect, by the candidate countries, of human rights, including religious freedom. With regard to Romania, the Council notes that the Commission's 2002 Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession, which was issued in October 2002, has concluded that, in general, Romania continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria and has made progress since 1997 in consolidating and deepening the stability of its institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the protection of minorities. The findings of the Commission were endorsed by the Brussels European Council on 24/25 October 2002.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue raised by the Honourable Parliamentarian, the Regular Report states that freedom of religion in Romania is guaranteed by the Constitution and is observed in practice. There is however a particular issue concerning the property of churches. In this regard, the Report notes that " In July 2002, Parliament adopted legislation that clarified the process of restituting property confiscated from churches. The legislation extends the scope of the previous law in several important respects. However, only church property is covered and there is presently no legal framework for the restitution of actual churches. This is a particularly important issue for the Greek-Catholic Church which had a large number of properties confiscated by the Communist regime but still has no legal redress. The Government has committed itself to producing specific legislation on this issue but delays in preparing such a law means that there has been no substantial progress."</p>
<p>The Presidency would like to assure the Honourable Parliamentarian that the Union will continue to monitor the situation in Romania in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and, should the need arise, will discuss the matter with the Romanian side, in particular within the bodies established by the Europe Agreement such as the Association Council and Association Committee.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0041"></a>

<p>(EN) The decisions adopted by the European Council in Seville in June 2002 answered the need for the EU to adjust its decision-making structures in view of the forthcoming enlargement. The heads of State or government decided to reduce the number of Council formations and to integrate all matters relating to the Union's external actions within the new General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC). This decision aims at accommodating the objective of enhancing coherence between the components of the Union's external policies, while at the same time avoiding the risk of breaking up policy domains such as development co-operation.</p>
<p>The integration of development in this enlarged political forum should be considered as beneficial for development policy. By integrating development in this new structure the Council stresses the important role development plays as part of the EU external policy. The GAERC constitutes also an important effort to strengthen the EU's capacity to respond to development needs in a more coherent manner.</p>
<p>The Greek Presidency of the Council attaches great importance to fully implementing the Seville decisions, continuing what had already been done after Seville, i.e. to concentrate the agenda items on developmental co-operation at one or two sessions of the GAERC. It has planned an Orientation Debate to examine ways and means to further improve the efficiency of external actions of the EU. At the session of 19 and 20 May 2003, among others, development issues such as untying of aid as a way to enhance the effectiveness of aid, integrating migration issues into the EU's external relations with third countries and the participation of non-state actors in EC development policy, are planned for discussion.</p>
<p>The Presidency, which is responsible for the organisation of work of the Council, will take the necessary practical steps to allow Member States to decide in the best and more suitable conditions, upon the composition of their delegation including the possibility to invite Development Ministers to fully take part in these discussions for that purpose and as laid down in Article 3 of the Council's rules of procedure, the draft agendas of the sessions of the GAERC will be established by the Presidency at least 14 days before the meetings.</p>
<p>The priorities of the Presidency are well known in the European Parliament and in the Council in all aspects, including development policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0042"></a>

<p>With regard to the elements amended compared to the initial proposal, the honourable Member's attention is drawn in particular to the scope of products covered by the Regulation. In the proposal from 1988 it was foreseen to grant tariff suspension to products contained in an 8-digit CN code list.</p>
<p>This list was modified to a 4-digit CN code list and at the same time it was spelled out clearly by which national authority the goods would have to be imported and that they had to be used by or on behalf of the military forces of a Member State. All these modifications have been introduced in order to clarify to the maximum extent possible the scope of products and the conditions under which they would be covered by the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Euromed partnership has shown its resilience and has allowed its participants to engage into an open dialogue on all the issues of common interest. The Greek Presidency has indicated its intention to give special priority to the implementation of the Valencia Action Plan. This Plan was adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean conference of Foreign Ministers held in Valencia on 22-23 April 2002 which allowed for a renewed mutual commitment with the aim to give a greater depth to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. The Action Plan adopted by the Conference gave a political impetus to the process and aimed at contributing substantially to the pursuit of the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration reinforcing the sense of co-ownership of the partnership. In the area of the dialogue of cultures an Action Programme was adopted and the principle of the creation of an Euro-Mediterranean Foundation was agreed. Furthermore, the regional co-operation programme in the field of Justice, in combating drugs, organised crime and terrorism as well as co-operation in the treatment of issues relating to the social integration of migrants, migration and movement of persons adopted in Valencia, will be implemented during this year.</p>
<p>2. As regards financial assistance, the new Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), established within the EIB to promote infrastructure and private sector investment, was launched in Barcelona on 18 October 2002 and started its operations. The incorporation of an EIB majority-owned subsidiary dedicated to the Mediterranean partner countries will be considered one year after the launching of the Facility.</p>
<p>3. During the Greek Presidency a mid-term Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers that will be held in Crete on 26/27 May 2003 will be an opportunity to take stock of the progress made in the implementation of the Valencia Action Plan and to give fresh impetus to the work of the partnership in the run-up to the evaluation scheduled for the Naples Ministerial meeting in December 2003.This Conference will also be attended by the 8 acceding States which are not yet members of the Barcelona Process and will provide an opportunity for political discussions of how the Euro-Mediterranean partnership will be enhanced following enlargement. The 3rd Ministerial Energy Conference, which will be held on 20-21 May in Athens, will set out the framework for a new Euro-Mediterranean Action Plan on Energy. Furthermore, the Greek Presidency will facilitate the establishment of an Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p>4. On the bilateral level, relations of the Mediterranean partners with the EU have progressed significantly. During the Greek Presidency 2002, the interim Agreement between the Community and Lebanon will enter into force on 1st March. Two negotiating sessions with Syria will be held. An Association Council with Morocco was held on 24 February and a ministerial meeting with Egypt as well as a Troika meeting with Algeria are foreseen in June. These are important developments for the fulfilment of the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration as well as the reinforcement of the South-South co-operation in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>5. As regards enhancing opportunities for women in economic life, the relevant programme is included in the list of programmes to be launched in the 2002-2004 period under MEDA Regional Cooperation. Following information provided by Europe-Aid of the Commission, the regional programme which will focus on access and participation of women in the labour market as well as the promotion of the role of women in business, will be launched during 2004.The Commission has indicated that the necessary procedures for the choice of the consultants that will be in charge of the programme will be finalised during the first half 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0057"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council underlines that, already during the pre-accession period, in the context of the bodies set up by the Europe Agreements with the candidate countries, and on the basis of the provisions foreseen in these agreements, the issue of the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights has consistently been addressed with the candidates by the EU.</p>
<p>With EU membership, acceding countries are taking over all obligations stemming from the Treaties. As underlined by the European Council in Copenhagen, monitoring up to accession of the commitments undertaken will give further guidance to the acceding states in their efforts to assume responsibilities of membership and will give the necessary assurance to current Member States. The Council will continue to closely follow these issues, in particular on the basis of the monitoring reports the Commission will present.</p>
<p>If a new Member State failed to live up to its obligations, for instance in relation to combating counterfeiting, the infringement procedures foreseen in the Treaties would apply. In addition, in order to respond rapidly to unforeseen developments that may arise during the first years after accession, safeguard clauses have been enshrined in the Treaty and Act of Accession that provide for measures to deal with these developments in a rapid an efficient manner. Two specific safeguard clauses concern the operation of the internal market, including all sectoral policies that concern activities with a cross-border effect, and the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p>These safeguard clauses will permit the Union to adopt proportional measures for addressing cases where new Member States fail to implement their obligations, and are aimed at ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and the justice and home affairs area, which is in the interest of all Member States, current as well as new. Indeed, these are issues of particular concern to the citizens of the EU, as they cover areas such as food safety, safe medicinal products, or human trafficking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0060"></a>

<p>The coordinating committee of the movement for the disabled organised a protest march on Sunday, 26 January against the social policy of the Greek Government and the EU, demanding uniform, public, free and high-quality health and welfare provision, insurance for all, public support facilities for the severely disabled, jobs for the disabled capable of working, and public special educational facilities. The march was to have passed by the building in which the Greek Presidency was holding the official inauguration ceremony for the Year of the Disabled.

On the other hand the Council (as demonstrated by the agreements reached at the Council of Transport Ministers with the involvement of the Spanish Prime Minister, José María Aznar) has rejected such an approach, since it wishes EU legislation to continue to be determined by the IMO – a body which offers certain Member States with interests in the maritime sector a better base from which to protect the status quo, thereby allowing the oil companies and a ragbag of international transport groups and mafias to hold sway.

<p>(FR) The Council would remind the honourable Member that it has already had the opportunity of giving a full account of its position and intentions regarding the transport of hazardous material by sea and of assessing the present situation. This took place in the December plenary at Strasbourg and during the debate on topical issues.

The proposal was presented by the Commission on 27 December 2002 in response to the said Council conclusions.</p>
<p>The Council deems it important to have international measures responding to the international character of the shipping industry and with the aim of ensuring globally the highest possible levels of maritime safety and the protection of the environment. For this reason, the Council attaches great importance to the adoption also at international level, through the IMO, of rules reinforcing maritime security. With this objective, the Council conclusions in response to the Prestige accident also invited Member States and the Commission to make every effort to eliminate older single-hull vessels transporting heavy grades of oil through an amendment of the MARPOL Convention and expressed its support for the development in the IMO of a flag State code and a compulsory model audit scheme to ensure that flag States carry out their duties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0062"></a>

<p>(EN) The provisions of the Turkish constitution on political parties do not contain a reference to a ban of parties with the word "communist" in their name. The Council is not aware of a current ban or dissolution of a Turkish political party, or of such a threat, based on the word "communist" in the name of the party.</p>
<p>At the Copenhagen European Council, the EU strongly welcomed the important steps taken by Turkey towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria, in particular through the recent legislative reforms and subsequent implementation measures. It can among other be noted in this regard that the amended article 101 of the law on political parties makes it more difficult to close down a political party.</p>
<p>The EU continues to monitor closely the situation in Turkey in the field of freedom of opinion and of association. In the context of the accession process and of the political dialogue, it presses Turkey to make further progress towards guaranteeing full enjoyment of fundamental freedoms without any discrimination and irrespective in particular of political opinion or philosophical belief, as stipulated in the accession partnership.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0111"></a>

<p>Fishing for transparent goby is carried out in the sea off Livorno, at present by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) 1626/94<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The derogation is due to expire on 31 December 2003. Since official research carried out by the Italian Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry Policy indicates that this kind of activity has no adverse effect on the environment, does the Commission not consider that it should intervene and recognise this type of fishing as an authorised activity compatible with the Community legislation in question? In view of the latest guidelines on fisheries policy and since it has been ascertained that this kind of fishing and the fishing gear used - the ‘sciabichello’ (small trawl-net) - do not in any way jeopardise environmental protection and the conservation of a particular species, does the Commission not consider that it should declare this activity lawful, not least because the uncertainty and insecurity caused by the extension of a derogation already granted are damaging fishing in the Livorno area?

<p>(DE) The question relates to fishing for transparent goby, which is practised in many parts of the Mediterranean, using towed nets in shallow waters. The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries has examined the data provided by the national authorities, the Italian authorities among them, and published its conclusions in its twelfth report, which is before Parliament. According to these, fishing for transparent goby does not endanger other species of fish, but can damage sensitive seabeds.</p>
<p>The Commission will shortly be elaborating new rules for the use of such towed nets, and will be doing so on the basis of the scientific report and following consultation with interest groups, for which purpose it will be organising a workshop in mid-April, at which the necessary measures will be discussed with fishermen and scientists.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with regard to the decoupling of payments and modulation has been established on the basis of several internal analyses.</p>

<p>The modulation proposal and its impact on the agricultural sector has been analysed using the micro-economic models based on the Farm Accountancy Data Network of Directorate General Agriculture.</p>
<p>The results of these internal studies have been complemented by four external studies carried out by independent experts on the impact of the Mid-Term Review proposals from July 2002.</p>

<p>(FR)</p>
<p>1. The payment delays are due in part to the fact that Greece wishes some arrangements for compensating farmers to be financed from two sources, namely state aid and the so-called National Operational Programme – Rural Development (2000-2006) set up within the framework of the third Community Support Framework for Greece (CSF). They therefore have to be examined under two different sets of regulations.</p>
<p>With regard to state aid, substantial modification of the method of calculating losses used to determine the sums farmers are entitled to was required to deal with the Greek dossiers. This took some time, though it should be emphasised that all the dossiers were dealt with within the time limits laid down in Council Regulation (EC) n° 659/99<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Furthermore, for all the dossiers examined, the changes to the aforementioned method of calculation called for modification of the draft Greek interministerial decision constituting the legal basis for the compensation system. For each case, the Commission had to check the new versions of the interministerial decisions to ensure the changes agreed with the Greek authorities had been transcribed correctly. Following this check, the Greek authorities were authorised to make payments of approved national aid. The use of cofinanced funds was dealt with by a separate decision, as stated in paragraph 3 below.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the outstanding dossiers, the only system on which the Commission has yet to rule is the one on compensation for Greek farmers affected by the fires in the year 2000.</p>
<p>3. With regard to the use of funds from the National Operational Programme – Rural Development set up within the framework of the third CSF for Greece, the Greek authorities should have submitted information on an amendment to the programme. This involved so-called restructuring of the financial tables and should have been submitted prior to the payments being made. It must be emphasised that the programme is intended to support rural development in the country and that unlimited transfer of funds to compensation is likely to be detrimental to its other activities. At this stage, it is difficult to ascertain whether the payment of advances could have legal implications. This is because the Commission is not yet fully informed of the precise use to which the funds were put. It could have been reconstruction or compensation for loss of income. The Commission will only be in possession of this information once the restructuring referred to above has been completed and it has received the draft modification of the programme in question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Commission has received a letter from Minister Christodoulakis (Minister for Economy and Finance) addressed to the Member of the Commission in charge of Regional Policy, dated February 20<span class="sup">th</span> 2003, announcing the intention of the Greek Authorities to submit a request of assistance by the Solidarity Fund of the European Union ; the Commission has not received any information or request concerning the destruction of the agricultural production caused by the adverse weather conditions that took place there recently.</p>
<p>2. On the basis of the current regulatory framework, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that Community financial grants that might be necessary to overcome the specific problems of Greek rural areas can be taken from the total appropriations of the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> Community Support Framework (CSF) for Greece (2000-06), including its programming reserve. It should be emphasised that European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guidance intervention will be limited to the reconstruction of production potential and not to compensate income losses for which such assistance may be given by national funding under the prerequisite of the notification of such State Aids and the Commission approval.</p>
<p>Within this framework, it is up to Greece to submit to the Commission such requests based on objective parameters to support appropriate projects for the reconstruction of production potential and to ensure the quality of the construction works. This responsibility falls to the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>3. The CSF 2000-2006 for Greece provides that the Greek Authorities establish an appropriate scheme monitoring the quality of the studies and of the execution of the works. This scheme should also allow the Managing Authorities of the operational programmes to monitor the quality of the studies, and it foresees the establishment of technical assistance to help final beneficiaries to raise their design capacity.</p>
<p>ESPEL (The Hellenic Quality Control Organism) has also been established by the Greek authorities and has been monitoring the execution of construction projects to prevent low quality work and breaches of legislation since 1998.</p>
<p>In any case, it is up to the Greek Authorities to ensure that the construction of projects co-financed by the structural funds of the Community is of high quality and is done on the basis of adequate studies, including geotechnical studies for road works.</p>
<p>In the case of failure after extreme weather conditions, of roads or other projects co-financed by Community funds, it is on the basis of analyses to be carried out by the responsible Greek authorities, that the exact reasons of the failure can be defined.</p>
<p>The Commission will be in contact with the responsible Greek authorities, and will be informed on the results of these analyses, for follow-up purposes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0121"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for raising this question which relates to the proposal contained in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform package to introduce a new measure for promotion of quality food products within the current ‘menu’ of measures eligible for support under the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> Pillar. Linked to the introduction of this new measure the Commission is proposing to repeal from 1 January 2005 Regulation 2826/2000 on information and promotion actions for agricultural products on the internal market<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed the repeal of this regulation to avoid any scope for overlap or duplication between the two instruments. The Commission also considers it is appropriate and coherent to focus its promotion support on the internal market on quality products as indicated in the proposal amending Regulation 1257/1999<a href="#defann_42_3" name="refann_42_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, given that increasing the focus on food quality in order to better respond to consumer requirement is an underlying theme of the CAP reform proposals overall.</p>
<p>While it is correct that the scope and beneficiaries of the two instruments indeed cannot be identical, the Member of the Commission in charge of Agriculture does not agree with the honourable Member that there is no scope for duplication between them. Promotion activities concerning Community schemes for protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, guaranteed traditional specialities and quality wines could, for example, potentially be eligible under either of the two instruments.</p>
<p>The proposed repeal of Regulation 2826/2000 has already been the subject of discussion with Member States in the Council Working Group, with several expressing reservations notably because, as the honourable Member correctly indicates, following the outcome of the Brussels Summit no additional financing will be available for the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> Pillar until 2007.</p>
<p>Under the Commission proposal generic promotion will not be discarded, but will henceforth be concentrated on activities in third countries’ markets where Community is facing strong competition from other exporters in all quality categories. Inter-professional organisations will continue to be able to benefit from these measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) Under the terms of the habitats directive the Member States are required to take suitable measures to prevent by-catches of dolphins.</p>
<p>The Commission has therefore decided to tackle the problem of by-catches of dolphins in the context of the common fisheries policy. It is working on a proposal for a regulation laying down measures to monitor and prevent by-catches of maritime mammals.</p>
<p>With that aim in view, the Commission has obtained an expert report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and consulted the Scientific and Technical Fisheries Committee and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture.</p>
<p>On the basis of that document and those talks, the Commission will put forward the following proposals:</p>
<p>restrictions will be imposed on the length of driftnets used in the Baltic Sea;</p>
<p>fishermen will be required to use acoustic equipment in conjunction with certain gillnets;</p>
<p>trawlers will be required to carry observers in certain fishing areas where the risk of by-catches is high.</p>
<p>The Commission will complete the drafting of this proposal at the latest within the next three months.</p>
<p>The Commission also endorses the views of those scientists calling for a long-term strategy to combat by-catches. To that end, we must lay down limit values for by-catches of maritime mammals and take specially tailored measures as soon as those limit values are exceeded. However, important data fundamental to such a strategy are lacking at present.</p>
<p>That information will be collected with the help of the observers referred to above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0123"></a>

<p>(EN) Organic farming is a rapidly growing sector. Indeed, in many Member States, it is one of the farming sectors that, in sharp contrast with many other sectors, continues to expand. The existence of a legislative Community framework in this field<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has no doubt contributed to this development.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sector is, as the honourable Member rightly observed, in absolute figures still relatively small. While an average of 2 % of the farmers in the Community use organic farming methods, the acreage they cultivate covers more than 3 % of the agricultural surface. But there are large differences between Member States. In Austria 9 % of the farmers and over 11 % of the acreage is dedicated to organic farming. In Finland, these figures have expanded beyond 5 and 7 %. Finally, in Greece and Ireland, less than 1 % of the farmers or the land is engaged in organic farming. So, there is still a lot to do, and more and better training will certainly be a key factor in the further development of the organic farming sector. This has been recognised in the Commission working paper on the possibility of a European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. This document has been debated in the Council in December 2002, and has now been published on the Commission website for consultation of civil society at large. On the basis of the information received through the online consultation, and following discussion with Member States and other stakeholders, the Commission will develop the proposals for its final European Action Plan.</p>
<p>It is possible already now for Member States to support advisory services for organic farmers and for those conventional farmers who are considering converting to organic farming. Co-financing for these types of measures is already available under Rural Development<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To conclude it should be underlined that, from the experience gained, it is clear that a successful development of organic farming depends on many factors. Training is an important element, but so are many others, all of which need to be addressed simultaneously to obtain the maximal synergy between the different efforts spent in separate areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Introduction</p>
<p>Article 27, paragraph 1 of Staff Regulation states that "recruitment shall be directed to securing for the institution the services of officials of the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity, recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis from among nationals of Member States of the Communities". Paragraph 3 of the same Article limits the Commission’s discretionary power to the extent that "no posts shall be reserved for nationals of any specific Member State".</p>
<p>Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden in 1995</p>
<p>As in previous enlargements, a time-limited derogation from the provisions of Article 27 was agreed by means of Council Regulation (EC) No 626/95 of 20 March 1995 which allowed the recruitment of nationals from Austria, Finland and Sweden through special and temporary measures until 31 December 1999.</p>
<p>In order to provide a fair and balanced representation of the new Member States in the Commission staff, the Commission Communication<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 19 July 1994 set recruitment targets for the three new Member States. For Sweden, 400-500 posts for non-linguistic staff and 157 posts for linguistic staff (551-657 in total) were earmarked.</p>
<p>During the derogation period (1995-1999) special competitions reserved for the accession countries were organised.</p>
<p>Current situation</p>
<p>The Commission does not have “25,000” officials. Out of 21.125 Commission officials (including research staff and officials on leave on personal grounds), 630 are Swedish. Staff from Sweden represent 2.9 % of the total number of officials in the Commission and 3.5% of the total A grade staff of the Commission. (As the honourable Member will know, the population of Sweden is 2.36% of the total Union population). This does not objectively represent an unfavourable “imbalance”.</p>
<p>There are 18,343 officials in active employment within the meaning of Article 35a or seconded to the office of a Commissioner (Art 37a) as at 1 January 2003, of whom 514 are Swedish officials.</p>
<p>There were 567 officials on personal leave within the meaning of Art 35c as at 1 January 2003, of whom 68 are Swedish officials.</p>
<p>There were 141 officials on secondment (Art 37) as at 1 January 2003, of whom 5 are Swedish officials.</p>
<p>At senior management level there is 1 Director General (A1 grade) and 6 A2 grade officials of Swedish nationality, one of whom is a Principal Advisor. At middle management level (A3/LA3 grades) there are 20 officials, 5 of whom are Advisors of Swedish nationality. There are 14 other middle managers at A4/LA4 level of Swedish nationality.</p>
<p>The Commission monitors the overall geographical balance continually and the subject is periodically addressed at various levels during bilateral talks between representatives of Member State governments – including Sweden - and the Commission.</p>
<p>Whilst, in compliance with the Staff Regulations, the Commission strives to ensure the maintenance of merit and geographical balance in its staffing, the Institution does not have and would not seek the power to inhibit the freedom of officials to leave the Commission if that is their personal desire. It is also relevant to recognise that, like all of the Institutions, the Commission’s ability to recruit and retain staff from across the Member States depends very largely on the willingness of Member State nationals to seek employment in the Union’s Civil Service and to continue in that employment.</p>
<p>The opinion expressed by the honourable Member "that it is impossible for Swedes to obtain a post in the Commission" is hard to sustain in the light of the statistics given above and in view of the fact that since 2000, more than 20 open competitions in all categories and for a wide variety of profiles have been organised to enable Swedish nationals, as well as nationals from the other Member States, to join the Commission. Furthermore, the validity of the lists of successful candidates established during the last enlargement transition period was extended until 30 June 2002 in order to maximise the opportunity for all qualified candidates to find a post with one of the Institutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission’s Communication on water management in developing countries<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 12 March 2002 states that priority should be given to 'ensuring a supply to every human being, especially the poorest and with a clear focus on the needs of women and children, of sufficient drinking water of good quality and adequate sanitation and hygiene, with the general objective of reducing poverty and improving people's health, quality of life and livelihood opportunities'.</p>
<p>It also states that pricing of water services should ensure financial sustainability, and that meeting the basic needs of poor and vulnerable groups requires the design of appropriate tariff structure and collection systems. It favours promoting public private partnerships, ensuring that those partnerships remain equitable, transparent, allow free and reversible choice on water services management, safeguard consumers’ and investors’ interests and maintain high standards of environmental protection.</p>
<p>As to the reform of state-owned enterprises in Africa, for some years developing countries have been under pressure, mainly from the Bretton Woods Institutions, to privatise their enterprises riddled with heavy losses and economic inefficiency. While recognising that public companies in Africa, especially in the water sector, often provide inadequate and low quality service to only a fraction of the urban population, there is a growing awareness that before deciding on a particular solution, such as privatisation, there is a need to objectively examine all the options, in order to select the most appropriate one. The Commission is currently preparing a Communication on this very important subject. Its main message will be the need to keep an open mind on State-owned enterprises reform issues, to put in place adequate regulatory frameworks and to establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure the protection of the public interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Support under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for public water supply schemes in the area of Connemara is made available through the Border Midland and Western Regional Operational Programme. The Rural Water Measure in that Programme sets out the broad strategic objectives for implementing the schemes. Decision-making in relation to the selection and approval of projects for funding is decentralised to implementing bodies at local level except where the cost of a project is greater than €50 million. In such cases the project is subject to a cost benefit analysis and the decision on the aid rate is made by the Commission. In the case of public water supply schemes the projects are all small-scale (eligible cost less than €50 million) with decision-making remaining at local level. No application in relation to the specific scheme in Connemara has therefore been submitted to the Commission.

<p>(FR) The measures proposed by the Commission are explained in detail in the communication on reinforcing maritime safety adopted on 3 December 2002.</p>
<p>With regard to flags of convenience and dangerous vessels in the territorial waters of the Union, the Commission decided to publish a so-called black list. This is a list of all those vessels that would have been banned from European ports if the measures in the Erika I package had been in force at the time. It is hoped the list will serve as a warning to the parties concerned, both ship owners and flag states. They could then take the measures required to remedy the deficiencies recorded prior to the actual entry into force of the new provisions in the directive concerning inspection by the state in which the port is located.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as requested by Parliament, the Commission believes it is necessary to adopt strict measures on maritime safety at international level regarding the so-called flags of convenience. These measures should include stricter navigation rules and more thorough inspection by the flag states. In this connection, under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) the Commission is cooperating in setting up an audit scheme for the duties incumbent on the flag states.</p>
<p>The Union should take the initiative and call for a review of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This would allow coastal states to protect themselves more effectively against the risks associated with the movement of vessels that represent a danger to the environment and fail to comply with safety regulations. The 200 mile exclusive economic zone would be covered.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0088"></a>

<p>The transport of oil from Primorsk is predicted to double in the next few years. The Russians are also planning two new oil-loading sites at the far end of the Gulf of Finland.</p>
<p>If a disastrous oil spill were to occur in the Gulf of Finland, it would be even harder to remedy – in view of the area’s island geography and the sensitive nature of its environment – than for example in Spain. Moreover the equipment for combating oil spills in many coastal countries is very inadequate. Apart from Finland, the countries bordering the Baltic do not have equipment which could operate in ice conditions.</p>
<p>What does the Commission propose to do to promote the implementation of effective ice-classification requirements for vessels in the whole of the Baltic Sea area, and what can it do to ensure that there is sufficient oil clearing equipment along the Baltic Sea coast which can operate in all conditions? What stage has work on the legislation on this matter reached?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Within the framework of measures already taken by the Union with a view to preventing oil tanker disasters, namely the Erika II legislative package, the directive on monitoring and control of maritime traffic applies to vessels moving past Community coasts. The directive therefore makes provision for setting up a system of notification which also covers vessels that do not enter Community ports. In addition, the directive empowers the competent authorities to prevent vessels putting to sea in very adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>When this directive comes into force, Member States will have additional powers to intervene in situations when there is a risk of accidents or pollution.</p>
<p>Further, the directive has put in place procedures for cooperation with a view to improving surveillance of vessels in Union waters. This paves the way for the submission of possible proposals for improvements to maritime traffic in the Baltic. It would be possible to press for their adoption within the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p>In addition, within the framework of the agreement between the European Union and Russia, there is provision for contact with the Russian authorities in order to ensure compliance with the measures planned by the Union with a view to ensuring the safe transport of hydrocarbons by sea. A ban on the transport of heavy fuel oils in single-hull tankers is one of the most significant of these measures.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it should be emphasised that the Union has no legal powers to control the movement of vessels carrying potentially hazardous cargoes in international waters. This is the case even when such movement is close to the coasts of Member States and even if the movement takes place in icy conditions such as those prevailing in the Baltic Sea in winter.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Union should take the initiative and call for a review of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The aim would be to allow coastal states to protect themselves more effectively against the potential dangers represented by the movement of vessels that pose a threat to the environment and fail to comply with safety standards. The 200 mile exclusive economic zone would be included.</p>
<p>Moreover, in case of accidents, Member States and candidate countries can activate the Community Mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in Civil Protection assistance interventions. In this way, any affected Country can have immediate access, through the European response centre, to all specialised equipment available in Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning the preparedness and response to marine pollution in the Baltic Sea, the Commission closely follows the works developed within the framework of the Helsinki Convention by the Helsinki Commission (Helcom).</p>
<p>Finally, the Interreg Community Initiative co-finances a transnational cooperation programme among the 11 countries around the Baltic Sea. Activities which can be funded include maritime safety and environmental protection actions. The programme budget is €190 million until the end of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0093"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that it has indeed written to the Greek authorities on a number of occasions between 1994 and 1996. It urged the latter to implement measures aimed at resolving what was then a serious problem. This involved a high number of artificially low tenders in the context of the award of public contracts, with the ensuing unrealistic contracts. Greece adopted the mathematical formula currently in use in order to remedy the situation, which was causing difficulties for Community financing of projects. At the time, the Greek authorities informed the Commission of their intention to carry out legislative reform and introduce the use of a mathematical formula in order to identify artificially low tenders for the award of public contracts. Nonetheless, the Commission was not formally consulted on the content of the relevant legislative texts.</p>
<p>Currently, Greece is not the only Member State using a mathematical formula to identify artificially low tenders for the award of public contracts. Italy and Spain are but two of the States also using a formula of this kind. For its part, the Court of Justice has ruled on the subject in the context of two cases brought before it<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It follows from the Court’s ruling that the use of a mathematical formula to identify artificially low tenders does not in itself constitute a violation of Community law. Certain details of the Greek system could, however, present problems of compliance with Community legislation and the jurisprudence of the Court.</p>
<p>The Commission wrote to the Greek authorities in order to clarify the situation and follow up related complaints. The Greek authorities were requested to elaborate on how they applied the mathematical formula to identify artificially low tenders. They have recently replied to the Commission’s letter.

<p>(EN) The Commission is regularly questioned about the consistency of competition policy when there are relocations of production facilities within the Union. The Commission would like first of all to underline that relocations are first and foremost the result of choices made by the enterprise in order to improve its competitiveness, either by reducing its overheads (wage costs, transport, raw materials, tax), or by rationalising its production tools. Decisions concerning the location of a new investment may thus be influenced by a number of factors, not only or principally the possibility of obtaining financial support from the public purse in order to make new investments. In any event, any public support of this kind, whether of national or Community origin must respect the Community rules on State aid.</p>
<p>The basic principle underlying the rules on State aid is that it is incompatible with the common market. However, exceptions may be made provided that the impact on trade and the distortion of competition which result from the granting of State aid are offset by an adequate contribution to the development of a disadvantaged region.</p>
<p>This is why one of the objectives of the cohesion policy, and the main aim of regional aid, is to provide an appropriate level of incentive necessary for the development of the assisted region. As far as the control of State aid is concerned, this policy is translated into practice by a system of ceilings on the level of aid depending on the degree and the urgency of the various regional problems.</p>
<p>The Commission takes account of potential relocation problems in the application of the Community rules on State aid so as to ensure that the harmful effects of aid on competition are offset by beneficial effects, notably in terms of cohesion. Thus, when it adopted the guidelines on national regional aid, the Commission reduced the level of aid authorised across the board in order to reduce the risks of regions attempting to outbid one another and to limit aid to what is strictly necessary. At the same time, the granting of regional aid was tied more strictly to conditions of duration in terms of the continuation of investment and jobs creation in the region concerned. Finally, large investment projects are subject to an even stricter discipline in the light of the provisions drawn up in the recent Multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects<a href="#defann_61_1" name="refann_61_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>According to these rules, the maximum aid intensity for regional investment aid in the motor vehicle sector, granted under an approved scheme in favour of projects that involve either eligible expenditure above € 50 million or an aid amount above € 5 million expressed in gross grant equivalent, will be equal to 30% of the corresponding regional aid ceiling.</p>
<p>Consequently, aid granted to an engine manufacturer in Wales after 1 January 2003 could only reach a maximum intensity of 10.5% of the investment costs, against an aid intensity of 35% until December 2002. In any event, the Commission will contact the United Kingdom authorities in order to confirm that any aid granted to engine manufacturers conforms to the Community rules applicable.</p>
<p>Regarding the aid granted to a motor vehicle manufacturer in Valencia, Spain, in May 2002 the Commission approved, after an in-depth investigation € 11.11 million in investment aid to Ford España for its Almusafes (Valencia) plant, with a reduction of 30% of the amount initially planned by the Spanish authorities. The Commission’s investigation lead to the conclusion that the approved aid was necessary to compensate for the regional disadvantages of the Valencia region, and was therefore compatible with the common market.</p>
<p>As regards the potential relocation of production to the Candidate Countries as a consequence of state aid, the Commission has consistently taken the view that the Candidate Countries can be regarded to be ready for accession only if their companies and public authorities have become accustomed to a competition and state aid discipline similar to that of the Community well before the date of accession. Candidate Countries are required to comply with the criteria of the Community state aid acquis already during the pre-accession period.</p>
<p>The Commission has advocated this strict approach not only to preserve the internal market discipline after enlargement, but also to keep a level playing field between future and existing Member States in the enlarged internal market. This strict approach applies in particular to such a sensitive issue as aid to the motor vehicle industry. Therefore, the guiding principle remains that lower aid intensities have to be maintained in this sector, regardless of whether the beneficiary is investing in the current or future Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 1961 UN Convention on Drugs classifies cannabis in Schedule I along with the most dangerous drugs such as heroin, and in Schedule IV includes Schedule I drugs that are considered to have limited therapeutic value and extremely dangerous properties. The 1988 UN Convention considers the principal element of cannabis, THC, only as a psychotropic substance. The logicality of these classifications consequently raises serious doubts: in fact a plant containing 3% of a principal element is dealt with more severely than the pure substance at 100%.</p>
<p>Does the Commission think that: cannabis classification in Schedule I along with heroin is appropriate? cannabis is as dangerous as heroin? cannabis classification in Schedule IV is appropriate? cannabis has no medical value? cannabis should be treated more severely than its principal element? the Commission should propose amendments to the Council and to Member States for reclassification of cannabis under the UN Conventions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The issue of the consistency of the classification of drugs dates back to the adoption of the first UN Convention on Drugs in 1961, known as the Single Convention. Cannabis is indeed classified together with heroin. The difficulties arose because there is no clear definition of the concept of a narcotic in the texts. Classification is therefore based mainly on the medicinal properties of the substances in question.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding possible reclassification of cannabis is certainly complex. It is for the parties to the Convention to rule on the issue. The Commission is not in a position to become involved, as it only has observer status on the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The Commission cannot therefore table amendments on the subject.

Furthermore, betting and gaming can be considered as services if they are provided for remuneration.

<p>The Commission would like to underline that Member States may impose some restrictions on the cross-border provision of services and on the free movement of gambling machines within the Community to protect general interest objectives such as the protection of consumers or the maintenance of public order in society.

<p>(FR) It is for the Commission alone to decide on opening regional representations. This can only be justified if the citizens of a particular region have a significant and clearly identified need for information on European issues. There must be no other way of meeting this need. Decentralisation of information then allows the need to be met effectively, by providing first-hand information appropriate to local conditions. Account is also taken of the specific geographical situation and of the considerable powers devolved to some regional administrations.</p>
<p>There are administrative and budgetary constraints on the policy of opening regional representations in Member States. In the context of administrative preparations for enlargement in 2004, new representations in each of the future Member States have priority. The demands on administrative capacity and financial resources are such that it is not currently possible to contemplate opening a regional representation in Thessalonica.</p>
<p>Concerning this last point in particular, information centres constitute an alternative to regional representations. This has been the case in Thessalonica. In 1999 a European centre for communication, information and culture was established.

<p>The Directorate-General for Research is actively involved in preparing the study concerning the consequences of the new Basle II regulations which is based on a decision by the Barcelona European Council, and in respect of which the Directorate-General for the Internal Market, as the unit responsible, issued an invitation to tender. Accordingly, and particularly in view of the extremely important consequences of Basle II for the research and development activities of small and medium-sized European firms, I should like to ask the Commission when the results of this study can be expected to be available. The planned publication of the Basle II impact study for the European Council in late autumn 2003 seems too late, in any event. It is very important that the results of the study should be available during Basle II's third consultation period, which runs from May to August 2003.

<p>(EN) The European Council at its Meeting in Barcelona in 2002 requested the Commission ‘to present a report on the consequences of the Basel deliberations for all sectors of the European economy with particular attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>The Commission has warmly welcomed the opportunity presented by this request. It considers it highly desirable and important to assess the likely consequences of the new capital requirements framework – which are of significant importance and potential benefit to the Union economy.</p>
<p>The issues concerned in such a report are of course very complex. The Commission developed a detailed and considered call for tenders which it launched in July 2002. The call evoked considerable interest.</p>
<p>The intention of the Commission has been consistently that the Consequences Report should be finalised and made available before the adoption of a Directive proposal by the Commission. This is necessary and desirable in order that it may inform the finalisation of the proposal and the subsequent legislative procedures. This should contribute significantly to the democratic process.</p>
<p>At an advanced stage in the tendering procedure, a formal irregularity was detected and as a consequence it was decided to close the call and launch a new tender. This is going ahead imminently and will take place using an accelerated tendering procedure.</p>
<p>It is the Commission’s intention that the report should be finalised by the end of 2003. This will be only a short period behind the originally scheduled finalisation date of September 2003 and means that the report will, as planned, be available in advance of the adoption of a Directive proposal in the first part of 2004.</p>
<p>In all of this, it must be remembered that it is of great importance – as the Parliament itself has stated – that the new framework should be implemented in Member States in line with the Basel deadline of end-of-year 2006. This is necessary to ensure that the European financial services industry is not to be disadvantaged as compared with its global competitors.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Commission has just concluded a very successful ‘Structured Dialogue’ exercise with industry – including with SMEs. It is intended to make comments received during this exercise publicly available on the Commission’s website in the near future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0129"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for its question concerning the reduction in interest rates on deposits, particularly in Greece, and the adverse effect that this may have on small depositors.</p>
<p>The liberalisation of financial markets in the Community is largely achieved. The successful introduction of the euro has been a catalyst in this.</p>
<p>Within this context, financial markets are highly competitive ones and individual institutions, whilst being influenced by common factors such as a change in the market borrowing/lending rate, arrange the conditions applied to their customers according to their own individual strategy, balance sheet and other considerations.</p>
<p>Although there have from time to time been ad-hoc investigations into alleged collusion or coordination between institutions concerning conditions applied to customers, no evidence has so far been found of collusion or of an abuse of a collectively dominant position in Greece.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this stage there are no concrete indications for an infringement of Articles 81 or 82 of the Treaty. However, the Commission has brought this matter to the attention of the Greek competition authority which is best placed to monitor the retail banking market in Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0131"></a>

<p>(EN) According to the information received from the Greek authorities, two of the three helicopters that have crashed over the last months had been co-financed by the Community through the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 for Greece, in particular under the Operational Programme "Health and welfare". More precisely, the programme mentioned financed the procurement of five helicopters with a total cost of € 17.8 million, of which € 13.3 million were contributed by the Community. The delivery of helicopters began on 24 December 1999 (first helicopter) and was completed on 29 March 2000 (fifth helicopter).</p>
<p>According to Council Directive 94/56/EC of 21 November 1994 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, every accident has to be investigated by an independent body established in each Member State with the sole objective of preventing future accident. A report containing, where appropriate, safety recommendations has to be published, if possible within one year of the accident, and a copy has to be sent to the Commission. It will be the exclusive responsibility of the Member State to enforce the possible safety recommendation to prevent re-occurrence of these accidents.</p>
<p>Moreover, in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 of 11 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organisation of an information system in this field<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, if in the light of the circumstances of these accidents the Greek authorities conclude that the expenditure on helicopters constitutes an irregularity because of deficiencies in the tendering or contracting process (as distinct from operational issues), it is the Member State's responsibility to communicate to the Commission this irregularity, and this before the submission of the final payment claim for the related programme ("Health and welfare").</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
