<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mention has already been made of the fact that the rapporteur, Karl von Wogau, is unable to be here. He himself explained why during his intervention on the Lamfalussy report. Because the order of business was changed at such short notice, he was unable to change his appointments so that he could be here in person. I should like to point out that the Lamfalussy report and this economic report were originally scheduled for the beginning of the day and that the rapporteur arranged this evening’s discussion with voters in his constituency some time ago. May I apologise on his behalf once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall endeavour to do my best under the circumstances. There are a number of points which I wish to address. First, this is the last year before euro notes and coins are introduced. The internal market of the European Union will then become a real European home market, at least for the members of the euro zone. Twelve Member States will belong to this European home market, in which individuals and companies will all share a common currency. It is therefore right and proper that we should carry out a careful analysis of the European economy in this context. This has now already begun: the forecasts for the current year and the analysis of the status quo are basically optimistic, although they do of course contain a number of risk factors, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">One positive factor which deserves a mention in any critique or proposed improvement is the relatively high rate of growth in our Gross Domestic Product. Another positive factor is that the rate of unemployment is falling and we have created 2.5 million new jobs in the European Union over recent years. Yet another positive factor is the improvement in public finances – and the concomitant reduction in the rate of inflation – and long-term price stability. So much for the pros.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are two factors which need to be mentioned which could give cause for concern: the first is the present economic climate in the United States. Growth in the United States is slowing down and, given the impact of strong growth in the USA on European trade, this may undermine the EU economy although, on the positive side, we are becoming increasingly immune to economic developments in America and this represents a positive balance and positive justification for our measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is the slowdown in the European economy. According to forecasts, the average rate of growth will be 2.8%. I should therefore like to state quite unequivocally that we need to call on the Member States again today to do more to translate the will to engage in reform into practice and to implement sustainable structural measures. We must be critical of the fact that consolidation efforts have come to a standstill in numerous countries. I would just point out that we should be even more critical of consolidation efforts in that the majority of countries have still not met their self-imposed targets in the stability and growth package despite the boom in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area which we need to touch on is the fact that we must congratulate the ECB because its “steady hand” policy has proven to be the right policy. The ECB should continue on this stability-oriented course and should also implement its own European stability-oriented policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a few demands. The rate of inflation must be kept below 2% in the second half of the year. The telecommunications, mail, energy and railway sectors must be liberalised quickly and in a balanced manner. We need to step up efforts in education and training. We need a more flexible labour market and we need structural reforms of the markets for goods, services, capital and labour to be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to close by saying that the main request in Karl von Wogau’s report is contained in the reference to the common principles which derive from our social market economy principles, i.e. freedom and democracy, competition, price stability and sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity and private property and the responsibility not only of the employer towards the employee but of both towards the future, and hence for ensuring that the social market economy evolves into an eco-social market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our citizens will finally hold it in their hands. It has all the right talents: the economic clout of 12 of the 15 Member States of the EU, low rates of inflation, falling national debts and historically low interest rates. It will be well protected by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main – which knows all there is to know about stability, and really has done what Othmar Karas said, i.e. operated a “steady-hand” policy, which is now paying off. Anyone who has managed to withstand the pessimism, the years of being underrated like the euro has, is worth investing in.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the euro zone, with over 2.5 million new jobs in three years is good, although caution is needed in the face of the slowdown in the United States. Growth and investment forecasts are being revised downwards everywhere. There is the threat of weakening exports and increasing problems in funding social security systems. The euphoria over the new economy has fallen into the abyss along with the fall in share prices. Today it would appear that the old economy is not so old after all. We must take strategic precautions: economic policy, monetary policy and social policy must be coordinated. We must improve the framework conditions for innovative start ups. We must make it easier to invest in information and communications technologies. Now more than ever, the Member States need to get on and reform their education and training plans, which should be geared to the challenges of these new technologies and the increasing need for mobility. Higher qualifications improve employability, especially in the knowledge society which we keep on talking about. We also need to secure permanent and effective social protection, and this can only be done if those in political power put funding right at the top of their agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The social partners’ agenda needs to include maintaining jobs for older people, creating more jobs and giving employees a share in company profits. The social market economy, which Karl von Wogau frequently refers to, is reflected in his excellent report. We in the PPE-DE Group agreed with him unanimously. It includes liberalisation and solidarity, competition and equal opportunities and environmentally-friendly growth. The social market economy is more than just an economic model. This social model will be the basis for the new European home market which Karl von Wogau has been forecasting, and that does have a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I rather thought that the euro had already been born and thank goodness it has, because just imagine what would have happened between the European economies if the European currencies were still competing with each other now that the American economy has gone into decline. But that is by the by.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur said, the year 2000 was a good year for the European economy, from the point of view of the rate of growth, from the point of view of price stability and from the point of view of employment. Of course, nothing is perfect in this imperfect world and, as the rapporteur points out, the rate of inflation is set to exceed 2%, the stability criteria set by the European Bank, for the second year running, but not to a sufficiently serious extent to give us particular cause for concern. From our point of view, we would have considered it more worthwhile to stress that, although certain progress has been and is still being made, unemployment is still at 8%, which is unacceptably high in a social market economy, the principles of which the rapporteur feels – and I agree with him – should guide our policy. In this respect, I am surprised that, in listing the features of a social<span class="bold"> </span>market economy, the rapporteur does not include full employment in his list, despite the fact that he comes from a country in which cooperation between companies and employees is, I think, the most advanced or one of the most advanced in Europe and does the German economy and German society proud.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, full employment should be the be all and end all of a modern economy. Not, as you might assume, for ideological reasons, although of course ideological reasons are not easily dismissed, but for reasons of competitiveness. An economy does not become competitive merely by achieving low costs or by having leading edge technology. Competitiveness is judged by whether it makes full use of its wealth-creating resources in comparison with other economies. Unless it does, it will not manage to become competitive, which is precisely why full employment – and not just full employment but increasing the ratio between the adult population and the work force by 60% for women and 70% for men – is not just a social, it is primarily an economic demand, and why it is at the epicentre of the policy which was announced by the Council summit in Lisbon and which will be reiterated, I hope, at the coming Council summit in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take every opportunity to remind ourselves and the citizens of Europe that our Union has engaged in a huge economic venture in order to gain its rightful place at the economic vanguard of the world. This venture is based on the triad of a knowledge economy, full employment and renovation of the social state. These three factors form a unit, each feeds the other and they express the exact link between social solidarity and economic competitiveness. Just as there is no such thing as efficient solidarity without competitiveness, competitiveness will collapse if it is not built on social solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur insists on the technological aspects of economic superiority. We believe that equal weight must be given to social aspects such as equal opportunities, a fair distribution of income and closing the gap between the rich and the poor. And if we too had made an effort to impose self-control on the markets at worldwide level, at least to the extent to which we are able to exert an influence, we would perhaps not now have reached a point at which we are threatened by the imminent economic crisis in the United States. I do not know what happened to close Wall Street. At lunchtime it was still in free fall and it is threatening to drag us down into a slump with it. We must protect ourselves from the extremes of a non-social economy. If we want a social economy, we must give it real meaning, based on solidarity and the fight against speculation; words alone will get us nowhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always argued that, in the Europe of the euro, there should be a genuine and well-defined leadership for economic and monetary policy. It is well known that, at the moment, it is produced by means of negotiations between ECOFIN and the Commission, with the intervention of Parliament. The broad guidelines are clearly a fundamental element, but – I repeat – it is still in our view a substitute for what should be a genuine economic and monetary policy at European Union level with the opportunity to act in a more direct manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the different aspects dealt with in Mr von Wogau’s report, I would like to highlight three, which, from our liberal perspective, are particularly important. The first is to push ahead with the process of liberalisation in sectors such as telecommunications, postal services, railways, etc., sectors which still hinder the possibility of achieving higher levels of competitiveness and a single market which functions better. This process would also, as Mr Bolkestein correctly pointed out, lead to better functioning of the single market and the disappearance of barriers within it. This better functioning – as Parliament approved in my report on structural reforms and liberalisation – would in particular guarantee a profound reform of the labour markets, an essential element, firstly, in better adapting to the economic and social needs of European society and, secondly, in achieving what we need, that is, higher levels of productivity in order to be competitive on an international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main reason is the boost in exports to the US dollar area as a result of the current economic climate there and the weak euro. So the basic principle reads: a weak euro is good for an export-oriented economy and hence good for Europe. It is true that, at over 2%, the rate of inflation in Europe does not meet the stability criteria for the introduction of the euro, mainly as a result of higher oil prices, which are traded in dollars. So then the basic principle reads: a weak euro is bad for the European economy. This illustrates the absurdity of reducing economic policy measures to fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the number of unemployed has fallen over recent years. But it is also true that unemployment in Objective 1 regions has not fallen, because they do not tend to have an export-oriented economy. So we have no convergence, just continuing divergence, i.e. a deepening social divide. It is true that investments have increased over recent years. But it is also true that most were rationalisation and non-expansion investments and that public investment in infrastructure has fallen.</p>
<p class="contents">What has all this to do with a forward-looking economic policy? The report does not contain a single proposal on strengthening domestic demand, on the specific issue of small and medium-sized enterprises, on strengthening regional economic cycles, on European tax harmonisation, on implementing the Lisbon employment summit, mentioning instead simply liberalisation, privatisation, falling social standards and the abolition of public-funded health and pension funds. The von Wogau report must be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Less pleasing is the fact that the inflation rate has again crossed the 2% threshold and investments have fallen from 5.3% to 4.9% of Gross Domestic Product.

<p class="contents">But we must also back and reform our education systems so that the lack of expertise threatening us does not in fact become a reality.

<p class="contents">Nor can the Central Bank take all the blame for not including the stimulus of growth and the pursuit of full employment amongst its priorities in setting interest rates, in addition to the containment of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now becoming clear how urgent it is to bring into being a genuine form of closer cooperation between the twelve countries of the eurozone, so as to make a qualitative leap in the coordination of financial, economic and social policies, and overcome – as was called for at the Lisbon Summit – a rigidly sectoral approach which, ultimately, confines social policies to a role of mere assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">That might also be the way to establish a coordinated presence of the monetary Union as such in institutional decision-making forums like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank and, in addition, the relations of the eurozone with third countries, in particular with the producer countries of raw materials and energy sources. For example, a long-term agreement with oil producers with a controlled price in euro would be not only possible but desirable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? The impression we are giving is that the European Union is very passive. There are the movements of the global market, there is the policy of the United States, and we are looking on. With regard to these events we are far from having an economic policy. We do not have a doctrine of public economy in Europe and we are therefore a bit closeted here, I would say, in the Ministry of Words.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make three observations. Firstly, the analysis of economic conditions presented by the Central Bank and by the Commission could, in fact, be summed up more or less by a slowdown in the global space, even though, for us, the growth indicators are good for the next few months, that is for the coming 18 months, and do not encourage us to budge.</p>
<p class="contents">We are lamentably lacking initiatives to consolidate the potential and perhaps real growth of the European Union. For my part, I would lay great stress on the need for public and private investments and on the accumulated delays in the matter of research and training. Instead of that, the report unfortunately takes up the anti-inflationist obsession we also find in the discourse of the Central Bank, and the failure of the Galileo project would be disastrous.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have said that the social policy was necessary to consolidate growth. In the words of Emilio Gabaglio, the impression is that we are witnessing a sort of derailment between Lisbon and Stockholm. We should give concrete expression to our desire to develop knowledge and skills in the European Union in the form of a spectacular initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we talk about an acceleration of balanced liberalisation. The debate between competition and service of general interest has only just started. I am convinced that the internal market will not come to fruition unless we impose obligations to provide services of general interest at the Community level. Here too, we lack initiatives. I hope that the next few months will prove me wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank Mr von Wogau for his report, Mr Karas for his presentation and all of you for your speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, for the first time, the procedures for debating the broad economic policy guidelines have been modified as a result of the Lisbon procedure and you have had the opportunity to introduce a Parliamentary position on this debate which should, in principle, help us to define that economic policy which you – Mr Trentin, amongst others – have referred to and to which we are not attaching sufficient importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission agree with the fundamental principles contained in the report, both paragraph one and paragraph two, relating to the social market economy and an economy based on a democratic model, price stability, sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity etc., which are objectives we share fully.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the point some of you have made in relation to the importance of this moment in time, since we are now less than 300 days away from the introduction of the euro. However, as always, I must repeat that we often confuse the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January next year with the introduction of the euro which took place on 1 January 1999, and which has already brought us clear benefits and positive results, as some of you have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst these positive results is the healthy economic situation the European Union currently enjoys. We must not rest on our laurels, because this healthy economic situation nevertheless masks certain deficiencies, certain problems caused by external factors, a certain lack of ambition in considering budgets and, above all, there are certain risks caused, in particular, by the development of economies such as the US economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this specific point, however, I would like to insist that the euro is also protecting us from the process of slowdown, which is affecting economies outside the European Union. The Commission’s position, which is still relatively optimistic in relation to the process of growth in Europe during 2001, is based on the fact that currently we in Europe still clearly have an historic level of confidence in consumers and producers, employment is still clearly improving and inflation has reached its ceiling. In this context, we believe that the obligation of those responsible for economic policy is, above all, to maintain short-term economic expansion. Therefore, according to our view of the issue, we insist that we need to continue to maintain a budgetary policy aimed at balancing public finances. We also believe that wage policy must be compatible with non-inflationist growth and the creation of employment and that monetary policy must remain committed to price stability. There is no doubt that monetary policy would benefit from a coherent tax policy and greater liberalisation of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have also raised the concern that employment is the fundamental issue. This is patently a key point. We therefore also insist – as we have done in our presentations of reports for Stockholm – on the increase in the Union’s growth potential. In our report on the 2000 review of the Union’s economy, the Commission studied the impact of expenditure and production in information and communication technologies and the advantages they could provide in relation to the possible increase in our growth potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the structural reforms to which Mr Gasòliba referred are a fundamental point, but we must also focus on other shortcomings. Firstly, in Lisbon we focussed on the knowledge economy as a key and fundamental element. If we wish to make progress in this respect we must also create the right conditions for private-sector investment in research and development and in the new technologies. We also have to improve research and, at the same time, increase professional training for the new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural reforms are regularly mentioned. There is no doubt that we have made progress and that is clear from the report on the implementation of this year’s broad economic policy guidelines, but we must not view this progress as completely satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission still insists on the need to continue making progress on these issues and, as you know, the Commission just yesterday presented new proposals to move ahead on the liberalisation of the energy market. We are aware that we have to seek a balance between liberalisation and regulation in order to achieve the best possible economic results from this process. We also agree that we have to make progress on the whole issue of creating more efficient and more integrated financial markets. You have just held a debate with Mr Bolkestein on the need to implement the procedures originating from the so-called Lamfalussy committee. There is no doubt that this is a step towards speeding up the processes of liberalising the financial services, but we believe that this is not sufficient and we also have to continue to make progress in relation to risk capital and the improvement of risk capital in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market must be another of our main concerns if we wish to make progress on employment. A better combination of fiscal reforms and supply systems will certainly have a positive influence on the behaviour of the working population, as it must also help to create a better balance between wages and productivity on a local level, improve employment in certain areas and will also have a positive influence on certain factors such as the mobility of labour or better work organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern, which we do not believe is sufficiently highlighted in this report, concerns the problems of the long-term sustainability of public finances. The problems relating to the ageing of the population are going to be one of the key issues and in order to deal with them we are clearly going to have to take measures on public debt and measures for improving the labour market, by achieving a greater level of activity, a greater level of employment, in particular of women and older workers, which can also help to counter some of these effects, as will reforms of the current social security systems which are coherent with employment and sustainability of the model.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all of you for your speeches, your comments and your positive contributions to the report, which we will take into account when it comes to drawing up our proposed broad economic policy guidelines for next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
