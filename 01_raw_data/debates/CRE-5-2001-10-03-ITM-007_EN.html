<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hieronymi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the Television without frontiers directive is to establish an EU legal framework to promote the free circulation of audio-visual broadcasting services and to guarantee certain particularly important interests, such as pluralism, cultural diversity, and the protection of consumers and minors. We have before us today the Commission's report on the application of the directive for the period 1997 to 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The key points to emerge from this report are as follows. The main objectives of the directive have been achieved, but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed. The five main points of the report, very briefly, are these: firstly, the directive has been implemented in 12 Member States, with three yet to follow suit. Secondly, the television sector experienced an overall phase of continuous growth between 1997 and 2000. This applies both to the number of television channels and also to the total turnover of radio and television broadcasters and to the advertising turnover of both state-owned and private broadcasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report indicates that when it comes to trade in television programmes, Europe has a deficit with the United States of some USD 2.9 billion, while the overall deficit of the audio-visual sector is some USD 6.6 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the 50% quota for European works was clearly exceeded, except in Portugal, falling in a range between 53% and 81%. Fourthly, although the provisions on the protection of minors were complied with overall, there needs to be better coordination in future. Fifthly, four countries have so far made use of the new provisions under Article 3a about broadcasting events of particular importance to the community, and four others are planning to take advantage of those provisions, particularly for sporting events. The committee noted shortcomings in the report with regard to implementation in the candidate countries and in the analysis of trends in media concentration.</p>
<p class="contents">The digital era is now on the way, and the integration of television, PCs and the Internet requires a fundamental revision of the TWF directive so as to create a European legal framework for broadcasting audio-visual material with various degrees of regulation. The cornerstones of this should be as follows: first, the rules on advertising should be reviewed and made more flexible; second, the quota arrangements should be reviewed to see if they can continue to be a suitable instrument for promoting European works; third, we must guarantee open and compatible standards for various systems covering rights of access; fourth, there is a need for stronger and more effective self-regulation, particularly as regards the protection of minors; fifth, the trends in vertical and horizontal integration of the media should be analysed, and sixth, a review of the arrangements under Article 3a and how they are to be dealt within future is required. I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 which have been tabled here.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparations for this review process should take into account the exceptional impact of television and new technology on democracy and society, particularly in the digital era. The process of gauging public opinion therefore needs to be carried out openly, in a way that takes account of both experts in the audio-visual sector and the views of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">So I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has provided for a broad communication process, and we hope, Commissioner, that in view of the speed with which digital technology is developing you will bring forward your proposed review as soon as possible. However, I would like to make an appeal to everyone: we must take advantage of the opportunities for dialogue over the next 18 months to demonstrate that the European Parliament cares about what matters to the public, especially when cultural issues are involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome Mrs Hieronymi's report and salute her for it. It goes to the heart of the cultural diversity that we prize in Europe. We defend public service obligations – however the service concerned may be financed – and the principles of universal access, which constantly come back in all of our debates now about technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken heed of the imbalance in the European audio-visual market place, and I hope the Commissioner will be able speak on this. Since 1999 the revenues of European television companies have grown by an average of 46.3%. In that time, public-service broadcasting hardly grew at all and creative television production in the five major producing countries of the European Union was sluggish or, in some cases, falling. At the same time, US programme sales to Europe – programmes which, as we know, are reaping their tertiary reward, having already cleared their primary and secondary rewards in the US market directly and by satellite and cable – grew massively. That is not a healthy situation. The protection of the diverse market in Europe remains crucial. The imperatives of the technology should be linked to what consumers need, as well as what the production empires want to sell.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3a, referred to earlier by the rapporteur, shows what can be done to keep the widest audience for special events. I too support Mrs Junker's amendments and others on the same point. It was a major change for the better and it showed that we can intervene here and in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to return to the issue of media concentration and how that relates to the public good, not just in terms of diversity but also in terms of raw political power.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we ought to be able to say to the applicant countries: do as we do and not merely as we say. That means having rules that are observed, for them as well as for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This area, which was subject to innovative legislation thirteen years ago, has clearly changed radically and to an amazing extent. The same even applies to the update we passed in 1997: everything has been left behind by the driving force of new technologies and also fashion. We are thus increasingly sure that the review of this directive, until now expected for 2002, will be brought forward to the beginning of next year, without waiting for too many months to go by.</p>
<p class="contents">The last five years have, in fact seen a veritable revolution in the television sector; the old TV has now become a supporting actor, a technical tool in the service of digital innovation, the webcasting invasion, the Internet and interactive relationships between user and broadcaster. A global, up-to-date review is also needed because of all the other problems that directly or indirectly surround the world of television, such as the increase in turnover of the networks, the steady and increasingly disturbing invasion by advertising, the explosion of private broadcasters, and the growing social and moral implications of certain programming.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the directive needs to be broadened to embrace not only the subjects mentioned above but also others that are already included but are insufficiently developed, such as the problems of intellectual property, respect for children as often unsupervised users, the cultural levels of programmes – taking into account not only the interests and requirements of those who make them but especially the feelings of those at whom these products are targeted – and lastly the confrontation with American productions, a subject on which there was quite a harsh confrontation in 1997 but which remained to a great extent unresolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on this subject, I also hope we can again discuss the so-called ‘right to information’, a right which, because of equal opportunities, should clearly concern not only the citizens of the European Union but also all those living outside who receive programmes produced inside the EU. It is not enough just to guarantee the great sporting events, as we did in 1997, since man does not live on football alone – if you will forgive the pun. We must distribute constantly updated information, based on culture and constantly updated, not only to those who live within the European Union but especially to those less favoured by geographical location or social and economic status. Everybody’s ‘right to a satellite dish’ is not enough: you need the money to get one. Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world. The most precious aid is that reserved for the production of programmes designed to report, safeguard and make proposals, in the sense of safeguarding regional and local cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me renew an invitation to the Member States. The rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and whose amendments and positions I support, reminded us that only twelve Member States have so far implemented the directive. Well, Commissioner, let us take this opportunity to give the Member States this message again: believe in this directive, because it will become increasingly urgent, current and important, and if you believe us you must first of all implement it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is needed because the context in which the televisual market operates, as it has been described, is so different from what it was when the directive was last revised that it does not seem feasible to retain the latter for a further two or three years. As an estimate, we could say that at most, the directive only covers some 50% of the problems currently experienced in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, revision is required because we need to come up with solutions which were not provided at the time. Television remains the main source of information and entertainment for most Europeans. In my view, apart from the issue of the low quality of content, it is beset by three main problems. Too much advertising is broadcast, with no thought for its suitability or the ages and timings involved. Only rarely are European films broadcast, which is an affront to European culture. The business of digitalising programmes so they can be shown on subscription channels has taken off.</p>
<p class="contents">Doubtless these problems already existed in 1996, but the situation is now critical. This suggests that although the directive has been successful as far as the free circulation of television services within the Community is concerned, it has failed in other important areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication does not allow us to assess the efforts Member States made to redress the situation in the three years under scrutiny. Suffice it to say that three Member States did not even transpose the directive into their legislation. Most probably, the results for the remaining Member States were not identical, but the Commission has not made such a comparative study available. There is little detail on the situation in the candidate countries. This should feature prominently in the new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Mrs Hieronymi has refrained from launching an in-depth debate in her report. I believe she was wise to do so. This debate should take place when the directive is revised, and she has requested such a revision. A number of guidelines to inform the process have been laid down. I should like to refer to just a few of these, namely the urgent need to introduce new services based on new technologies, the need to stimulate and accelerate the transition to digital technology and the coordination of the new directive with the revision of the directive on electronic commerce.</p>

The Commission’s report states that the next report on the directive must also address issues which are important to the consumer, such as operational compatibility, conditional access and how the transition to digital broadcast technology will take place, but the world may already have moved on by the time the next report is drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind everyone that, when debating the ‘telecom package’, Parliament approved by a large majority the fact that we should demand an open, common standard for TV transmitters and receivers, the only one so far approved in Europe and known as the MHP standard. This standard would guarantee a situation in which all consumers knew what applied and one in which they had the confidence to acquire the necessary equipment. It would also guarantee that vertically divided markets did not arise. A large majority of Parliament backed this view.</p>
<p class="contents">But what has happened since then? The Commission does not support this decision, and the Council has entirely ignored the issue, which I believe is of immense importance if we are to achieve what is known as Digital Update and promote digital technology in all TV markets. I therefore hope that the Commission in its entirety can start to support the demands which have been made by Parliament and which we in the ELDR Group would like to clarify a little. The rapporteur has already pointed out this requirement, but I would like to repeat it in order to make it clear to all the services of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have said that ‘Television without Frontiers’ is a loaded title for the directive. There is also a special set of problems in this context. In many cases we see that the directive has not functioned in the intended manner with regard to opinion-formers or individual consumers who wish to view TV from another country. The Commission has found that the way in which copyright is handled prevents it from doing so. I hope that this issue too will be debated in greater depth in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it raises some very important issues and it is important to start that dialogue now.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal concern is the role of public service broadcasters in this important agenda. It is important to recognise that today's public service broadcasting needs to adapt to the changes. Today's radio and TV sector is a competitive one and the market forces which largely govern it cannot be ignored. Public service broadcasters have a crucial role to play in the digital world. Public service broadcasters make programmes of high quality in indigenous languages reflecting indigenous cultures. They also have a crucial role to play in encouraging people to use and understand the new digital media. I agree with the Commissioner's statement in a recent communication that broadcasting and culture should remain within the WTO's services category and that this arrangement should be respected. Having established that, we then need to be absolutely certain that there is sufficient scope for national and EU legislation to protect public services and cultural entities. Robust and determined early regulatory action will be needed to create the open environment we all seek, and one which is in the real interests of all citizens and economies of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has to compete in the digital world where consumers and citizens can wander freely and where competition delivers diversity and choice. With its complementary mix then of private and public service broadcasters, the European audiovisual model guarantees pluralism of information, cultural diversity and access for all to information, education, entertainment and the arts. I will be voting in favour of the report and look forward very much to the forthcoming debates as we look to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important. The first is the importance of the audiovisual sector in promoting sport. We must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together, as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin, and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events. They must not be a privilege for the few, since these events are of great importance to our society.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the need to control advertising slots, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur when she backs the Commission’s strategy of carrying out a study on the repercussions of television advertising and TV shopping techniques on minors.</p>
<p class="contents">And the third issue I would like to highlight is my total support for the rapporteur’s request that the Member States strengthen dialogue and cooperation on all issues relating to the protection of minors and young people. We cannot aspire to a world without violence when our future adults spend the day watching increasingly violent animated cartoons, films and news items. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That implies a growth of around 180% in just four years. These figures alone should be enough to illustrate that the conventional television market, which only covers a small part of the overall audio-visual sector, is a major growth sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report shows that the Television without frontiers directive, which was originally highly controversial in my own country in particular, has proved its worth. It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting. In the period covered by the report, 50 channels were already aiming chiefly at markets outside their local area. The TWF directive closed various regional legal gaps and created binding standards for areas including advertising and the protection of minors, thus creating a level playing field in terms of equal opportunities and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out. However, it also makes it clear that we need to embark as quickly as possible on a new review of the TWF directive, if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving developments in the audio-visual sector in a time of increasing digitalisation. That applies not only to the provision of all kinds of multimedia services, it also involves an appropriate approach to the trend in concentration of the media, which is also progressing at a pace that is hard to follow. The other side of the coin is the need to ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and pluralism, and to establish an essential multimedia foundation to promote European cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her achievement has been demonstrated by the wide consensus she has obtained on this important but extremely sensitive subject. I agree with the general philosophy of her report and with the proposals it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the method used, I think it is regrettable that the results obtained were not evaluated in relation to the set objectives. This would have produced a better picture of the real cultural and economic implications of this directive for each of the Member States and candidate countries. On the other hand, I support the wish of the rapporteur and the Commission to propose a revision of the directive, and to do this in parallel with the revision of other directives, after initiating three in-depth studies. Only an overall approach will lead in the medium term to the development of a coherent and forceful policy. Please note I am talking about an approach. This is something that the directive does not at present provide. The audiovisual sector has undergone profound changes. New services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters. As a result, the sector has been completely transformed. Consequently, if we want to ensure the continuity of our audiovisual sector, we must now widen the scope of the directive. I have a number of concerns on this matter. There continues to be an imbalance between European cinema production and imports from the United States. European films rarely reach a European Union audience outside the country where they are produced. Six per cent of European films are shown outside their country of origin. Of the total volume of programs, 74% are fictional works imported from America and only 14% are European in origin. As well as simply exporting programmes, major industry players are promoting the export of American thematic television channels to Europe. These are sold both to digital grouping operators and cable satellite channels. In addition, Europe lags considerably behind the United States in the development of the digital sector.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the difficult issues confronting us. This is why I believe that the only possible response is global and proactive action by the European Union. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly very important, is the key issue of our cultures, identities and the values we hold dear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This commitment demonstrates that Parliament understands the importance of the Television without frontiers directive and its implementation. I would like to remind honourable Members that Mrs Hieronymi’s report does not deal with the development of television in general, nor is it about cinema. It deals with the Commission’s report on the implementation of the Television without frontiers directive between 1997 and 2000. I completely agree with those Members who deplore the state of European cinema, and are critical of both the quality of films and the industry’s economic role. I would like to remind them that last week the Commission published its report on cinema. Mr President, I am sure Parliament will have the opportunity to begin a wide-ranging debate on the development of cinema in Europe. I wish it well. However, the issues relating to television are slightly different. I would like to draw your attention to the promotion of the distribution and production of television programs (as outlined in Articles 4 and 5 of the directive). It can be seen that the weighted average of European programmes broadcast by the major channels is between 53 and 81%, with the exception of one country. It should also be noted that the majority of Member States have introduced more rigorous legislation than that provided for by the directive. Fortunately, the situation is far better for television than for cinema. Therefore, Mr President, I propose that we discuss the subject of cinema seriously for once in this House. It is very important that we hold this debate. Several Members have spoken of the need to revise the directive. This process is already under way. It began this year with a wide-ranging consultation with the industry. The process will continue next year. I am sure you know that we have begun three studies on different aspects of the directive on the Audiovisual sector. We have ensured that these studies are undertaken by experts who are independent. They are therefore impartial studies, benefiting from the input of the industry and providing an objective assessment of the situation on the ground. The consultants involved have organised workshops bringing together people from the industry, from government and politicians. Members of Parliament were also invited to these workshops. Plans are afoot for further workshops. Surveys of the views of interested parties will, of course, be followed by assessment and drafting work. The findings will be brought together in a series of reports which our consultants should make available to us at the end of this year or January next year. The Commission will then begin its own consultation process with the publication of a working document, to which everyone will be invited to respond before the summer of 2002. Mr President, Parliament will therefore have plenty of opportunity to reconsider the avenues explored in Mrs Hieronymi’s report. Most importantly, Members will also be able to examine possible future directions. On the basis of the work undertaken, and depending on the results obtained, this will lead to an institutional debate on the directive and, if necessary, on the Commission’s proposals for a new directive, between now and the end of 2002. I would like to point out that I agree with Members on the need to reform the directive. It is clear that the process in which we are engaged is extremely complex. The views of Parliament will be taken into account at each stage of the process. Mrs Hieronymi’s report devotes much attention to the revision process, while also illustrating the complexity and importance of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if I may, I would like to examine two parts of the report presented to Parliament. I wish to comment on Recital H and Article 1 e). According to Recital H, the directive is now obsolete and applies only to generalist, free-to-air television, for which purpose it was originally created. This is an inaccurate assessment of the situation. The directive has a much wider scope. It applies to broadcasting in general, including subscription and thematic broadcasters, and also to digital and analogue broadcasting. The comments made in Recital H are therefore mistaken. They constitute a serious error as the directive does not apply to the Internet as the Internet did not exist when the directive was drafted. Appropriate provisions should therefore be included in the revised directive. At present, it is risky to say that the directive is obsolete for the simple reason that this could play into the hands of Member States that have not yet implemented the directive. Your rapporteur underlined this point: why implement an obsolete directive? This would result in no action being taken and no further pressure could be applied. The final outcome would be the opposite of the wishes of Parliament. This may also pose problems for candidate countries. They are currently experiencing considerable difficulties in transposing the acquis into their own legislation. I shall say more about them later. Are we going to force them to implement an acquis that Parliament considers to be obsolete? In the interests of this matter, Mr President, it is therefore extremely important to amend this part of the text. We must also ensure that we do not give a negative impression to Member States implementing the directive, or to the candidate countries transposing the acquis. Rather, we must remind them that the directive continues to provide legal certainty to European audiovisual operators. Some Members have already, quite rightly, highlighted this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Point 1) e) of the report deplores the fact that the Commission has provided insufficient information on the efforts made by the candidate countries to implement the acquis relating to the audiovisual sector, and has not stressed the need for them to increase their efforts. I would like to remind you that the report drafted according to Article 26 of the directive deals solely with the implementation of this directive by the Member States of the European Union. It does not deal with the adoption of the acquis by the candidate countries. It therefore follows that there are no details on the adoption of the acquis, or of recommendations for these countries. That said, I have some good news on this subject as the overall situation regarding the adoption of the acquis has improved since the end of 2000. All candidate countries, except for Romania, Hungary and Turkey, have provisionally closed Chapter 20 relating to the audiovisual sector. This clearly shows that the national legislation of the great majority of the countries concerned complies with the acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for always having supported me very strongly in my efforts to try to make progress to benefit our cultural industries, and also our cultural diversity. I can but say to Parliament that our work has only just begun. Revising the Television without frontiers directive will be a considerable and highly complex task in which I will continue to need the resolute support of Parliament. On the basis of past experience, I feel you will not fail me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
