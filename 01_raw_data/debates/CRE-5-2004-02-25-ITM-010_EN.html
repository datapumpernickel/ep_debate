It is, additionally, an essential requirement of any Western European-style representative democracy, a factor in eliminating inequality and an increasingly important factor for progress and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture must, therefore, constitute one of the most solid platforms supporting a Europe of the citizens. It is no longer possible, as Jean Monnet would have wished, to make culture the starting point, which could be a contentious notion at a time when we are concerned primarily with the priorities of economic intervention. We must instead pick up the baton of culture and meet the challenges set by European integration by celebrating the variety of cultures and the cultural dimension of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in a globalised society, in an enlarged Europe, in a time of various crises, faced with the new, streamlined and stimulating presence of the national identities and traditional cultures of almost 400 million citizens. In this context, politicians must give serious attention to issues of access to culture and of constructing a European worldview, an image capable of incorporating differences into its procedures, whilst ensuring that these differences are respected and valued, in a pluralistic, tolerant and dynamic way.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Members of this House to rethink and revive the role of the school in access to culture, not only in terms of the basic skills that schools can teach and of the key components in each national identity that each Member State feels should be a part of its programmes, but also in terms of Europe’s enormous cultural heritage, in its almost infinite variety of language, literature, fine art, music, theatre, tradition; in other words, everything that provides each of us with our essential mechanisms for relating to and identifying with the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Schools cannot, of course, be encyclopaedias, nor should they conform to stereotypical international standards, or merely churn out hackneyed clichés. They must offer citizens a major opportunity for access to culture and must inculcate, in everyone who attends school, from the earliest ages onwards, respect, enthusiasm and a taste for cultural expression that can help citizens to reflect on what it means to be part of Europe’s rich panoply of civilisation and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The steps that can be taken towards this end are many and varied and, as far as we are concerned, must begin with specific elements of school life. This report, in which many suggestions from members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport of every political hue were taken on board, has this very aim: to express the desire, on behalf of Parliament, that we should meet this challenge, because if we do not, European integration will make little sense and will not be worthy of the name. If citizens are armed with a knowledge of European culture, it will surely be impossible for them to remain indifferent towards the values that characterise it. It would be a contradiction in terms to comply with the Lisbon Strategy and at the same to pursue the aims of a knowledge-based economy, if culture were limited to the status of poor relative in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Graça Moura, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and above all its rapporteur, Mr Vasco Graça Moura, for a clear-sighted report which stresses the interface between schools and culture. I should like to broaden the scope of the discussion so as to include, as well as schools in the strict sense of the word, the school of life which is the family. That is where it all starts, and later it continues at school. I am very happy to see, Mr President, that as always Parliament not only supports what the Commission is doing but also adds <span class="italic">raison d’être </span>to the new ideas being developed by the Commission, thereby helping it to forge ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right in saying that we cannot build Europe solely on the basis of the economy and finance. Europe is constructed on the basis of men and women, and therefore of cultures. I agree with you in recognising that education systems ought to guarantee that, by the time they complete their secondary education, students possess the knowledge and skills which are necessary for them to prepare to assume their roles as citizens in Europe. I say ‘ought to’ because the reality is somewhat different, as we are all well aware. Even though students sometimes learn about their own regional or national roots, they are still a very long way off from learning about the roots of others, the roots of their neighbours. During a previous debate on the subject of youth, I gave you a figure. It referred to the Comenius programme, which links together schools in the European Union, so as to enable young people to participate in joint projects, thereby learning about the cultures of neighbouring countries. Well, despite the fact that two million students took part in this programme, that represents only one per cent of the population of our schools. We are therefore still a long way from achieving our aims. We are doing the right thing, but we are not doing enough, and we need to be aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our education programmes are therefore trying to respond to the desire of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture, and to the need which lies behind that desire, i.e. that our young people should learn about the real world in which they live. In this context, our cultural programmes prove to be valuable instruments for making Europeans aware of cultural diversity. Once again, however, this is not enough to reach all our citizens, or even the great majority of them. In the world of cinema, there is the MEDIA programme, which also helps to make people aware of cultural diversity through the medium of film, and which is obtaining good results. I would also ask you to remember the first major pan-European cultural event, Cinedays, the aim of which was above all to teach young people about cultural diversity through the cinema. There again, it was a good thing but it was not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to say to you that I shall need all your support in order to reinforce this aspect in the financial perspective and in the new programmes which I intend to submit to you shortly. We are already doing this, though our efforts are a mere drop in the ocean. In saying that, I am thinking about the Culture 2000 Programme and the RESEO project, which brings together the educational services of the major European opera companies with one aim in mind, to enable children and young people to discover opera through its cultural roots. I am also thinking about the CLIOH's Workshop, which is setting up cooperation between many European universities with a view to producing teaching material on European history. Yes, these things exist, but there must be a willingness at national level to make them an obligatory component of history syllabuses and of cultural education.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take this opportunity to announce that an initiative has been launched with a view to carrying out a major study to produce an inventory of best practices in bringing together culture and education in Member States, candidate countries and third countries in the European Economic Area. The next Parliament will have the results of that study at the beginning of 2005. We are not, therefore, content just to sit and complain. We are making progress, even though we know that that progress is very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graça Moura, you will understand, in these circumstances, that your report comes just at the right moment and is grist to our mill inasmuch as it gives us ideas, it supports our actions, and it points us in the right direction, which will be very useful at a time when, as you know, education and culture are increasingly regarded as major elements in the construction of European citizenship. Finally, Mr President, I should like to say a big thank you to Parliament and to its rapporteur, for this important contribution towards the future of our young citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a famous French historian might have commented, <span class="italic">'cauchemar'</span>: this is not a subject which should be treated lightly. Commissioner Reding is absolutely right that our own national governments should be encouraged to support the initiative of the rapporteur, supported by the Commission, that when it comes to programmes and projects affecting education, they might consider a certain generosity of spirit and indeed financial generosity towards the programmes that we are commonly working to support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the base of this misunderstanding is the notion that culture is purely national. Of course a part of culture is national, but as the rapporteur points out, we have many identities; we have a local and a regional identity and indeed a European identity. It is not a historical accident that the rapporteur’s country and my country, England, share the same patron saint – St George. Unhappily perhaps, this may have something to do with the fact that England and Portugal, allies of old, founded this union in battle – a crusade – in the Iberian Peninsula. Our children must of course learn about conflict and disagreement and their disastrous consequences, but they should also learn about what brings people together: commerce and trade, for example. Between England and Portugal there is the cork trade and indeed the port wine trade.</p>
<p class="contents">What role do our schools have in sharing the upbringing of the young? As Commissioner Reding has pointed out, it is not only schools – and I speak as a former teacher of young children. I was always conscious, however, that the lasting impressions had been made way before school by families; by parents and grandparents.</p>
<p class="contents">A minister of propaganda in a European dictatorship said, 'When I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver'. That sounds as if it is meant to be a flippant comment, but we know what tragic consequences dictatorship brought to human lives in so many European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that the Council of Ministers, when it next discusses these matters to which the Commission has drawn our attention, will have sufficient generosity of spirit to say that it will increase the education and culture budget – not simply in terms of finance, but in also terms of expertise, interest and political support – and that we will learn about our neighbours and about our common culture and heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Egypt, Crete, Greece, Rome and so on are of course part of England's experience, as indeed that of Portugal, Germany and everywhere else. But unless our children are given a sound basis of knowledge and understanding, then perhaps later on in life it will become harder for them to gain a successful career and sufficient financial resources. Sound knowledge, however, may bring them a little wisdom in times of difficulty. I hope that wisdom may be shared in the Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you rightly pointed out though, Commissioner, there is a large gap between the theory that we have before us and the practice in European schools. In order to close this gap, we need to be more aware that in our changing and complex times, schools play a crucial role in creating cultural openness. This does not mean that we disregard the national cultural heritage, rather it means creating a wider cultural openness in which we live together beyond the bounds of borders and without hostility having a chance even to arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back upon my own school days, I have a very clear memory of a school exchange that took place with Sweden. At that time, the war had just ended and Germany was not a popular country. The Swedes were however willing to engage in a cultural dialogue with school pupils from my country. This left a lasting mark upon me, and I think this is the right way to go about it, so, in the amendments I have tabled – and which have happily been approved – I emphasise that today more than ever before the school is a place of intercultural dialogue. In my day we did not have any Turks or Italians at school. Today however, it is quite normal for there to be a mixture of different nationalities and this represents a great opportunity for intercultural dialogue and for conveying values such as respect for others and equality in spite of differences.</p>
<p class="contents">This idea is reflected in the report and we must endeavour to see that it is implemented. These fine words must not be left to stand alone; those who are responsible for the education policy in their country must now make them their own. Commissioner, you pointed out that families have a part to play here, and this is also something that I have taken up. It is imperative for parents to work with the school and to have some personal involvement so that the overall concept finds support from everyone. And finally, I hope that this report will be approved by the majority and will eventually be transposed into policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Education can play a significant role in this and make the parents, and with them the children, aware of what culture has to offer. Europe is not only an economic project but also, above all, a cultural project; what unites us is culture and cultural diversity. Moreover, I think that it is in the interest of enlargement that the different perspectives of culture are discussed; the accession countries have a different view of our history, and there is still a long road ahead of us before we can all acknowledge and recognise what we have in common. I would like to point out, though, that education is, of course, a matter of national concern. We in Europe may be able to make recommendations and provide information about European culture, but it simply is not up to the EU to do as some of us are proposing and force the Member States to include this information in their curricula. My group will certainly distance itself from that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do share Mr Graça Moura's view that the emphasis within education should not only lie on the academic subjects, but that due consideration should also be given to creative subjects. In that respect, I should like to stand up for music education, including classical music and opera. Both boast a long tradition in Europe, but are more or less disregarded in schools.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, access to culture is important. Children who grow up in families where little is done about culture have difficulties. Ideally, parents should adopt the role of guides, but schools can also play an important role in this. I should therefore like to point out that schools should involve the parents. In that way, education in creative subjects can receive additional support, and far more interest in culture be generated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe it is vitally important to provide greater numbers of citizens with access to culture. Schools, for good reason, must play a very important role in this regard, although I must also say that I completely agree with the Commission that this is not just the responsibility of the schools. It is also the responsibility of families. It is also vital that children have the opportunity to know what surrounds them, both at local and at regional level, at national level and at European level. This is where we have to be much more involved and play a more important role.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain we often get the impression that children have little knowledge of their national culture, let alone of European culture. We all know that it is important that children identify with their city, their town, their region and their country, but it also important – without in any way undervaluing what other speakers have said – that children have some sense of identity as Europeans, and this is one of the objectives that we here must fight for. It is difficult for us to feel European if we do not know Europe, and knowing it means being aware of its history, its geography, its economy, its literature, its philosophy, and also its sports. It would be very positive if this could be a common subject in all the schools in all the Member States, and also if we could promote student exchanges more so that what they learn they learn <span class="italic">in situ</span>. We often say in my country that a picture is worth more than a thousand words.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say finally that it is essential that the educational services of museums, theatres, libraries, etc. which are available to the public, are available in more than one official language of the European Union. And if possible in several, so that we can all identify with what we are going to read.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, all of the things we are talking about tonight cannot be carried out unless there is the Community budget to do so, and this is going to be our first great battle and we must fight for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How far does it extend and in what does it consist? In his report, Mr Graça Moura deals very well with these questions. He considers the extent to which culture should be taught in schools and also at how far this should be financed and supported. These issues are, of course, mutually dependent. I think it is very important to teach culture in schools if we want young people to be aware of and confident about their identity, and capable of becoming active European citizens. We need to work on this and introduce young people to cultural exchange as early as possible. We also need to learn how to teach young people about conflict resolution, as this is something that we would expect schools to include in their lessons on culture and is a prerequisite for achieving the goals set in Lisbon which have been mentioned many times already today.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the fact that European culture and cultural history form the foundation of the common economic area and that we therefore need to invest much more in education than we are presently doing. The EU average for public expenditure on schools is 4.94% of GDP. Although in Sweden expenditure is 7% and in Austria 5.75%, these figures are both declining. It just cannot be right that in many countries, less is now being spent on education instead of more.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder what the culture ministers and government officials are thinking when they lend their support to the goals set in Lisbon and at the same time reduce the means for implementing them. This is wrong and needs to be put right. We must, therefore, continue to point out that cuts in the field of education – even in the arts – lead to very serious deficiencies. After all, if creativity is not taught and not given any room to develop, how can young people learn to deal with the constant changes that will be demanded of them in their careers and personal lives? The first step should be to increase investment in art, culture and knowledge, not reduce it. Instead of merely preserving our much-praised cultural diversity, we need to promote it and allow it to enjoy a successful future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To advocate common learning in schools at a time when nationalist arguments are increasing seems to me to be courageous and worthy of our gratitude. I say it is worthy of praise because fundamentally, although this document appears to be written with a light touch, it defends the universality of knowledge and wisdom to the hilt. We also note a degree of rebelliousness against an exaggerated interpretation of subsidiarity. We in this House argue that education for an integrated Europe does not end simply with the euro or other common economic aspects, but that it must be the result of a sense of belonging, of a common project which must be based on history, on knowing who we are, what our common foundations are and, above all, where the principles and values of our times are to be found and what the thinking behind the united Europe we are moving towards is.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe there has been an unbalanced development of the European system. Common policies have been enhanced every day, but there has been fear of making progress on the creation of common store of knowledge. Nationalisms – I repeat – with an inbred, small-minded and egotistical interpretation of the administration of knowledge and education have increased the suspicion of the creation of common information, which could be shared by all European educational establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment calling for an active policy in favour of re-evaluating our common cultural heritage. An active and lively policy which helps the weakest and creates common criteria. Likewise, I have called for there to be information signs in museums in more than one language of the Union, in several languages of the Union. I think that looking at signs in our own cities and in our own languages is a concept that must be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment calling on the Commission and the Member States to promote research projects on the great cornerstones of European civilisation, such as common law, the history of the institutions, education, forms of co-existence and common rules, social and anthropological practices, as well as artistic expressions. I believe and advocate that if we study the history of our civilisation and culture or of our institutions we will be able to rebuild foundations which existed, which exist and which unite us.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it another way: we are the result of a constant exchange of ideas, of models of life, of solutions and concepts which allow us to say that Europe has been preparing for centuries to be Europe. Europe has worked hard for a common heritage. This is why it has been so easy to build Europe. Municipal life, the concept of human dignity, of individual rights, of people’s freedom, of the family is the principal social nucleus and of municipalities as the broadest framework of rights and co-existence, solidarity, the concept of the State, they are all European concepts, as well as the concept of secularity. Furthermore, the very differences which make up what we so often call our cultural diversity demonstrate the wealth of interpretation and ways of living with a single common heritage. Let us offer young people the opportunity to know all of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main ones are the multiannual programmes, such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Culture 2000. They all encourage cultural creativity and mobility, intercultural dialogue and knowledge of the history of the European peoples. The learning of languages, something which is closely tied to cultural skills, has an important role to play in Union policy. In 2001 we celebrated the European Year of Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the rapporteur highlights the importance of knowledge of European history and cultural heritage in his report. The history of our continent is not only wars and bloodshed but also a fruitful interaction that has enriched our national cultures. We can see that many artists who have been essential to the identity of independent nation-states have at the same time been important European players.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement of the Union there will be a need to raise awareness of the culture and history of the new and the old Member States, as the report quite rightly states. I believe it will strengthen our sense of alliance, as the countries of the Baltic and Central Europe that are now joining the Union are firmly rooted in a common European cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture, education and research occupy a central position in the Commission proposal in the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013. Investment in these is crucial to success in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, but culture and education have a broader function than just economic success. They create a framework for people’s intellectual growth and mutual understanding. I therefore welcomed the report’s recommendation that the Commission and the Member States should ensure that in European research programmes encouragement is given to projects concerning the fundamentals of European civilisation such as common law, the history of institutions and education, the rules of coexistence, social and anthropological practices and forms of artistic expression.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the objectives set in the report are duly taken into consideration when the Commission is drafting new multiannual programmes relating to culture, education and youth exchange schemes. Similarly, the report contains the ingredients for negotiations among the EU Ministers for Education and Culture regarding common educational and cultural-political objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
