<p class="contents">As you well know, the current Community framework is inadequate in view of the numerous initiatives that have been set up recently at national level in this regard. This framework needs to be strengthened, particularly in order to ensure fair competition conditions between freight transporters and give greater stimulus to the balance between the individual modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to sincerely congratulate Mr Cocilovo on his excellent work. He has achieved something that, I must say, I thought impossible: grouping, bringing together, and integrating a series of amendments, presenting in the end a result that respects the principles and philosophy of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from some technical aspects, I would like to convey clearly the Commission’s support for the Parliamentary report.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I would like to point out that the draft report takes on a fundamental principle of the proposal, and this is the allocation of charging income to transport. This principle has been and continues to be the subject of arduous debates in the Council. For this reason, it is of vital importance that Parliament has supported it. How can the idea of a motorway toll be justified if we do not know what is to become of the funds it generates? In an internal market, such as we have now, how can this situation, that could send us back almost to medieval times, be justified?</p>
<p class="contents">The execution of the great projects of the Trans-European Transport Network also suffers from a lack of funds. In this respect, road charges constitute a financial impulse mechanism that must contribute to the improvement of transport links in the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the calculation of tolls, the draft report encourages the Commission to develop a method of calculating external costs. The discussions held in the Council demonstrate that, for the moment, it has not been possible to reach a compromise based on objective data and objectively determined costs. In this respect, we must continue our work and find a reliable methodology, which can be clearly accepted horizontally within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to obtain the support of Parliament for the increase of tolls in particularly sensitive areas, such as mountain regions and those affected by a high level of pollution. This last concept is completely innovative and will contribute to the creation of infrastructures that are costly but necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks in our network.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by emphasising the fact that the Commission has made an effort to offer the European Parliament a text that is acceptable to everyone; the transit countries must be capable of applying a system of charging that allows them to promote their own network within a perspective of sustainable transport development and, at the same time, the peripheral countries of the Union and their freight transporters will be the first to benefit from an effective charging policy in Europe that provides them with well-functioning networks.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we need to understand the concerns of those countries that are expecting a possible increase in transport costs and, therefore, a comparatively unfavourable situation. In order not to affect the viability of transport companies, the tolls must be fixed at reasonable levels that imply compensation for the use of an infrastructure, and therefore for the objectively calculated costs generated by the use of that infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I would have liked to have this initiative adopted at first reading and for an informal trialogue, or an informal agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission, to have allowed us to go ahead with this initiative. This has not been possible. I hope, however, that thanks to the result of Mr Cocilovo’s report, to the amendments to be introduced and to the fundamental support of this Parliament for the Commission proposal, we will soon be able to achieve a common position in the Council that is sufficiently close to Parliament’s proposal to allow, quickly, at second reading or through a quick conciliation, the adoption of this extremely important directive for the balance of transport in the European Union to be completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cocilovo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has mentioned, it is important not just, and not so much, to highlight the significance of this proposal for a directive, within the framework of developing a European strategy for transport systems, but also to mention that it is not the first time that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council itself have dealt with matters relating to the transport system and transport networks and expressed their views with specific pronouncements on them and with reference to the external costs involved in their use and the associated, problematic issue of transport infrastructure charges.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reference to Parliament’s contribution, certain points were highlighted on all of these occasions in the conclusions linked to individual reports and speeches: the need first of all to harmonise transport charges in all Member States to consolidate the single European market; the opportunity for a transformation – if not a radical one in some cases, then one that is objective and realistic at all times and, in any case, challenging – of the charging structure with a view to internalising the external costs of transport, which are often overlooked when decisions are made concerning the transport mode and, therefore, omitted from infrastructure completion strategies. Also highlighted was the need, in any case, to create a system of tariffs tallying with transport infrastructure use; the need to establish homogenous mechanisms for calculating the costs of each mode of transport and clearly comparing the Member States; and, finally, the need, to equip governments with transport policy instruments based on infrastructure costs so as to encourage the use of transport modes with less environmental impact and, above all, to allow for new investments in infrastructure and, in future, to complete the plan for fully implementing the major infrastructure projects for the trans-European transport networks that are also suffering from problems of financial cover. This was mentioned a short while ago and we are, moreover, all aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, therefore, the governments of the Member States must address two separate issues. On the one hand, there is an increasingly urgent need to invest huge resources to satisfy the demand for transport infrastructures. On the other hand, the Member States must tackle the costs – including social costs – involved in the growth of mobility, from increased air and noise pollution to environmental problems, and above all increased congestion and rising accident rates. I cannot call to mind the figures relating to this outlook, which must also be seen in the context of enlargement and of the expected increase in demand that, as always, must be met.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just an issue of external costs. We know that often the construction of infrastructures and the operation of the transport system have been funded primarily from general taxation. Today, however, the new approach to the sphere of public sector activity, the ceilings on the Member States’ budgets and policies for the privatisation of services, make it essential also to have recourse to private-sector capital to finance the construction of infrastructures, even if it means sacrificing a plan for completion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention that if this all has to take place outside of a plan – which is acceptable to no one – of detrimentally penalising road transport, it will be necessary to guarantee alternatives because the single incentive of toll charging or the measure relating to costs would not constitute an answer to the problem, in the absence of real and competitive alternatives to redirect a proportion of the volume of traffic. Instead, in terms of costs, it would exacerbate the forced use of this infrastructure and would have general economic consequences. This is why we have tried to give guidelines and find solutions to the most sensitive and difficult aspects of the problem through the cost financing instrument, and to divert an additional set of resources to accelerate the implementation of such projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by lamenting the fact that a delay on this due to internal positions in the Council will today prevent a complete result. In order to achieve one, I believe that strengthening Parliament’s position could play a major role in the future development of negotiations and, to this end, I must thank all the groups and all the Members for their valuable cooperation in the work at this stage, at least in view of the objective of bringing the first reading of the report to a positive conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it will help to improve conditions for the movement of persons and goods within the Community, it will stimulate increased competitiveness in the transport sector and it will regulate the inclusion of all external costs in the prices paid by users.</p>
<p class="contents">I am basically in agreement with these objectives, although I would have liked to see a more ambitious text in terms of harmonisation. I nevertheless consider it vital, and I emphasised this in the opinion that I drafted, that the new charges and tolls should not lead to an increase in the aggregate tax burden. For that reason, the Member States will have to revise annual road taxes and registration fees downwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have taken into consideration that the original proposal did not include any measure to allow for the specific situation of outlying countries, whose transport operators, as regards their ability to compete, will be more affected in the short to medium term than their counterparts in Member States in the centre of Europe. The approval of a new recital covering exactly this point should encourage the Commission and the Council to take this fact into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also glad that the committee, contrary to the rapporteur’s original inclinations, has not proposed the introduction of road toll fees for private motor vehicles by way of Community law, because I believe – and in this the Commission is completely right – that whether a country wishes to introduce road toll fees for private motor vehicles should be left up to that country on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Germany, there would be no reason for it, because when we consider what the driver is already paying for fuel and vehicle taxes, he is to a large extent paying for the costs of roads, indeed more than the costs of the roads would require. So we are glad that the question of toll fees for private motor vehicles is dealt with under European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we support the Commissioner in her struggle – –which is what it is – in the Council for a clear commitment of purpose, because it makes no sense to increase the road toll fees in order to improve road maintenance and expansion, if as a result the increased revenues are added to the general tax pool and go to finance no doubt very reasonable training or cultural measures or other policies. If goods vehicles are to be subject to higher toll fees the revenues from them must be returned to the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by raising two questions, and I can guarantee that we will be discussing them again in the second round. We were indeed all in agreement – even the rapporteur has referred to it – that we cannot increase the road toll fees without limit, because the increase of toll fees would lead to the death of the transport economy and the economy as a whole. We cannot just regard the goods vehicle as the cash cow of Europe. There must be limits to how far we can increase road toll fees, because otherwise we will harm jobs and economic growth. For that reason, there are two questions on which there is certainly a need for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, we generally took the view that it was possible to tax goods vehicles in favour of other transport players in the spirit of cross-finance in the Alps and the Pyrenees, because this territory, so to speak, imposed a need for particularly expensive transport facilities, for example for rail. Now, this provides a basis for permitting cross-finance in other sensitive areas also. I must warn against leaving the door open here. Speaking for my home city of Hamburg, I can say immediately that it is a sensitive area with a high volume of transport, so that we could indeed impose higher toll fees in Hamburg, Cologne and elsewhere. We must therefore think very carefully about where we will apply cross-finance as an instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue has to do with external costs; let me give you an example of what I mean. If toll fees are increased because of blockages on many sections of the Trans-European network, we would be rewarding the Member States who fail to build the necessary infrastructure. They would get more money if they do not expand. That cannot be right! So let us carefully consider these questions at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me begin by expressing my best wishes and thanks to the rapporteur. He really had his hands full with one of the most difficult and important reports in this parliamentary term, and he has done an outstanding job of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Some important comments have already been made. I would like to emphasise once again that it is a good thing that we have now formulated a uniform methodology. In this way, we can in future get rid of the mosaic of different toll systems with markedly varying charges. It is also extremely important for us that it has been possible to apply the full cost principle and to include infrastructure older than 15 years.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, another point that is close to my heart. The purpose of the Directive is not only to generate financial resources for the infrastructure, important though that indeed is. The purpose of the Directive is also to contribute to the control and management of transport, above all through levying appropriate charges. We will do this on the one hand through the differentiation of the toll and on the other through the possibility of cross-finance. In the differentiation of the toll, we will be able for the first time to allow for external costs such as ground contamination, blockage and noise costs. This represents a first step towards the comprehensive internalisation of the environmental costs, a result not to be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also endorses Amendment No 55, which deals with a further differentiation in these areas. As regards the increase of the toll for the purpose of cross-finance, the rapporteur has indeed proposed an excellent compromise. It is right that we have expanded the definition of the sensitive areas – something about which I absolutely do not agree with Mr Jarzembowski – so that the conurbations are also included in them, because that is where the most serious noise and emission problems occur.</p>
<p class="contents">We have certainly not come up with the best solution, and it would be a pity if we now only get as far as the first reading. I look forward to the further discussion in the next parliamentary term and to future debates on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sooner or later it will happen.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the parliamentary term we were idealistic about being able to apply both of them: this has not happened, we are half way there. We can say that the excellent Cocilovo report does, at least, allow us to achieve the first objective of sensibly applying the principle according to which those using the roads are charged the cost of them and this money is used to finance maintenance or further construction and, therefore, indirectly, to thus take a broad approach that, by using cross-financing, allows us to take a more comprehensive look at the corridor in which the road runs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, however, it seems to me that the Cocilovo report gives some additional guidelines. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with fixing tariffs and only maintaining this objective for some heavy vehicles and for some roads – just for transporting goods, in short – because at the end of the day something is achieved. At the same time, the report suggests guidelines as to the possibility of having different tariffs to take into account congestion and pollution and to encourage a shift to other modes of transport. From this point of view, I feel that the route chosen is positive and should be supported, including this relatively innovative concept, which is a concept upon which I believe we must carry out more work.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Health Organisation sees a clear link between particulates and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. This implies that we have a duty to intervene, including with a tariff instrument, to ensure that these problems are dealt with seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has really tried to achieve a viable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">For a sustained strategy for the Eurovignette, however, the success achieved so far is not sufficient. This is because the purpose of the Eurovignette is to achieve fairness in competition between rail and road and also to compel those who cause damage to pay for it. We think that external costs caused by transport, goods transport by road, must be attributable to it in full, and only then can fairness be achieved. Fairness in competition means that the long-term environmental damage must also be included here. Mention has been made of the sensitive areas. There too, it is obvious that not only the mountain areas, but also valleys, which have the effect of kettles and in which environmental pollution is massively intensified, and even the cities, which are already subject to strain, are all vulnerable to possible increases in the effect of traffic. Fairness in competition also means that social dumping in goods transport must be resisted. As we all know, it is only through more effective monitoring that this can be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore take the view that greater room for manoeuvre must be created in the integration of external costs into the ‘polluter pays’ principle in the area of transport for the purpose of achieving greater road safety, sustained long-term integration and above all sustained environmental protection, because we do not want the next generation to carry the cost of the damage that we are now doing with a short-term strategy for the Eurovignette. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this was not the case, but it is essentially idle to argue about this. Here and now, we have what we always supported in Austria, namely a signal for a new Pan-European transport policy which, in addition to the classic objectives of such a policy, namely traffic capacity, a favourable costs ratio and road safety, the needs of others are also considered, in particular the needs of people who reside and have to live along the European transport routes, and the requirements of the environment and the goals of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, which will, today, conclude with a result at first reading, the rapporteur, Mr Cocilovo, has achieved a great deal in an excellent collaboration with many people in this House. For this we must thank him, and also for the good deal of progress that we have made, which has produced results which should, at the end of the day, complete this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have prescribed cost-fidelity as a principle of European transport policy in general. In particular, we have also managed to get the so-called external costs integrated. We have addressed the special legal protection of sensitive areas, but also non-sensitive ones, and also sensitive times – with the emphasis on night-time traffic. We have, as is particularly important, ensured that toll revenues end up and are applied precisely where we urgently need them, namely in a combination of purpose for the transport sector and the possibility of achieving cross-finance between the individual transport players.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everything that we have achieved in this first reading in this House is sufficient in each individual case, and, for that reason, the next few months will find us having to do more work on the subject in the new parliamentary term, and we will have to endeavour, in the new Parliament, in a larger and expanded Parliament, to gain an understanding – if possible an improved understanding – for the matters of which I have spoken. We will in particular also be required to ensure that the Council is involved in our discussion and that in the foreseeable future we will have a reasonable overall result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that I am nevertheless dissatisfied will perhaps be of some assistance to him in his dealings with Mr Jarzembowski, because he stands somewhere in the middle between the various opinions predominating in this house.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take up two subjects that have already been debated today. One relates to the level of the toll and the fear of many people that excessively high toll will be levied. I believe that each country, each region will always have to consider for itself whether the toll might have adverse effects on competition, and so an upper limit will automatically be imposed here. In addition, even if there are some relatively high toll fees – such as, for example, those charged for the Brenner – thousands and thousands of drivers have not been deterred from continuing to make use of the Brenner. What this means is that, provided that the fee is not so high that it has a prohibitive effect, we have witnessed an increasing use of goods vehicles for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem, which has not been adequately resolved, has to do with the external costs. I acknowledge that the rapporteur has made suggestions here which have also been accepted by the majority of the committee and which relate to the possibility of allocating external costs, that is to say, environmental costs. The whole question turns on the need for the Commission to make proposals – which, unfortunately, it has not done. I have been a Member of this Parliament for two parliamentary terms and there has been constant discussion of this, but no concrete proposals for charging methods have ever been made. Hence also the motions which had been proposed by my party, including with my signature, for an initial statement that the Commission will make specific recommendations for charging methods within two years and, secondly, the proposal that, until that is the case, reasonable – that is to say, non-arbitrary – national charging methods can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be happy if, at least on the first point, relating to the invitation to the Commission to make proposals within two years, we could achieve consensus even today. This would greatly promote the formation of opinions and therefore also the subsequent negotiations with the Council. Nevertheless, warm thanks to the rapporteur. It is a good, but not yet satisfactory, solution that has been produced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal to charge HGVs is an improvement on the current system. It offers Member States more flexibility with regard to the kinds of systems they use. Charges can be adapted according to time of day, day, weight and EURO emission class. As a result, the charges are more flexible and more market-oriented than in the old regime, and that is progress. It is also, in my view, important that the pre-conditions for charging HGVs should be regulated at European level. There should be a system in place to stipulate how a toll is to be imposed and organised by a Member State. In this context, it is important to ensure that unnecessary new charges for heavier transport do not have a knock-on effect, which would have serious consequences for the normal logistical flow of goods, and lead to competition from the top down. We do not want to turn this into a competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that is now before us is not quite finished. I myself am pleased with Amendment No 50 tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda. I too am concerned about the ambiguity surrounding the way in which attempts are being made to internalise external costs, environmental costs, social costs and costs of accidents. This should be done on the basis of generally valid calculation methods. It is positive that the Commission will return in two years with an indication as to how we should give this substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased that any reference to passenger transport has been removed from this report. It is simply a bridge too far to make agreements at European level at this stage. That is why there is such a huge volume of passenger transport, in other words cars, and that in highly important Member States, this volume problem – car traffic to them often means local traffic – and also local charges can be tackled. However, it is, above all, important to ensure that an alternative is in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the agreement between Parliament and the Council in the Sommer report on toll systems, the comprehensive toll has for the first time been made administratively and technically possible. An agreement tomorrow on the railway package will also make possible an improvement through better harmonisation of European railways. The only thing that is not yet present is the political will for fairness, for fair competition between road and rail. Here, we have extreme differences in the working conditions. It is a scandal that the Irish Government has not even put the Markov report on the agenda. This is a matter of life and death, not just the ordinary rest and driving times on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle must also be complied with; Mr Jarzembowski, and all the others who keep saying that there are no figures, please note: accidents, EUR 19 billion; noise damage, EUR 11 billion; air pollution, EUR 62 billion; climate change, EUR 35 billion – EUR 134 billion in damage done by goods vehicles in Europe. Who pays for this? This loss is paid for by those who sit up there in the public gallery, the European man in the street, and so long as you are not prepared to pass on the costs in full and therefore also to put money in the alternatives, the shameful political fight will continue against justice on the roads of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is only reasonable that we should have common rules for the financing of roads and charges for heavy goods traffic. We cannot go it alone; the Member States cannot go it alone. The report says that we are moving towards a fair system of charging, but this morning we have been listening to what is pure demagogy, particularly in the last speech. This cannot be measured with political arguments. The European consumer will pay the price if transport systems do not function in Europe. If the EU does not function as a whole, who will pay the price? Again, it will be the European consumer who earns a thousand euros a month.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course traffic emissions will increase, because it is by far the most effective way of transporting people and goods. The road network cannot be beaten. The road network is like someone’s veins, while the railway network, with all due respect, is like someone’s skeleton, and unfortunately it has all the signs of osteoporosis. We need an efficient, cost-effective way of running a transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland recently 23 people died in just one crash involving a lorry and a bus. It is not at all the lorry that is to blame, but the fact that we are using taxpayers’ money, like in France where SNCF’s losses stand at EUR 27 billion. Consider yourselves what that means. Your money has been put into a loss-making operation, which can only account for a fraction of transport requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland is one of the richest countries in Europe. We still do not even have any motorways, though, and that is why accidents happen. We owe it to the European taxpayers that transport in Europe works rationally and efficiently; otherwise the China Syndrome will become an even greater threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is important because it concerns the most fundamental aspect of our economy, at European, national and regional level: that is to say, the efficiency of the transport system. It is also very important because it has the potential to contribute to overcoming environmental problems, crowding and noise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that the Council was concerned about competitive disadvantages, and this concern is natural, as in some areas the charges are too high, for instance in northern Scandinavia, where the distance not only to the European market but also within the region and within each country is great. A system of user charges such as this must not be instrumental in obstructing transport with the result that the economy and employment are hit.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment to Article 7 of the report states that it should be possible to set lower charges. In my opinion, it is good to have this option and, when it comes to defining this, regional-policy aspects should be included. This is because, as I said, there must be no ensuing obstruction of transport such as to hamper the economy in certain regions of Europe. I have gained a hearing for these ideas in the Cocilovo report, and for that I give my warmest thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, we are well short of the ambitions which we set out in the White Paper, and it will no doubt take us a long time to reach this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I congratulate Mr Cocilovo on the excellent work that he has done on the basis of this ‘Eurovignette’ Directive, but the basic limitation of this is that it is not a European charging policy, but a regulatory framework for national charging policies. There are, therefore, bound to be differences between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless essential to support the guidelines adopted by the Cocilovo report in favour of internalisation of external costs, of cross-financing being extended to all corridors and of its extension to all road networks and not only to trans-European networks, which could give rise to transfers or shifting of traffic. If this is not the case, we shall vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A radical transformation is needed in the charging structures with a view to internalising social and environmental costs of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Greenhouse gas emissions are mainly attributable to road transport. Although that is a well-known fact, it was still difficult to make others see that this is not about pestering lorries. According to some texts, there is a dramatic increase in traffic, and along with this, a dramatic increase in the emission of greenhouse gases. This is a tragedy, and it simply has to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">I should briefly like to bring to your attention Amendment No 24 from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It looks like a new committee is being created. I hope that this committee, when it is up and running in a couple of years' time, will duly seek advice from the NGOs in the field of protecting personal privacy and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
