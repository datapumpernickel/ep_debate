<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are going to debate now naturally relates to other types of activity and actions, although it also relates to energy. We are talking about the proposals relating to the security of supply of oil-based products and the supply of natural gas.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal simply represents an extension of the Green Paper, and its objective is to try to move on from words to actions. The proposal on oil is intended to provide the European Union with the means to act in a united and credible fashion, without difficulties in the supply of oil, in such a way that certain situations which may upset the economy, society and the functioning of the market can be resolved in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the European Union to be able to act effectively in these circumstances we must meet three requirements. Firstly, we must establish a genuine Community decision-making process with regard to the use of security reserves, particularly in crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an appropriate definition of those circumstances which may lead to the release of security reserves of oil. The legislation in force, both national and Community, is still often based on the idea that security reserves are an instrument which is only used when the shortage of oil is serious. In this regard, I am happy with the development which has taken place within the International Energy Agency, with regard to the possibility of taking account of the definite risks of breaks in supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">The third requirement consists of creating credible and visible security reserves of quality. In many States, security reserves are the property of oil companies and are not differentiated from their existing operative stocks. So at the moment we do not know exactly how much reserve we have. Furthermore, we have an accounting system which, as the honourable Members know, differs, for example, from the accounting system for reserves of the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to gas, the Directive is aimed, in a nutshell, at guaranteeing a daily and operative security of supply within a competitive environment. It creates a security network for long-term supply contracts and increases Community solidarity in the event of very exceptional crisis situations which could not be resolved successfully at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">The second Directive on the internal market in gas will complete the creation of a single European market in natural gas, and will mean that all customers, including homes and small commercial enterprises, may chose their provider.</p>
<p class="contents">It is expected to promote competition in the supply of gas. And the large industrial consumers will be able to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee security of supply, but not homes or small commercial enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">For these customers, security of supply is not a market issue and does not influence their choice of provider. Therefore, it should be reconfirmed to all gas consumers in the internal market that security of supply is adequately guaranteed, regardless of the provider they have chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is considered necessary because greater competition could encourage gas companies to reduce their current levels of security of supply in order to reduce costs and increase their competitiveness. This is what the Commission wishes to prevent, and it has therefore proposed that the current rules on security of supply, which until now are usually maintained on a voluntary basis, should become binding. We are therefore clearly talking about a consumer protection measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the European Parliament to take these considerations into account. They clearly demonstrate the contribution of the Commission’s proposal to the good functioning of the internal gas market, as well as the importance of security of supply in a market of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Other elements of the Commission’s proposal relate to long-term aspects of the security of supply despite the fact that the Commission does not have the least doubt that the market will provide an adequate number of long-term contracts; it is extremely important to communicate, both to investors and to producers, that the European Union recognises the importance of those contracts and that, in the very unlikely event that any problem should arise, will act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted to hear that the European Parliament accepts in principle a mechanism for Community solidarity in the event of an extraordinary crisis in the European Union’s gas supply and it goes without saying that in such an event, if national measures are not sufficient to deal with the situation, the Community must be able to resolve the problem in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with these two proposals, the first relating to oil stocks, which seeks to bring the reality of the systems operating within the context of the European Energy Agency into line with the functioning of the European Union’s internal market, and the second relating to security of supply in the field of gas, where our intention is to implement mechanisms which until now have only been more or less voluntary and also bring them into line with the reality of an open and integrated market within the European Union, I believe that the Union will have greater security of supply and if necessary will be able to face situations of tension or crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Security of supply in the natural gas sector can certainly be an issue for the European Union, which, taken as a whole, is dependent on imports for some 75% of its natural gas, although – unlike with oil – there is no suppliers’ cartel. I might add that the supplier countries are themselves dependent on exports to the EU, as natural gas is of any value only if it is transported and sold. On the other hand, the countries supplying us are Russia, Algeria, Libya, and the countries around the Caspian Sea, the stability of which is a matter of concern to the EU. It is regrettable that the Commission does not discuss all this in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What is behind the proposal instead is, in essence, interruptions in supplies to the EU market. I regret having to say, Madam Vice-President, on behalf of the lead Committee, that the proposal, as it stands, has found no supporters in this House, and that some of us reject it outright. That is not the position taken by the main Committee, which proposes that the plenary should send a message to the Commission, the Council, the participants in the market and also to the supplying and producing countries by dealing with the issue in a new and different way, turning the proposal upside down and – let me say this with particular clarity – refraining from creating a category of <span class="italic">dirigiste</span> European actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is about three things: one is not seeing management so much as being primarily about holding and administering reserve stocks, that is, deterring investors from doing what they are actually meant to do and emphasising the responsibility of state agencies, but rather doing the precise opposite by encouraging businesses to invest, by emphasising the role they play and taking into account the fact that they already do a great deal towards securing supply; the ways in which they do this are various, including the diversification of sources of supply, international pipelines and storage tanks, long-term supply contracts and the like. Above all, the Commission proposal fails to engage at a fundamental level with the fact that supply as a whole does indeed have a price. Parliament cannot approve the handing over to the European level – represented by the Commission – of instruments that suspend the market price, prevent markets from signalling prices and shortages and make no reference to the prices obtaining in the system of supply as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The second essential approach should involve addressing the responsibilities of the Member States, which have done, and are able to do, a great deal in this area. I must at this juncture, Madam Vice-President, make the straightforward point that as recently as 1998 – which is only a couple of years ago – the Commission shared the general consensus that what the Member States do in this area was quite sufficient. That was, indeed, stated quite officially by the Energy Council. In this, the different actual conditions in the Member States also have to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that, at EU level, it could then be our task to create a framework for obligations on enterprises, with which we could equip the Member States, so that these in turn could impose this as an obligation on their own enterprises. At European Union level, provision could also be made to empower the Member States in crisis situations, conditional upon business not being able to respond itself, or else not in good time. Only in extreme cases and grave crisis situations could European law oblige the Member States to take specific measures – I emphasise that it would be European law that would oblige them to act. I hope I have not misunderstood what you have just said, but we emphatically repudiate your suggestion that the European level should intervene directly in the government of the Member States, of which there will soon be twenty-five; it cannot do that. That Parliament must not under any circumstances approve such a thing was the unanimous opinion of all the committees that have considered this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must take charge of the environmental dimension and security of supply, develop new, and above all renewable, energy sources and use the energy we have more wisely and efficiently etc. Oil too is part of the overall issue, including the security of oil supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Does Europe need common rules governing oil supplies, together with increased coordination? That is how the debate on the proposal for a directive on security of supply for oil in Europe might briefly be formulated. For most people, the answer is no doubt obvious. Clearly, it is good for us to have more solidarity in Europe, including where energy supplies are concerned, but, at the same time, we are entering areas in which the Member States believe that each country must have sovereignty in determining the level of common commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">My report makes an attempt to balance these conflicting requirements. Most people agree that it is necessary to bring about better coordination of energy supplies in Europe but, at the same time, the Member States want, to a large extent, to maintain control. That is especially clear when it comes to oil supplies. My report changes a number of points in the proposal for a directive. Through a range of amendments, I have tried to find that balance between the Member States and the common interest that is required if we are to achieve a solution that can work well for the oil market and in terms of the needs of the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for increasing oil suppliers’ readiness to build up larger reserves – for 120 rather than 90 days – may appear sound, but also contain disadvantages. It costs a fair amount to increase the reserves, and both transport and storage affect the environment. I therefore choose to retain the present commitment involving 90 days. The proposal for enabling oil reserves to be released, even if there is no physical shortage, may appear sound at first glance, but it is clear, where this too is concerned, that such an arrangement would entail large problems and risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is not always right. That is something we have seen for ourselves in many oil crises, as they are termed. At the same time, it is incredibly difficult to develop regulations and agree upon clear and objective criteria that apply in all the various situations we can imagine ending up in when oil prices rise quickly. I therefore reject the Commission’s proposal to facilitate the release of oil reserves, even where there is no physical shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is based upon the need for increased coordination and the sharing of responsibility for oil supplies within the EU. This requires changes to the present regulations, without impairing the arrangement that currently prevails whereby countries outside the EU and Europe also participate. Existing structures and commitments must apply in the future too, but coordination must be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has adopted a number of amendments that balance Community and national interests. The majority of my own amendments – the most significant – were adopted. Some of my amendments were rejected. I choose to reintroduce only one of the amendments rejected by the committee. This is about the way in which responsibility for security stocks is organised. The Commission wants a public body to be given this task. At present, the arrangements are different from one Member State to another. Nor do I see any reason why, in the future too, they should not be different. My amendment is aimed at giving the Member States the opportunity to choose the methods they consider best suit their own countries, without attendant disadvantages for other Member States. In Amendment No 28, I therefore propose that it should be up to the Member States to choose whether it should be a public body that has the task in question or whether it is for the individual Member State to opt for another arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">Two amendments suggest that the proposal for a directive be rejected. This is because the proposers believe that proper regulations already exist and that no changes are needed. There are quite a few reasons for objecting to this. First of all, it has in many ways been shown that there are defects in the present regulations when it comes both to coordination within the EU and to the sharing of responsibility in a crisis situation. Secondly – and this is something I think MEPs should reflect upon – rejection would probably mean our depriving ourselves of the opportunity of exercising influence over this important area. That is something I think worth noting.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if Parliament were to adopt this report on the proposal for a directive, including the proposed changes, we should, as a result, also have to cancel a number of previous directives, namely directives 68/414/EEC, 98/93/EC and 73/238/EEC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in our society have become dependent on the supply of oil and gas, products supplied to a large group of consumers by a small group of producers. It goes without saying that when major interests are at stake in the supply of energy, the proposals must also be well considered. This is exactly where the problem lies in the Commission proposal on the security of natural gas supply.</p>
<p class="contents">The first problem is the proposal’s legal basis. The Commission takes Article 95 on the internal market as its basis. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has specifically recommended having the legal basis examined. I am not aware of anything having resulted from this.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem is that there is no need for this proposal. Parliament has recently discussed, at second reading, the gas directive, which deals with security of supply. The Commission proposal is not consistent with this; quite the contrary, in fact – it even appears to contradict this gas directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, partly as a result of this, the Commission proposal is ambiguous and leaves many questions unanswered. Apparently, these questions must be answered in the implementation phase, and this is not the purpose of a directive. A directive aims to provide direction and offer a solution. The Commission proposal, however, raises more questions than it can answer. Particularly in Articles 3 and 4, the wording is unclear and can be interpreted in more than one way.</p>
<p class="contents">These objections lead the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to recommend unanimously that the proposal be rejected, and in line with this recommendation, I have tabled an amendment for consideration by plenary. On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I suggest that the proposal be sent back to the Commission. I thank you for your attention and count on your support for the amendment to reject the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we stick with our policy of burning crude oil in an uncontrolled way, this dependency will increase to 95% by 2020. If we were to draft a treatise on the risks and dangers of such dependency and on it effects on the economy and the environment, such a treatise would run to thousands of pages.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems likely that we will shortly reach the limits of the world’s capacity for supplying oil. The various prognoses by partisan institutes that essentially exist to do work commissioned by the crude oil interests should be regarded with the greatest suspicion. What is beyond doubt is that the overall availability of crude oil has decreased worldwide since the year 2000. The fact that we in the EU are starting to think in terms of solidarity and about security of supply is therefore something to be welcomed as a matter of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem needs, though, to be seen in the medium and long term context; it will not be capable of being solved without the development of alternative fuels and alternative propulsion technologies, or without changes in our overall patterns of mobility. The EU must develop independent technologies to exploit bio-energy fuels derived from renewable primary energy sources, and, at the same time, make full use of the potential for 18% savings in energy. This is where it would, without doubt, make sense to make the optional goals binding.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment following up the idea of the crude oil price being fixed in euros in future is a very interesting one, but there will have to be some serious thinking about what that means in terms of global politics and economics in general. I think it likely that it will not be an easy route to take.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s consumption of natural gas is also increasing steeply. If crude oil becomes a scarce resource, that is to say, if it is no longer present in sufficient quantity, the demand for natural gas will increase by even greater leaps and bounds, but those who believe that natural gas can simply replace crude oil as a resource are in a state of perilous error. We cannot solve our energy problems by changing from oil to gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent years have, however, seen great progress in the development of renewable biogas. The essential fact is that we have not yet sufficiently registered this. As the technologies are comparatively new – indeed, for that precise reason – they need massive support from the EU’s research funds. Biogas is a storable and renewable energy source and hence of especial strategic usefulness and value. Biogas can be extracted on a local and decentralised basis from biogenous materials such as grass, biological waste, and wood. Today, we take relatively low prices for gas and oil for granted, but I believe that, now that shortages are becoming apparent – and oil and gas prices have trebled in recent years – locally-produced renewable energy sources will become a much more competitive proposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to security of supply. In terms of the way things hang together generally, I believe that the question as to whether the EU should require security stocks of 90 or 120 days’ worth of crude oil is a relatively insignificant one. The argument that cost considerations militate against keeping sufficient security stocks for 120 days is one that we could certainly discuss. Quite apart from that, however, it strikes me as illusory to believe – a belief expressed by the Commission in its proposal – that increasing security stocks from 90 to 120 days’ worth will help enable us to pursue a proactive crude oil price policy. If there were to be a real shortage of crude oil, even 120 days’ worth of it would bring only minimal relief. Here, too, it has to be stressed that we have to set out how – on the one hand – we are going to reduce overall consumption of crude oil and natural gas and, on the other hand, to push through the production of substitutes on a sustainable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate something of which I am profoundly convinced, and which has manifested itself in the last few years, that the price of energy can change dramatically over the coming years as a consequence of decreased availability and of the increasing instability in the crude oil-producing countries. We see this now in the Middle East, we can see it happening in Central Asia, which is a potential trouble spot, and we see it in Africa too. I therefore basically welcome all three positions as provoking thought – an expression that has, I believe, already been used by those on the other side. For thought-provoking is what each of them is – whether in the right or wrong way I consider less than crucial – and from them we must develop a long-term energy strategy for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not share Commissioner De Palacio’s optimistic view that her proposal will enjoy the support of a broad majority in this House. It will not! Not only the committee’s hearings with experts – over which we took a great deal of trouble – but also the debate with Commission officials and our own reflections have led us to the conclusion that these two proposals from the Commission may well have the right objectives in mind, but the means will not command majority backing. There is no dispute about the great extent to which we are dependent on imports of crude oil; that much is obvious. This is not, though, about the Commission acquiring additional competences in order to influence prices and perhaps retain its own capacity for intervention. We take the view that, although there is a need for more solidarity between the Member States and the Commission can certainly do more as regards coordination, the use of Article 95 on the internal market to justify additional competences for the Commission in relation to petroleum products is not appropriate. We have therefore considered at length what we should do about this. The committee was divided on whether we should reject the whole proposal or accept it as modified by the amendments submitted by Mr Karlsson. A single-vote majority on the crucial issue of sending this proposal back does not make for a broad basis, and our group – that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – has discussed what we should do with this proposal; our group took the view that at least the directive on crude oil should be sent back. This would give the Commission the chance to take on board the arguments adduced by Parliament in the Committee debates, whilst directing it, in unambiguous terms, to thoroughly revise the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussions with the experts, I listened very carefully to the arguments against increasing the reserves from 90 to 120 days, which made clear not only the relatively high cost involved, but also expressed a desire for the reserves to be, in future, provided by the Member States and no longer in collaboration with the oil industry. I am, for my part, convinced that the proposal for the reserves to be used to influence prices when these change in certain ways does not indicate extensive knowledge of the market realities; such a scheme would fizzle out, cost a great deal of money, and be ineffective. On the other hand, we are sure that, whilst the International Energy Agency, whose instruments were fashioned in the 1970s, is unable to make full use of the opportunities presented to it today, the strategic reserve, along with what the USA does to increase it, combined with the International Energy Agency’s instruments, would provide quite adequate help when conflicts occur. We therefore reject the idea of additional competences at EU level and hope that a majority in this House will back us in doing so. Your speech, Commissioner – whatever my undisputed regard for you – did not make it apparent that the Commission has started to do any thinking since the debate in this House and the hearings of the experts. I got the impression that it was as if we were only at the beginning of the debate. As regards your objectives, we are right behind you, but we do believe that it is the Member States rather than the Commission to whom responsibility and resources should be given. Although your role is to coordinate the action they take, this must not be on the basis of a new kind of competence to which – according to the articles on the Internal Market – you are not entitled. This leads me to believe that your proposal must be sent back, thus giving you the chance to present a new and revised one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rapkay (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, in my contribution to this debate, I want to concentrate on the subject of the gas supply directive, as Mr Karlsson, the rapporteur on crude oil, has had his group’s agreement when dealing with this topic. I do not therefore think that there is anything further to be added to what he had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner De Palacio, you threw into the scales a very weighty argument in favour of the directive: the protection of the consumer and of security of supply. Faced with so substantial an argument, one is almost inclined to shrink back and deny that any criticism of this directive was intended. After all, who would object to the consumer being protected or to the security of the energy supply? The question does not even arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the impression, though, that this is where the Commission has chosen the wrong track. I have to tell you, Commissioner, that I believe that we achieved a good result when we worked together on the directives for streamlining electricity and gas, but I think that we have less common ground on this one. I want quite explicitly to refer back to what the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, has told us. I can agree with it almost without reservation. I think that the reason why you chose the wrong track was that security of supply simply cannot be defined and organised supranationally. Security of supply has to be adapted, on a regional basis and dynamically, to incessant fluctuations in demand, which increases and diminishes. The differing framework conditions existing in the Member States call for individually-tailored measures on the part of the Member States themselves and of the supply companies involved. What is decisive is not the imposition of a single European standard, but flexible use of the infrastructure, diversity of sources, and the way contracts are framed.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find particularly disturbing, though, is the false political message that I believe this draft directive is sending out. What, then, is the actual occasion for a directive of this kind? Unlike with oil, there have been to date no major crises in the supply of natural gas, nor is there any cause for concern that one is to be expected in the foreseeable future. As has already been said, it was only a few weeks ago that we adopted, with a great deal of consensus, the directive on the internal market in natural gas. There were those who said that, by opening up the market, we were jeopardising the security of energy supply; are we not now proving that they were right? Why do we not let the opening up of the market do its work? It is itself a contribution to the security of supply and directly involves enterprises in sharing responsibility for it.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me that the draft put before us undermines the elements in the internal market directive that deal with competition. I include myself among those who took the view that the draft directive should be sent back. Now, for tactical reasons, I recommend another course of action. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we had a discussion with Mr Blokland, and came to a broad agreement. All I fear, ladies and gentlemen, is that the Council is not entirely to be relied on, in that members of it are always signalling that they do not want the directive the way it is, but we never get any firm statement to that effect. For that reason, I fear that, if we now send the directive back and the Council nonetheless adopts a Common Position – which it can of course do – we will be pretty defenceless when it comes to Second Reading. That is why I recommend that we should take the approach to the gas supply directive suggested by the rapporteur, and which, after all, we agreed on with an overwhelming consensus in committee. Then we will see what further progress we can make at Second Reading stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, we succeeded, in June, in adopting legislation not only facilitating the further liberalisation of the energy market but also safeguarding the security of energy supply. If this new directive is implemented properly and enforced consistently, Europe can avoid situations of the kind experienced in California. According to the new legislation, it is the Member States that are required to offer security of supply. This is why, according to the ELDR, the current gas market proposals go way too far. After all, the subsidiarity principle applies at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this applies all the more to the supply of oil. Consequently, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would call for the Commission proposal on oil supply to be rejected and returned to the Commission. We have a number of reasons to substantiate this view.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation already in force is adequate to safeguard security of supply. Directive 98 requires Member States to maintain a stock level of 90 consumption days. The Commission would like to increase this obligation, but fails to make it clear why a higher stock level is necessary. The Commission has failed to explain the expected benefits derived from a higher stock level, let alone how it can justify the expected costs for the Member States. It is unacceptable for this Parliament to issue legislation for which any basis is lacking, while current legislation is sufficient and as long as there is no proof demonstrating the need for new legislation. This is something that we in this House must emphatically reject. I would therefore urge you to support the ELDR Group’s position and thwart this superfluous legislation. I am given to understand that people from different political quarters in this Parliament are adopting the same reasoning. I think that we will be able to reach an agreement during the vote tomorrow. I would thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work and I thank you all for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reserves in relatively nearby areas – the North Sea and North Africa – are only sufficient to meet needs for the next 10 or 20 years, and gas will have to be imported from the east.</p>
<p class="contents">The route of the gas pipeline from the Caspian Sea area to Western Europe is a matter of power politics. The EU’s position must not be too NATO-dependent concerning this. We have, above all, to safeguard our own interests. We have to remember that the world’s largest gas reserves are in Russia. The best security policy will be for the EU to participate in investment in Russia’s gas resources in exchange for long-term supply contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Connected with the problems of liberalising the gas market is the fact that gas market actors are only interested in buying and selling gas, but not in producing gas for investment. The market runs on too short a time scale, and that is why measures need to be taken by the Member States to guarantee long-term supply contracts. There are no such contracts being made in the markets. Gas cannot be stored in the same way as oil. For that reason modes of transportation and the needs of secure storage with respect to oil and gas differ from one another. Responsibility for the security of supply of both oil and gas lies with the Member States, and this responsibility cannot be transferred to market forces.</p>

Indeed, in this respect, the Commission proposes a number of measures that guarantee a continuous supply of natural gas, but one is right in questioning, as many of my fellow MEPs have done before me, whether the intended goal can be achieved with these measures. I do not, in any event, support the most essential measures from the Commission proposal, which I will list below.</p>
<p class="contents">The first measure concerns the increase of the level of stocks from 90 to 120 days. Why would the European Union increase its stocks when the International Energy Agency has a global emergency response mechanism at its disposal? Furthermore, the increase in stocks entails considerable expenses, including the construction of storage facilities. Needless to say, this would also result in a huge burden on the environment, and costs would undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission wants to set up a public body for sustaining natural oil supplies. This body would be responsible for at least two thirds of the required stock levels. It would, in my view, take more than setting up a new body. It appears paramount to me that a sound political relationship should be established with the natural oil producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal also seeks to use market intervention to curb price fluctuations, so that the Commission would henceforth be able to release stocks in the case of expected physical interruptions in supply. This, to my mind, serves no purpose whatsoever. When you know that even the OPEC countries do not manage to maintain the desired price level, this measure can only be described as wishful thinking on the part of the European Union.</p>

Despite this, it seems more helpful to me to withdraw the proposal.

I share the Commissioner's concern over the need for security of supply for oil and gas in Europe, but we might have different ideas as to how we can achieve it - in particular, not by interventionism in the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Commissioner seeking to reinvent the wheel when there are already satisfactory arrangements in place with the IEA for a regime of maintaining oil reserves? It was established in the 1970's in response to the crisis then and it has served us in good stead ever since, so why replace it?</p>
<p class="contents">I have even more concern about and difficulty with proposals to use reserves to intervene in the market for purposes of price-smoothing, when experience shows – and recent experience in the United States in particular shows – that it does not work. It would be a distortion of a market that has worked well for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are to be commended for the many initiatives on energy that you have introduced over the last four years, not least for the Green Paper on security of supply, for which I was Parliament's rapporteur. However, the different measures you have brought forward – on liberalising gas and electricity markets, on promoting renewables, on increasing energy efficiency and on developing trans-European energy networks – make clear to me that there is no need to create a additional chapter or legal base on energy, because you have all these instruments available to you already.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is an unnecessary measure. With particular reference to the proposal on oil reserves, although I bow to my colleague's views about the measure on gas being in a different category, I make no apology for reintroducing the amendment to reject this proposal and in doing so I thank all those colleagues who supported me on this specific aspect. I hope you will take this in the spirit in which it is intended and reflect on different ways of achieving the objective that we share: maintaining security of supply for energy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, should we win the vote on this amendment – and as my colleague indicated, it was very close in committee – I trust that the Council and the Commission would respect the outcome and not carry out the threat made in committee by the Commissioner's services to go for a different procedure, in effect acting behind Parliament's back in seeking to persuade the Council to do something which, so I understand, it does not want to do anyway. So I urge you to pause and think again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, I called for the reserves to be increased in order to be on the safe side in the event of supplies being interrupted. That sounds like a plausible thing to do, and that, in any case, was the policy we introduced in 1974. I have, however, learned in the meantime that any benefit from this bears no relation to the cost involved, and the United States’ experience with its Strategic Petroleum Reserve demonstrates that emptying the reserves has remarkably little effect on steeply rising prices. That should give us pause for thought.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that costs are running high and the benefit to us is relatively small, so I would like to say that I agree with my fellow-Members that this is perhaps not the right road to take. Perhaps we would have something different to say if supplies really had been interrupted; we would probably be in a state of shock and attacking the Commission, asking why it had not responded to a crisis situation of this kind. The only thing is that I see such a situation as highly unlikely. It is far more probable that the greatest risk is the economic one set out by the Commission itself in its proposal, that of prices rising, probably creeping upwards. That is what our main problem will be with gas over the next ten or twenty years. The end result of Europe’s increasing dependency on gas will be a slow rise in prices, which we will be completely unable to influence unless, in twenty years’ time, we have managed to persuade the Russians to be nice to us and reduce them. That will be the real problem. Dealing with it will require, not a directive such as this one, but dialogue with Russia and also with OPEC. That is what the Commission has already made a start on, and that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with an observation on the networks. If we extend the networks, as we plan to do, the effect of this will be similar to that of maintaining reserves, as networks – the ones for gas, at any rate – are a sort of reserve, and extending them produces the same effect. That, thank God is a point on which we can agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments to directives have improved some, if I may say so, rather poor proposals by the Commission. The amendments adopted by the committee, however, do not as yet go far enough, as has been said here in a good number of speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for maintaining security of energy supply lies mainly with national energy policy. To improve security of supply we also have to conclude agreements with other countries. Member States must be able to decide freely on the organisation of security stocks. Some Member States of the Union have abandoned the use of public stockholding bodies. They have succeeded in organising matters efficiently and cost-effectively by other means. That is why Member States should be able to determine and decide when it is permissible to site oil stocks in another Member State without jeopardising security of supply. Siting security stocks abroad must, however, be carried out on the basis of contracts between the countries and in compliance with current practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The special circumstances obtaining in each Member State have to be taken into account to ensure supplies of energy. To improve security of supply it is also important to ensure that there is a diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of energy providers. I also wish to remind everyone that promoting the use of local renewable energy increases security of supply, reduces dependence on imports of energy and also creates employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fate of the Alstom Group’s 120 000 employees can no more be guaranteed by free competition than the future of energy and its independence – and thus Europe’s political independence – can be by simply enforcing the rules and principles of the free market. Even in the happy home of liberalisation – I am referring to the United States of America – they know this and they know how to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, unlike the vast majority, if not all, of my colleagues, I personally welcome the endeavours of the Commission to retrain its sights in this area. I am in favour of larger gas and oil reserves which, in the event of serious shortage, could prevent potential recourse to war in a world in which, as we know, the control of energy is often the primary cause of war.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards management, I am also in favour of greater solidarity between States during shortages, under the auspices of the European Commission, in order to avoid political tensions or even conflicts between Member States where those that are best provided for are able to impose their choices on others.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area where, for me, legitimate respect for the powers of the Member States and the need for the European Commission to be given greater authority are not contradictory. We therefore need to follow you, Madam President, if only - as Mr Linkohr has just said - to avoid you or the Commission one day being criticised for having done nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Try to imagine, if you will, that you have to argue the case for what you are setting before us here in an election – one in which your own future is at stake. What arguments would you use? A new authority, even more security in someone’s hands in such a way that you can not see where things are leading, and withdrawal to a central location? In this election, your fellow-candidates would be those to whom you have been listening – Mr Beysen, Mr Langen, Mr Kronberger, Mr Rapkay, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, and Mr Linkohr – and the only person who would vote for you would be none other than Mr Caudron.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were to do that, would anyone be aware of what your fundamental political convictions actually are? I have been in this House for four years, but a proposal for enforced blessings the like of which you have come up with is new to me; I have seen it only in another Union, one that imploded on itself not least because it demanded that sort of thing. I think that what you are working towards is the meeting of a need for what Socialists and Communists used to call security ‘from the cradle to the grave’, but by the wrong means, and the way this constantly comes across in speeches in debate suggests to our minds that this security is a false one. I think we really have to go in another direction. One cannot evade the impression that this is a Commission that is slowly running out of ideas on energy, which again has to have recourse to directives on the subject; energy should take you where we really have to go. How do we leave behind us fossil fuels and dependency on them, and achieve transparency? If I am actually to leave security of supply in the hands of the regions and of enterprises, then this has to be clearly documented and the citizens and consumers concerned have to know how it is to be secured.

The particular issue of oil and natural gas reserves which we are examining here cannot resolve the overall problem, especially when it is addressed within the framework of the liberalisation of the market, rather than with the satisfaction of grass-roots needs as the criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue in the new directive is not whether compulsory reserves will be for three or four months, but the fact that controls of reserves and regulatory competence are being shifted from the Member States to the European Commission. If this is accepted, it will undermine still further the facility for energy planning based on the needs of each Member State and will result in an energy sector structured in accordance with the choices of the strong powers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece believes that every country should take measures to reduce energy dependency, make full use of domestic sources and develop and exploit new forms of energy, with the objective of securing cheap supplies for the working classes and protecting the environment.

However, I believe that this debate on energy security has never been so important. We need only look at the recent power cuts on the east coast of America to see how an energy crisis impacts on ordinary people - no power, no lights in family homes, no refrigeration, millions of dollars lost by small businesses. This incident was merely the result of a technical or human error that was rectified very quickly, but it has been a much needed wake-up call to those of us who too often take our energy supply for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently the Institution of Civil Engineers said that the UK could face power cuts in 20 years' time because of its dependency on foreign energy sources. It has also estimated that in the UK alone – even given centres of excellence around the North Sea such as the European energy capital of Aberdeen – 80% of the gas needed to fuel British power stations will come from distant and politically unstable countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Member States certainly have responsibilities for securing their own energy supplies, the need for cooperation early in a crisis situation will be vital. However, judging by the debate this evening, opinion is certainly divided. Safeguarding supply is paramount, but how do we reassure the public that we have security of supply?</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been achieved in the energy agenda in the EU, and liberalisation, at any rate in the UK, has allowed for consumers to have choice and hence cheaper gas and electricity, but, as Mr Linkohr has suggested, if gas prices increase in the near future, consumers will be very unhappy.</p>
<p class="contents">New threats from terrorism and sabotage – as we have seen in Iraq – and our increasing dependence on energy from outside the EU pose huge challenges. As Mr Mitchell, from the UK's Royal Institute of International Affairs has stated, the key to energy security lies in diversity of supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the Member States must contain a level of oil stocks equivalent to 90 days' consumption for each of the three main categories of petroleum products for energy use.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us today is intended to replace existing European Union directives which govern this important energy policy matter. Indeed, such a directive is needed because the current European Union legislation does not provide for a Community mechanism governing the use of oil stocks. We live in an internal market and there must be solidarity between the Member States and the European Union in the event of energy supply problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In most countries of the Union – by way of contrast with the strategic petroleum reserve in America – security stocks are held by oil companies and are mixed with their operational stocks. The main feature of the Commission proposal is to ensure that Member States set a minimum level of oil stocks for a period of 120 days. The Members States of the Union must set up a public oil holding body and there must be harmonisation and coordination of crisis measures at European level. The Commission will be assisted in its work by a committee made up of representatives of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 May 2004 we will be living in a Community of up to 25 Member States. Adequate provision of oil and gas is necessary if the European Union economy is to operate effectively. There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is a role for the Commission in dealing with this sensitive issue and that this energy matter is best coordinated at European Union level in the interests of European industry and the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Linkohr said a moment ago, it is very possible that if there had been any really serious problem with a break in supply we would not be having a discussion like the one we are having now. Because all the problems which this proposal is intended to prevent would have been confronted and we would have had ways to respond to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that, as I see the issues developing, the proposal will probably be rejected tomorrow, at least one of them, and all I can say to the honourable Members is that I am not going to use the back door. Some of you have expressed concern that I might go against this House’s rejection, and make some complicated and tortuous deal with the Council. No, if I do not have the support of this House, I will promote other types of initiative and I simply hope that the time never comes for me to say, ‘I told you so’, because that would mean amongst other things that we do not have any really serious crisis in the energy sector. That is my intention, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are two or three things that I would like to clear up, because I have heard several questions which do not really correspond to the texts which I have proposed. Firstly, the proposal on oil stocks is not intended to play with prices or intervene in them. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about something very different, that the European Energy Agency has modified its recent decisions and has adjusted its previous criteria, according to which oil stocks could only be used when there was a break in the market, specifically of around 6 or 7%.</p>
<p class="contents">And in the face of this previous rigid position, there has been a development towards providing for the possibility of using stocks in view of the certainty of a break, without this actually having arisen. Because when there is a break in supply and there is a 7% shortage in the market, we have a major problem. And this development, which is one of the aims of the Commission’s initiative, ladies and gentlemen, has been taken up recently by the International Energy Agency. It is not therefore a question of playing with prices, and if there is any phrase which remotely gives that impression, that phrase of course should not be maintained, but it should be changed and we would make it extremely clear, because nobody intends to play with prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second issue, it is not a question of giving the Commission more competencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of having mechanisms which allow us to overcome the situation in the event of crisis. One of you asked me: if you had to explain to your voters what the justification for this proposal is, how would you do so? Well, I will explain it very simply: let us imagine that there is an oil crisis and the International Energy Agency says ‘let us use the mechanisms’. Well, ladies and gentlemen, there are two types of mechanism: mechanisms for managing the market and mechanisms for using stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The States within the International Energy Agency can choose one system or another. And this is all very well while there is no totally integrated market as in the case of the European Union. Because the fact that a country of the European Union, one of the large ones, suddenly chooses an option which is radically different from that of its neighbour, which is perhaps not so big, is going, automatically to cause problems and tensions in the operation of the neighbouring country’s market, even if that neighbouring country is of the same size.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole of the European Union market is going to be subjected to very great pressure. Because in the field of energy, of oil, we are not talking about solely national decisions, I am afraid, but European Union decisions, because the market involves the whole of the European Union and, therefore, the proposal is not that the Commission should decide what should be done or not. The proposal is that, by means of a system of comitology, with the participation of all the States of the Union, there should be consensus and agreement on how to use those margins, those mechanisms, so as not to cause greater tensions within the European Union’s market. That is what I am advocating. And all of this should guarantee greater security if we think in terms of improving the number of days for citizens and for the European production system.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the field of gas, what I am proposing is that there should be systems and plans essentially relating to management, because in the case of gas we are not just talking about reserves, but in particular of management, in order to guarantee that the consumers whose lives depend on gas do not have shortages and that they have a guaranteed minimum number of days of supply under all circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is what we are talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, what we are talking about is improving security of supply and the functioning of the internal energy market and, therefore, of strengthening the European Union from the point of view not just of guarantees to consumers but also of its economic capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope to see the results of the vote tomorrow and, ladies and gentlemen, as I have always said, of course I will take the result into account and under no circumstances do I intend to use the back door to achieve anything in the event that the honourable Members reject the proposals outright. This is very clear and all I believe is that, tomorrow, you should consider your decisions very carefully before voting, because I believe there is room to improve the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
