<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is a great and genuine honour for me to be here in the European Parliament today on behalf of the Council. I personally welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation in the Middle East. We are witnessing a new chapter of that region’s history, which brings with it both opportunities and considerable challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by welcoming the historic progress made by Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank. The European Union commends the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority for their commitment to overcoming the difficult challenges they both face.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the disengagement process has so far gone well, with the avoidance of significant violence. The Israeli Government, with the assistance of the Palestinian Authority, carried out the disengagement plan effectively and quickly. The security forces evacuated the settlers sensitively but with resolve and determination. In short, they managed a difficult task well.</p>
<p class="contents">We applaud the close coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and encourage them to continue on this path. We are keen to see that disengagement is a success across the board. To this end, we welcome, and urge the continuation of, the restraint shown by the majority of Israelis and, indeed, of Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the disengagement process so far encourages both parties to continue their cooperation on the remaining steps of the process, not least in their close work with the Quartet’s Special Envoy for Disengagement, James Wolfensohn. He has presented plans for action to support Palestinian economic and institutional development in the context of disengagement and beyond, identifying key areas where progress would be needed. These include transport links, border crossings, customs issues between Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, the link between Gaza and the West Bank, and air and sea ports. The international community has pledged its full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Freeing-up of movement within the West Bank is essential to Palestinian economic revival. Improved access for people and goods, while maintaining security for Israelis, will also be crucial to creating a sense of hope for the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking full advantage of the opportunity of disengagement and promoting continued reform of Palestinian institutions – as set out at the London meeting on March 1 – will be our two main priorities during our Presidency. In this context, the European Union will work closely, of course, with Mr Wolfensohn in order to help realise plans to make Gaza economically viable after the Israeli withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we look beyond disengagement to advance the political process and to take advantage of the opportunity it represents. After disengagement, both sides will need to focus on making progress against their roadmap and Sharm El-Sheikh commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">In Iraq, we have also witnessed another important step forward following the publication of Iraq’s constitution as recently as 28 August 2005. We congratulate the Iraqi people on reaching this important milestone in the political process.</p>
<p class="contents">Drafting the constitution has, of course, been difficult. All of Iraq’s communities have worked together to draft this constitution and there have been compromises on all sides. But they have now produced a constitution that we hope will be a key building-block towards a democratic Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the principles of democracy and basic human rights are, with Islam, the founding tenets of the new Iraq. No law can be passed that contradicts those tenets. All Iraqis are held equal before the law, regardless of gender or, indeed, of religion. Freedom of belief is protected in the constitution. All extremist groups are prohibited. The new Iraq pledges to respect its neighbours and its international obligations. The oil of Iraq is owned by all the Iraqi people and is to be exploited so as to maximise the benefit to the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will continue to encourage all Iraqis to play a part in the next stage of the political process by voting on the draft constitution in the October referendum. Broad public support for the constitution will help ensure a stable future for Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqis have succeeded in drafting this constitution despite the actions of terrorists who are trying to destroy the country’s desire for that peaceful future. The Council recognises the many challenges still ahead for Iraq, particularly in terms of the security of its people. The European Union is working to build up the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and the judiciary through its integrated Rule of Law and Police Training Mission.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iran, however, we are deeply concerned by that country’s unilateral resumption of activity at the uranium conversion facility in Esfahan on 8 August. This is in clear breach of successive IAEA Board resolutions and, indeed, the Paris Agreement Iran entered into just last November. The IAEA Board resolution, which was adopted by consensus on 11 August, is a clear and united signal from the international community of its wish that Iran return to suspending all conversion activities without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">We also regret that Iran has chosen to reject, without serious consideration, the European side’s detailed proposals presented on 5 August. These are the most far-reaching proposals for relations between Iran and Europe since the Revolution. They would lead to a new relationship based on cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that the European side is not asking Iran to give up its civil nuclear programme. The European proposal specifically offered support for that programme, but there is no civilian operational need for Iran to develop fuel cycle capabilities. Putting its fuel cycle activities on hold would not affect Iran’s ability to develop a civil power and research programme; yet allowing them to continue would bring Iran closer to the ability to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain committed to a diplomatic solution. We hope Iran will reverse its decision and re-suspend uranium conversion activity. The key to resolving this issue is for Iran to take the confidence-building steps requested of it by successive IAEA Board resolutions and restore the suspension.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of our wider engagement with the region, November’s Euro-Med 10th Anniversary Summit in Barcelona will be a critical opportunity to help the European Union’s Mediterranean partners to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The Barcelona Process needs to modernise and move towards a more results-orientated process, with much more focus on reform. In other words, it needs to address the concerns of the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 Declaration was a landmark and much of it remains valid today. But it still requires much in the way of implementation. This includes the need to address obstacles to progress on governance, human rights, market openness and foreign investment. We want to see medium-term targets adopted at that Summit outlining the kind of region we all want to see in five years.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot achieve these aims without peace in the region. Without peace, we will not achieve the zone of stability and prosperity that is our shared objective. But lack of peace should not also become an extra barrier to progress elsewhere. We would do well to heed the demands of the people across the region for more transparent government, for economic reform and for social and cultural awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that there is a new determination in the region to address the challenges facing its people. We are determined to work hard to ensure that the Barcelona Process plays a full role in addressing the challenges facing citizens across the Euro-Med region. The Summit would be a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate that our partnership is relevant to our peoples and can deliver results on the issues that matter to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partnership can help achieve a step change in regional development and indeed modernisation, through action on good governance, economic reform and education. Delivering results in these key areas, against specific targets and commitments, will help drive forward regional progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, honourable Members, it is my pleasure to be able to address you today on the Middle East peace process at a time when there is a renewed feeling of momentum and hope. After five years of the second Intifada, the past six months of calm have witnessed a downturn in violence and terrorist acts and the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and removal of settlers from certain parts of the northern West bank has passed off smoothly. The professionalism of both sides is to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">But real challenges lie ahead. By this I mean firstly putting in place the conditions necessary so that the Israeli withdrawal creates an opportunity for ordinary Palestinians to improve their daily lives. Secondly, the implementation of the roadmap in full, and thirdly, the creation of a viable Palestinian state at peace with its neighbour, Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises that for the recent disengagement to be considered a success it must bring tangible and immediate improvement to the lives of ordinary Palestinians. The Commission has therefore launched a EUR 60 million package as an immediate response to the withdrawal. This consists of a EUR 40 million infrastructure facility geared to labour-intensive, fast-disbursing projects to restore essential services in the West Bank and Gaza; EUR 12 million assistance to institution-building to help the Palestinians assume governance responsibilities following disengagement, and a package of EUR 8 million focusing on social services, as well as East Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify common projects in the infrastructure sector. I would like to mention here the fact that we have already in place the European neighbourhood policy and that we have already agreed common action plans with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan and that the Commission is absolutely convinced that in the context of the European neighbourhood policy Europe can play an important and helpful role in overcoming the problems of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">This assistance will not, however, achieve its desired results unless Israel and the Palestinian Authority tackle such important issues as movement of people and goods between Gaza and the West Bank and the outside world, the greenhouses, operation of the border terminals, the dismantling and removal of settlers' homes and movement of people within the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that the Commission is providing financial, political and human resources support to the Quartet Special Envoy James Wolfensohn, whose contribution to the disengagement has been remarkable. The Special Envoy has succeeded in fostering dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and Israel on each of these issues. However, only one – the greenhouses – has been settled in full.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is helping in this. We are, for example, ready to fund a new presence at border crossings as a confidence-building measure, if the parties so request. The Commission is also keenly aware of the need to maintain the Israel-Palestinian Authority customs union so as to avoid possible trade disruption and to do what it can to promote interregional trade and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge for the peace process is implementation of the roadmap. The disengagement has clearly been traumatic for Israel, but it has not caused the much-feared rift in Israeli society. On the Palestinian side, President Abbas was able to keep the Palestinian factions in check.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for the international community to help move both sides forward in parallel, helping the Palestinian Authority to make progress on tackling incitement and the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and pressing Israel to bring to a halt the creation of new 'facts on the ground', which threaten to undermine future final status negotiations. Settlement activity in and around Jerusalem and the route of the separation barrier are the two most pressing issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The third challenge is how to promote the creation of a viable Palestinian State, for which the implementation of the roadmap is a necessary condition. There is already renewed impetus for Palestinian reform, institution- building, stemming from the intention of the Palestinian Authority to establish a medium-term plan for economic development and from the G8 political commitment to raise up to EUR 3 billion each year for the next three years in order to fund this plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, the Commission will be putting forward proposals for a comprehensive and coherent medium-term strategy for the European Union's relations with a future Palestinian State, including better coordination of EU positions and financial assistance. We need to see how best we can promote the political and economic viability of a future Palestinian State through targeted assistance in support of reform and institution-building. It is clear that efforts must be geared towards the promotion of human rights and democratic principles, the rule of law, improved security and increased effectiveness of public administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It now falls to the Palestinians – and I would like to mention their leader, Mahmoud Abbas <span class="bold">–</span> to follow the democratic path marked out, to control the extremist movements and to consolidate their institutions. For its part, Israel should also cease building new settlements and together, by means of dialogue, they should seek to establish, as Commissioner Verheugen has just said, two viable States which are secure and have recognised borders based on the United Nations’ resolutions. Of course, other problems remain to be solved, and these are clearly laid out in the road map. I refer to the problem of East Jerusalem, that of the refugees and that of the conflict between Israel and Syria. In addition, all this comes within a political context in which we have seen the resignation of Mr Netanyahu as a member of the government in order to contest Prime Minister Sharon’s leadership of Likud, and also in which there are going to be Palestinian elections. A European Union mission of observers led by our fellow Member Mrs Véronique De Keyser will monitor the latter, and I would like to wish it all the best.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the effect that the European Union must play a fundamental role, in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace in the region. The European Union is the main donor to Palestine. The Union is a partner of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and also of Syria in the future Association Agreement, so it is clear that it must play a fundamental role in the political and economic reforms in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I welcome the initiatives presented by the European Commission as a first step regarding the package of EUR 60 million to rebuild the infrastructures of the region and consolidate the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should have preferred it, however, if it had happened within the framework set out in the roadmap and with the Quartet playing a different role.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it has shown that it is possible to make progress without violence on the road to peace and compliance with international law. We are not ignoring the tensions that have arisen within part of Israeli society and particularly in the political sphere in that country, especially in relation to the prospects that are now opening up and the further steps that have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">An important factor in this situation is the commitment of the international community and the European Union to pursue the only feasible prospect: that of continuing the peace process until the Palestinian people’s right to have a sovereign state is realised, with peace and security for both peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The message that we wish to put across in this debate is very clear and is primarily a political message. The more nationalistic sectors of Israeli society, currently represented by Minister Netanyahu, must not think that they will find any space or understanding unless they comply with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuing the settlements policy will mean condemning Israel to international isolation and encouraging the most extremist sectors in the Palestinian community. At the same time, the proponents of terrorism must avoid claiming the Gaza withdrawal as a victory, since it was the outcome of the renewed prestige of the Palestinian leadership on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, therefore, as you have said, that the Palestinians continue the process that started with the presidential elections. In that respect, we welcome the fact that the date has been set for political elections and we are in favour of pushing ahead with the reforms announced by President Abu Mazen when he was elected, relentlessly continuing the work of opposing terrorism and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, however, the international community must still bear in mind that political terrorism of Islamic origin, which is also of such great concern to people in our own countries, will be dealt a decisive blow if we are able to defuse the main source of hatred and tension, which is the Middle East conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the news has mostly been about misery, violence, war, oppression and ultra-conservative rulers. Nowhere in the world is the lack of freedom as concentrated as, specifically, in the Middle East. Half a billion people live under dictatorships there, with the Israeli democracy as the only exception. That is naturally a problem for the people who live there. They are entitled, just as we are, to democracy and human rights. It is also a global problem. If people can see no future, then frustration, fanaticism and fundamentalism thrive.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, there are signs that the situation is changing. An example of this is today’s presidential election in Egypt. It is a step forward, even if Mubarak will, of course, be the victor. There is, in any case, more than one candidate. The development in Lebanon, whereby the Syrian occupying power was thrown out, is also very positive. The decision to allow women in Kuwait to vote next year is also an important step forward. As has already been mentioned in this Chamber, the evacuation of Gaza which, in spite of everything, went so smoothly, is an incredibly important step for the continued peace process and the establishment of two states. The forthcoming Palestinian election will be an important test of how far the reforms within the Palestinian government have gone and of how the process can progress. Iraq has a government, a draft constitution and powerful forces wanting democracy and stability, but the situation is of course incredibly painful, what with the daily violence that people are forced to live with.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, an incredibly large number of problems remaining in the Middle East. The Presidency mentioned Iran and the mullahs there who, with their nuclear weapons programme, have now been mocking, and trifling with, the world community for several months. This is an issue that the UN must tackle. We cannot continue to engage in ‘pretend negotiations’ with Iran in this way. Its oppression of its own people continues unabated, which is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The oppression of people in the region cannot be tolerated. The EU, together with the United States, international organisations, foundations and the opposition in these and other countries should therefore take a combined initiative and devise an international peace and democracy plan for the whole of the Middle East. It is precisely on democracy that the resources of the Barcelona process should be much more focused. Nothing would be better for peace, stability and the fight against terrorism throughout the world than if democracy were to triumph in the Middle East. We have a big responsibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union should guarantee that every possible effort is made to improve the quality of life of Palestinians in Gaza. The Union ought also to guarantee access to the economy and the opening of the port and the airport as soon as possible. In addition it should press for the development of other aspects of economic activity, such as connection and communication between Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in contrast to the hope represented by Gaza, we fear that the current Israeli policy in Jerusalem may slam shut the so-called window of opportunity just at the most sensitive and volatile point of the conflict. We are absolutely delighted that the majority of Israelis and their government appear to have abandoned the idea of a ‘Greater Israel’, but we regret that that project may possibly be replaced with that of a ‘Greater Jerusalem’ spreading relentlessly over Palestinian territory. So far, 164 km2 of the West Bank have been appropriated, to the north, the east and the south of the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">This unilateral appropriation does not serve Israel’s interests, because it jeopardises any stable peace and security agreement, and is creating a worrying situation on the ground, from the point of view of demography and town-planning. The construction work would effectively amputate East Jerusalem from the West Bank and destroy the territorial continuity that is essential to any future remotely viable or credible Palestinian State. That is a recipe for disaster. The policy would leave the Palestinian cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and East Jerusalem practically cut off from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The E1 Project, which plans homes for 15 000 people, hotels and industrial areas to the east of Jerusalem is of particular concern, and I hope the Council and the Commission will take due note of this. In reality, the project would complete the process of separating the north of the West Bank from the south. The European Union must aim to ensure that Jerusalem becomes a city populated by two peoples, two nations, and also the capital of two viable States living in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of Prime Minister Sharon's disengagement plan was a development which we cannot but welcome, because it unquestionably constitutes a positive development and an important step towards the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must at the same time note that the implementation of this plan, which – I repeat – we welcome, cannot under any circumstances be the final solution to the problem. I consider that it is no coincidence that, while the implementation of the plan has turned the Gaza Strip into a free zone, the number of settlers on the West Bank has increased dramatically recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the private meeting during the official visit between President Borrel and Prime Minister Arial Sharon last June, it would appear clear that the disengagement plan does not form part of a political process with the objective of an end to the occupation, the return of refugees and the foundation of an independent Palestinian state and I greatly fear that the <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> of the occupation continue to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel still maintains control of the borders with Egypt in the Gaza Strip as far as the movement of goods is concerned and continues to maintain the right of strategic intervention in that it continues, at the same time, to control the coast, the airspace and the borders of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the European Parliament and as the European Union in general, should continue to monitor developments in the area with close attention and, at the same time, to exert pressure on all sides to engage in substantial talks which will result before the end of 2005 in significant progress and, very soon, in a final solution to the problem, a solution which cannot but be the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and, of course, the demolition of the wall and an end to the occupation, so that the two nations can build a peaceful future which will contribute to peace and progress throughout the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those are the wise words of Mr Solana, the EU’s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, but do not square up with the truth in the Gaza Strip, on the West Bank and in Lebanon, for indeed, both Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic terror movement, and Hezbollah, its Lebanese strategic ally, serve a dual purpose at the moment. They are fully committed to day-to-day political life and perfect their military formations in the process. With this dual strategy, Hamas and Hezbollah not only bring the internal Palestinian and Lebanese political relations to a head, they also deliberately head for an armed confrontation with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">We will end up with either the Intifada or else persistent armed chaos in the Palestinian regions and the threatening prospect of a new Lebanese civil war – a sad outcome, indeed, of Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. This is a true spectre for the Middle East, certainly if we take Hamas’ present media campaign seriously, for its war cry is: no pointless negotiations with the Zionist enemy, but continuation of the Jihad to liberate the whole of Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this critical situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I am very keen to find out the Council’s position in respect of Hamas and Hezbollah. Are these Islamic terror organisations – or why not just call them warring factions – quasi-normal political negotiating partners for the European Union? I would much rather find out what concrete steps the Council wishes to take to dismantle the so-called military branches of Hamas and Hezbollah. The Council should give me this information on the basis of the UN resolution No 1559 with regard to Hezbollah and our own European list of terrorist organisations with regard to Hamas. This is the perfect opportunity for the European Union, the Council and Commission to fulfil its ambition of being a peace-maker in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an experiment intended to stabilise the region, secure access to oil and facilitate disarmament and demilitarisation, but it failed, and the war against terrorism, having driven a wedge between the European allies, is seen by the Arab world as a strategic campaign to secure oil supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Fanatics were able to depict the American occupation as a war on the Islamic world. Bush has not only left a country in ruins but has also created a breeding ground for more terrorist training camps. The American intervention was nothing more than a badly-prepared occupation, embarked on as a sort of solo act; they underestimated both the potential for resistance and the costs involved – the latter of which they now want their partners, such as us Europeans, to cover after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">For the problem of Israel and the Palestinians, too, no real solution is yet in sight. Although the evacuation of the Gaza Strip and the seeking of a two-state solution appear to have injected some impetus into the peace process, which has dragged on for decades, its success will largely be dependent on the economic success of the new structure, and that is where Europe will, no doubt, have to help out.</p>
<p class="contents">Most disturbing of all is the nuclear weapons race in this region, for which the problematic existence of Israel’s nuclear arsenal is always cited as a pretext. The consequence of this is that Arabs have become convinced that the USA, in any case of doubt, will always take Israel’s side, and nuclear weaponry has become more attractive as a prestige project. Where weapons of mass destruction are concerned, an inherent momentum has developed, scarcely capable of being held in check and spurring neighbouring states to acquire weapons of this type, so that the Middle East remains a region with the potential to threaten the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe may well, at present, be outside the range of rockets from the Middle East, but our also becoming a target is only a matter of time. This means that the EU must redouble its efforts in the Middle East, but Turkish accession will do nothing to stabilise the region, one reason for this being that Islamists do not, whatever some Europeans might hope, accept Turkey as a mediator and channel for communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I and some colleagues here in the Chamber who sought the release of one of the presidential candidates, Dr Ayman Noor, on 12 March will be particularly interested in the outcome, since it was our intention to visit him in prison, where he had been put by the Egyptian authorities, having declared his opposition to President Mubarak.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in Cairo that the United States Secretary of State made an important statement on 22 June at the American University, where she declared that, in the Middle East, democracy was better than stability, overturning – as she put it – 60 years of American policy. There has been a degree of cynicism about this change of approach, but nevertheless it represents some sort of step forward in the relations between the United States and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union should try and reflect this shift in policy; not that democracy is better than stability, but that democracy and human rights are better than ‘business as usual’. One of the things that singles out the European Union’s approach to the Middle East is this conjunction of democracy and human rights. Obviously, I regret that the Commission is rather less than ambitious in its programmes of democratisation, and we hope to see that improve in the coming months. In addition, the European Parliament has a role to play, through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, in particular.</p>

I choose to believe this is the case even though I know that a glass half-full can be considered a glass half-empty. I therefore welcome this withdrawal from Gaza as symbolic of the fact that no settlement is a permanent fixture and that they can all be dismantled in the future. I also choose to believe that the wall, which the Israeli Authority has always declared temporary, will one day fall. I choose to believe that no extremist group will harm this fragile hope of peace with a terrorist attack and, above all, that no authority will take advantage of an isolated criminal act to carry out collective reprisals and ruin any hope of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The withdrawal from Gaza has been difficult. The Israeli Government has carried it out with courage and determination and the Palestinian Authority with a great deal of maturity. Yet the glass is sadly also half-empty. Continued colonisation in the West Bank runs counter to the idea of long-lasting peace, in the same manner as the encirclement of East Jerusalem and the way in which Israel is gaining ground there. The potential isolation of Gaza, which is over-populated and cut off from any possible economic development, makes it a real ticking time bomb.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I emphasise the need for Europe, while paying tribute to those who have secured this successful disengagement, not to be blind to these worrying signs and to continue to exert pressure so that Gaza has air and sea ports and access to the West Bank and to Egypt, thus preventing it from closing on its inhabitants like a trap, so that international law and humanitarian law are respected and regularly evaluated in this region and so that the road map is relaunched.</p>

An absence of violence, of victims and of civil war, too, is a success story for which the Palestinian Authority can also take credit. Mr Abbas has spared no effort to facilitate the operations and, above all, to prevent any terrorist attack during the entire period of disengagement.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, you will ask me: what must be done? It is a question of turning this military success into a political success, of harnessing this positive energy in order to return to the road map, since the withdrawal from Gaza can only be the start of a process. The major challenges awaiting Ariel Sharon as well as Mahmoud Abbas are on a huge scale: an end to the settlements, more substantial withdrawals, particularly on the part of the Israelis, and, of course, for the Palestinian leader the disarmament of the terrorist organisations. Following the destruction of a building in Gaza on Monday and the assassination of his security advisor only this morning, Abu Mazen has just demanded <span class="bold">–</span> scarcely a few hours ago <span class="bold">–</span> a plan for disarming Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide him with the means to continue; we are all aware that the battle has begun between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas for control of Gaza and that the EUR 60 million that has just been released – and which the Commissioner has spoken about – will be a vital strategic support for the Palestinian leader. We thank the Commission, we rely on it and we will be particularly vigilant, I wish to say, in ensuring that stringent checks are carried out to reassure European taxpayers about how this significant sum of money is to be appropriated.</p>
<p class="contents">‘There is a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time for war and a time for peace’, those are not my words, they are in the Ecclesiastes; I was talking about hope just now, not naïve optimism.

The Quartet is scheduled to meet on 20 September in order to relaunch the road map. How should this be approached? To my mind, the answer is clear: it should be approached resolutely.</p>
<p class="contents">The unilateral pull-out from Gaza has justifiably raised expectations. There has been a lull on the part of the armed Palestinian groups and legislative elections are set to take place on 25 January. This is a positive scenario, but one based on a particular set of circumstances, and the opportunity could go to waste. Europe’s position must therefore be a firm one.</p>
<p class="contents">Some 8 000 settlers have left Gaza as a result of a decision by Israel – a most welcome development. Yet this event must not conceal the other side of the coin; between June 2004 and 2005, 12 800 new settlers moved to the West Bank and the President of Parliament in Jerusalem wants to set up another Jewish settlement in the ancient heart of the Arab city. This is not the way to go about making peace! The settlers have left Gaza. This is terrific news, but the Gaza that has been handed over to the Palestinians urgently requires an airport and the Israeli authorities have an unacceptable veto over this project.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaza has a border with Egypt at Rafa. Palestinians and Egyptians could run this border, but Israel insists on maintaining a presence in the area, as though it were another of its checkpoints. This must not be allowed to happen, because Gaza must not be a poisoned chalice, a prison that the guards have handed over to the inmates, in which they are not allowed to move around and in which their already fragile economy is rendered unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">The exit from Gaza is not the end of the story. This is the message that should guide the fresh initiatives by the Quartet. Peace is possible provided we do not waste this opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UCF in Isfahan is complete and UF4 and UF6 gases are produced. We converted 36 tonnes of yellow cake into gas. Iran began talks with the WTO. Iran was recognised as one of the countries with a nuclear fuel cycle. We managed to make far greater progress than North Korea'.</p>
<p class="contents">That was said on Iranian Channel 2 on 4 August by Mr Hussein Mussavian, the head of the Iranian nuclear delegation. There is no military option; there is no regime change option. Economic sanctions will only create a much larger disaster than the one in Iraq. What can we do after Russia's expected refusal of referral to the UNSC? We can only try to strip Iran of international recognition, immediately block its WTO entry, impose tough diplomatic sanctions, exclude it from international sporting, cultural and social events and the Olympic Games. Those are the only tools we have.</p>
<p class="contents">As the head of Parliament's Israeli delegation, I wholeheartedly congratulate both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments. I also welcome the EU statement on this engagement. We promise to monitor daily the use of the EUR 60 million hopefully spent before the Palestinian elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We all support the conditional Syrian association agreement as the last wedge to keep the door open. Egypt is the cradle of Middle Eastern politics. Clear, tough and immediate pressure for democratic conditions for democratic candidates in democratic elections will be more use than any Iraq-style military intervention. Nevertheless, legitimisation of the current process in Iraq is a must if civil war is to be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Twelve months from now, the Middle East will be a different region. The threats to our security are enormous. We have to stop immediately making a distinction between external relations and our internal security, between cutting out the roots of extremism and counter-terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then they protested. Today, with all the qualifications, they celebrated. Despite all the difficulties, hope succeeded over cynicism. In the wake of these developments, it is the role of the European Union and international community to keep open this moment of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the continuing Commission commitment, repeated this afternoon by our colleague Mr Verheugen, to economic reconstruction in the Palestinian territories. Gaza represents one of the most scarred and desolate corners of the world. The World Bank says that nearly half of the Palestinians there live below the poverty line. Freedom from fear must be matched by the freedom to eat and to work. That is why I welcome the President-in-Office's commitment this afternoon to work with Israel and the other parties on free movement, to facilitate the movement of 20 000 Gaza residents who work in Israel and to lift the blockages of borders of land, sea and air. Gaza cannot be economically viable otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of Parliament's Electoral Observer Commission, I agree with colleagues that we have a crucial role to play to ensure that the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London conference on security, democratic reform and good governance are realised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the critics will continue to remind us that more new settlements have been built this year on the West Bank than were evacuated in the last month, that 8 000 settlers are left but more than 240 000 still remain. The differences on the 1967 borders and on the status of Jerusalem are as deeply entrenched today as is that much-disputed security wall. We cannot avoid these uncomfortable truths. The only hope remains the roadmap, endorsed by the Quartet, by this European Union. It is our responsibility to keep that hope and opportunity alive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The withdrawal has also been welcomed by the Muslim world as a first phase of a process. The significance of this development was displayed last week by the first public talks between the Foreign Ministers of Israel and Pakistan. The European Council, under the Presidency of the United Kingdom, must maximise its special relationship with the US to make joint efforts to add to the existing ties with other Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Such political progress will have tremendous significance, not just as regards relations between these two states, but as a stepping stone towards a normalisation of relations between Israel and the whole of the Muslim and Arab world. Indeed, it will help in our very own action plan to face head-on the issue of terrorism within our own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">However, worrying messages continue to come out of Israel. As recently as July, for example, the Knesset approved Amendment 5 to the Civil Wrongs Law. The amendment prohibits Palestinians from suing for damages for injuries sustained as a result of illegal Israeli gunfire; this is in clear violation of basic human rights. This week, there is a rare opportunity to begin rectifying these injustices.</p>
<p class="contents">All this exacerbates Israel's persistent defiance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July, which heavily criticised the illegal separation wall in Eastern Jerusalem. Incidentally, mention of the wall was noticeable by its absence from the UK Presidency's <span class="italic">Prospects for the EU in 2005</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind the Council that the ICJ's opinion articulates obligations incumbent on the whole of the international community to see that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace cannot be achieved without justice and it is justice for the individual – the men, women and children living this conflict on a daily basis – which is the key to lasting peace. It is these individuals' right to self-determination which must be secured.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, as Israel's principal trading partner, is in a unique position to utilise the human rights clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement and bring pressure to bear on the Israeli Government to comply, specifically with the ICJ opinion, and more generally to ensure that disengagement is followed by credible political process where outstanding claims for justice under international humanitarian law are resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if the European Council, under the leadership of the UK Presidency, is to play a significant and constructive role in the peace process, it must ensure that concerns of economic and political expediency are not permitted to override the fundamental rights of a people that has suffered enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only process ahead is the political process. Political process and armed struggle cannot coexist: it is either one or the other. Both sides are now arriving at this conclusion, as demonstrated from the Palestinian side, with the democratic election of President Abbas, the mandate that he has received to negotiate peace and the fact that even Hamas is now slowly entering the democratic process; and from the Israeli side, with the Gaza disengagement, despite formidable opposition and the traumatic experience of the Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time to consolidate these positive developments. The Council and the Commission – either through the Quartet or on their own – must discourage, firstly, those Palestinians who may consider that the Gaza disengagement is a result of their Intifada; secondly, those in Israel who may consider that this licenses them to proceed with further settlements or the continuation of the wall and, finally, encourage both sides, so that they avoid actions that strengthen the hands of those on the other side who oppose the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections will be held in the months ahead in either Palestine or Israel, which is likely to create a sort of vacuum. Good management of this vacuum is required so that the momentum for peace is kept alive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will have no lasting effect, though, if we do not endeavour – together with the Palestinians and with Israeli support – to make Gaza a viable region, and if we fail, at the same time, to persuade the Israelis that more needs to be done in the West Bank as well. There will not be as many withdrawals as we in this House – and, above all, the Palestinians – would probably like to see, but, as Mr Kasoulides said, this process must continue if it is not to collapse and deny us many of the positive outcomes for which we hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to join Mr McMillan-Scott and others in highlighting the importance of our investing in the whole region, especially in the development of democracy and civil society. One aspect of the war on terrorism, about which we have had a debate today with Mr Clarke is the need for development in the surrounding region, in particular in the Islamic and Arab world, and for that the right political and financial measures will be needed. That is something of which I would like to remind the Presidency: financial resources will, of course, be needed if we are to invest in Gaza and in the region as a whole. Making promises and committing oneself to this is one thing, but thought also has to be given to this when planning budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will turn to Iran. We are deeply concerned about the way things are going in Iran, but they are a consequence of our toleration of the development of nuclear weapons not only by such countries as Pakistan and India, but also by Israel, and also of our inability to limit their general proliferation. Although action on our part is necessary, it has to be taken in consultation with all interested parties if it is to be effective. It is because unilateral sanctions will not be effective that this matter must be handed over to the United Nations in order for a common solution to be found. I hope that the British Presidency of the Council will go down that road with perceptiveness and clarity of vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now see a development that offers hope, consisting of withdrawals from Gaza, together with small signs of democracy in the Arab world. This means that the demands for a European Middle East policy must become much clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran is a country with the express political objective of obliterating one of the UN’s Member States, namely Israel. Iran is breaching the Non-Proliferation Agreement by developing mid-range missiles with a view to reaching targets in those countries we are now talking about. It expresses the same anti-Semitism expressed by too many regimes and groups in that part of the world. It cannot be acceptable to support terrorism, as Iran does.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wishes to be a power in the peace process, it must now support the active forces of democracy and peace. The EU must take action against those who do not accept international agreements and who consciously choose the path of violence. We must create both support and a structure for democratic development throughout the Middle East. There would be no better basis for peaceful and stable development in this part of the world than a breakthrough for democracy. We see the many different signs of democratic development. The EU must, then, vigorously support those who keep the flame of democracy and freedom alight. We must also ensure that the support we give the Palestinian Authority and other countries is combined with clear demands for democratic development. We have an opportunity to play a role in the interests of peace but, in that case, we must also show that we can strengthen democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also represents a fresh chance to achieve security for the state of Israel and the creation of a Palestinian state. Ariel Sharon’s government should be given due recognition for its decision, as should the majority of the Israeli people for the backing they have lent to the evacuation of the Jewish settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to make particular mention of the Israeli people’s support for this process. Even though the Israelis are descendants of refugees, they backed the evacuation of 9 000 settlers from Gaza. This is proof of their desire for genuine peace with the Palestinian nation, and of the democratic nature of the Israeli state in the Middle East. The reaction of the majority of Israelis is also proof that the country is a worthy partner for the European Union in the construction of an international order based on respect for human rights and democracy. The fact that Israeli public opinion is in favour of the evacuation, and clearly opposed to anti-Arab attacks, can be taken as evidence that the modern world is not condemned to a clash of civilisations or to the victory of fundamentalist philosophies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should continue to support the steps taken by James Wolfensohn, the envoy of the Madrid Quartet, to coordinate EU funds with those donated by other sponsors, and to ensure that these funds are used as efficiently as possible. According to Javier Solana, the European Union could act as the third party in the field of border control and customs checks. The Gaza Strip must not descend into terror and anarchy, or turn into a new terrorist bridgehead.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must do everything in its power to ensure that the evacuation of the Jewish settlements in Gaza results in negotiations. The latter should at the very least tackle such problems as the continued withdrawal of Israeli troops, the demarcation of the border and the status of Jerusalem, and they should make it possible to implement the two-state solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ongoing terrorist campaign in Iraq, of course, still poses a serious threat to stability in the region. Iraq is about to have its first democratic constitution, which, although lacking support from the Sunni community, as least has on board the Shias and the Kurds, has avoided an Islamic theocracy, and kept women involved in the process. October may see a rejection of the constitution by the Sunnis, but they will then have to get involved in the resulting parliamentary elections and the next constitutional draft, or face a fragmentation of Iraq, in which they will eventually lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria must play a more responsible role in apprehending terrorists crossing from its territory into Iraq. Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs. Having ended its nine-month freeze on uranium enrichment, it is now on a collision path with the United States and the EU, a case likely to end in the United Nations Security Council, where I hope Russia and China will also support tough, non-proliferation measures or sanctions, if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel is to be commended for its peaceful withdrawal from Gaza, which must now rapidly fall under the control of the Palestinian Authority, although the assassination of Moussa Arafat augurs badly. It is understandable that border controls with Egypt will require Israeli and international monitoring for security reasons for some time to come. Let us now hope that all the parties can come together to get the roadmap for peace back on the road. The Palestinian parliamentary elections in January will, of course, be telling.</p>
<p class="contents">Lebanon, following Syria's withdrawal, seems to be settling after its elections and arrests have now been made in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, apparently confirming the suspicion of the involvement of the pro-Syrian security forces. We all wish the United Nations investigator, Mr Detlev Mehlis, every success in bringing those guilty to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to ask them to read the interviews by the Israeli Prime Minister Arial Sharon in the Jerusalem Post, the <span class="italic">Ha'aretz</span> and the <span class="italic">Ma'ariv</span> on 22 April 2004, in which the real objectives of the unilateral disengagement of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip are presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon speaks in these interviews about addressing the risk of demographic change in Israel and about addressing the security problems of the Israeli occupying forces. Mr Sharon points out that we have merely rid ourselves of problematic settlements while, on the other hand, both the illegal settlements and the construction of the illegal security wall are continuing, in violation of the resolutions of the International Court at The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I believe that the declaration by the British Presidency on 25 August is excessively optimistic, as is the declaration by Mr Solana. I fear that these declarations do not reflect the harsh reality. I believe that the departure of the settlers, in order to be a positive step and a window of opportunity, must be integrated into the framework of the implementation of the roadmap, without any new terms or conditions from the Israeli side.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Alexander referred to serious problems in the Gaza Strip. I would highlight the need to open the airport, to open the port, to reverse the social and economic isolation of Gaza. The people there are wretched. There is a high rate of unemployment and poverty. We, as the European Union, bear a huge responsibility and I believe that we also need to exert pressure within the framework of the Quartet in the direction of the United States for an international peace conference with the participation of Sharon and Abbas.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, you have just told one of the honourable Members of this House that you are terribly sorry, but it is time to stop. I fear that you may soon be terribly sorry because it is time for me to start the wind-up to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it has been an important and timely debate for Parliament this afternoon. I am genuinely grateful for the insights that have been garnered in our debate that reflect the experience and expertise of Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra began by echoing the points made by Commissioner Verheugen, recognising the hopeful signs that have emerged over recent months within the region. I can assure him that the Presidency is very aware of the key role that the European Union can play as part of the Quartet in advancing the peace process. Let me, however, at this stage reiterate a point that was made by the Commissioner in his introductory remarks in paying tribute not to a European, but to an American, James Wolfensohn, who has already made a tremendous contribution to the work of the Quartet and indeed to the successful withdrawal from Gaza that we have seen in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Napoletano, in stating her abhorrence of terrorism, echoed sentiments that I am sure are felt by all of us in this House. That is why we recognise the importance of building on the momentum that has been established in the region in recent months and why I believe that there is a shared determination between the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to take forward that momentum in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Malmström recognised the importance of human rights in Iran. Let me assure her that we are aware that serious violations of human rights continue to occur within that country. The Council is especially concerned about the number of executions of juvenile offenders in recent weeks. The European Council is clear that our relations with Iran can only move forward if Iran takes action to address our political concerns in areas such as human rights, which she highlighted in her speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hammerstein Mintz talked of Gaza representing 'a light of hope'. Let us all hope that that is what it proves to be. Our challenge now, as I have always made clear, is to continue to advance the peace process. Disengagement offers the prospect of Israel withdrawing settlements from Gaza and part of the West Bank for the first time in history. This is a real opportunity for progress. However, on the specific point made by the honourable Member about Jerusalem, the European Union has continually made its view clear on settlement activity, not just in the West Bank, but also in East Jerusalem. We have made clear to the Government of Israel that all settlement activity should be frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Adamou described withdrawal as a significant step, but recognised the equally significant challenges ahead. I would simply reiterate that the long-term objective for the European Commission is assistance to support the creation, as was suggested, of an independent democratic Palestinian state. That continues to be one of our key objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder quoted the High Representative, Javier Solana, when he spoke of his concerns regarding the activities of Hamas and Hezbollah. I can assure you that the European Union keeps the status of Hamas and Hezbollah under constant review and the European Union stands firm in its policy of not dealing with terrorists. Hamas is subject to a European Union asset freeze and European Union officials will not meet members of the Hamas leadership until it recognises Israel's right to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mölzer spoke on various points with which I find myself frankly not in agreement, both as regards some of the issues that he focused on and his characterisation of some of the other issues. Where we were able to find common ground was on the possibility of the European Union making the advancement of the Middle East peace process one of its objectives in an area where we can make a positive contribution. At least on that there was agreement between us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr McMillan-Scott spoke of both the Egyptian elections – as did Mr Tannock – and also of the words of the Secretary of State of the United States, Condoleezza Rice, at a recent speech at the American University in Cairo. I noted with interest the points he made regarding democracy and human rights, later echoed by Mr Hökmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Keyser raised the issue of the Israeli barrier. The best response I can offer on behalf of the Presidency is to quote directly to her the clear view of the June European Council on this matter: 'The European Council, while recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens from attacks, remains concerned by the continuing construction of the separation barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is contrary to the provisions of international law.'</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries spoke of the need to turn the military withdrawal we have seen in recent days into a political success, expressing sentiments reiterated by Mr Portas. Of course, that is true. I agree that after disengagement, it will be important to ensure that momentum is maintained and that both Israel and the Palestinians focus on implementation of the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be important for the Palestinian Authority to ensure that law and order is maintained in Gaza. Conditions on access and on trade must allow economic growth and stability for the Gaza economy, a point made by a number of honourable Members, but equally allow for Israel to have security from militant or terrorist attacks, which is its right.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hybášková raised the issue of Iran and in particular the issue of diplomatic sanctions being applied. It is important to remind this House that the IAEA board meets on 19 September. The European Union has said that it will support calls for Iran to be reported to the United Nations Security Council at that meeting, but we are discussing the next step with our international partners. It is therefore important to await the discussions that will take place first at the IAEA board meeting on 19 September and I would not wish to anticipate those discussions at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my colleagues from the United Kingdom, Mr Howitt, brought his experience as an electoral observer to his contribution to our debate this afternoon. He spoke powerfully, I would argue, about what he described, somewhat tactfully, as the uncomfortable truths that endure, even after the recent withdrawal. He is right to acknowledge the scale of the challenge faced by the region, as well as the scale of the achievement that has been accomplished. He recognised, rightly again, the contribution that we have to make and the responsibility that we bear as a member of the Quartet to make further progress and to sustain hope and banish cynicism, which has been too common in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karim raised the issue of the barrier, and I would simply reiterate the point I made in relation to the stated position of the European Council as recently as June. I would remind the honourable Member that Article 2 of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement states that: 'Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.' I can assure the honourable Member that where we have concerns about Israeli actions on human rights, we will raise – and have raised – those concerns with the Israeli Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also uses the opportunity to raise issues of concern, including human rights, at the EU-Israel Association Council. We will consider in due course what issues to raise in advance of the EU-Israel Association Council scheduled to be held at the end of our Presidency at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully to Mr Kasoulides and I assure him that we will share the objective of maintaining the momentum for peace in the months ahead. Mr Swoboda spoke of the need for a coordinated approach to address the issue of proliferation. Although I speak today on behalf of the Presidency rather than the British Government, I would simply point out at this stage, as a serving minister in the British Foreign Office, that to date the E3 process has been a powerful affirmation of that approach, whereby a coordinated approach has been secured across Europe, which has strengthened our hand in the important and difficult discussions that have had to take place directly with Iran in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pinior paid tribute to Israel's step in withdrawing from Gaza and I once again echo that sentiment on behalf of the Presidency. As well as discussing the issue of Egypt – of which I have already spoken – Mr Tannock raised the issue of the Constitution for Iraq. This is an achievement. Indeed, in the official briefing I received in preparation for today's debate, it was suggested that I should tell this august body that constitutions are never the easiest things to write. I need hardly make that point to the European Parliament in light of recent events. But, to be entirely serious, it is important to recognise how challenging the achievement of a constitution has been in Iraq, against a backdrop of nearly 30 years of tyranny and in the face of ongoing terrorist attacks on innocent people designed specifically to prevent them reaching agreement. In a country as diverse as Iraq, surely that is all the more so the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, therefore, that we remember those points, but also that this is an Iraqi Constitution, written by democratically elected Iraqi politicians on behalf of their people. It works to balance that country's distinctive traditions – which, frankly, are very different from our own within Europe – with its desire for democracy. It is a huge step forward for Iraq and one that should be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Presidency, let me thank all those honourable Members who have participated today, pay tribute to the contribution of the Commission earlier in the debate and express my gratitude for the points raised in what I believe will continue to be an important subject and focus of our work in the remaining months of our Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must also try to clarify the real reasons that led Sharon to dismantle the Gaza settlements, when we know that he was chiefly responsible for devising and implementing the policy of the expansion and consolidation of the Israeli occupation, including the settlements and the wall that seeks to annex further territories on the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to note is that the policy of settling the Gaza Strip was a failure, given the small size of the territory and the massive population density – around 1.3 million people lived in an area measuring just 362 km2. This means that the 8 000 Israeli settlers living there (0.6% of the population) occupied 20% of the territory, thereby creating unsustainable demographic tension and pressure, leading to devastating consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Sharon did this, yet continues to maintain the isolation of Gaza, which will remain surrounded – by land, sea and air – by the Israeli army. This will keep it as an enclave within Israel and land links with the West Bank will remain subject to Israeli control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
