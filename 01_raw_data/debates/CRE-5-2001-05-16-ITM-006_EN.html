<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of February Albanian extremists took control of the village of Tanusevci on the border between Kosovo and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which caused violent clashes between extremists and FYROM’s army and police force.</p>
<p class="contents">In the middle of March, unrest spread to the town of Tetovo in western FYROM when uniformed men took the villages to the north of the town and then fired on the town at random. The FYROM army launched a counter-offensive against the occupied villages which ended on 1 April. However, later that month, the extremists renewed fighting in villages north-west of the town of Kumanovo, and the fighting is still continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a risk of out and out civil war, and the European Union has worked hard to prevent such a development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union reacted almost immediately to the fighting around Tanusevci and Tetovo by issuing declarations condemning the violence and urging all the parties involved to cease the violence immediately. Intensive diplomatic activity commenced in Skopje to support the FYROM government, the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity. At local level, the EU Presidency set up close contacts with the key players. The FYROM government was urged to act with restraint against the extremists, and the leaders of the major Albanian parties were urged to openly distance themselves from and isolate the extremists, while the Slavic-Macedonian opposition parties were urged not to exploit the situation to whip up nationalistic feelings against the Albanian minority. From the outset, efforts were also made, through the country’s media, to get over to the general public the EU’s message of distancing themselves from the extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, intensive shuttle diplomacy was also started. Foreign Minister Kerim was invited to discussions with the EU’s President-in-Office and High Representative Solana in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 19 March. The following day, an EU Troika of political directors travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje, and at the end of the same week the EU Troika of foreign ministers travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje and Pristina to emphasise their support for the government and their condemnation of the extremists’ actions.</p>
<p class="contents">One result of the visits was that the Troika got the Albanian leaders in FYROM and Kosovo to sign declarations publicly distancing themselves from the violent methods of the extremists and instead urging them to put forward their demands in political forums and in accordance with democratic procedures. As a further sign of the EU’s support for FYROM’s political leaders, President Trajkovski was invited to the European Council in Stockholm on 23 March. Here, he had the opportunity to present his views on the vulnerable position of the country to the entire European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to underpin the political support financially, a review was carried out of the EU’s aid to FYROM for this year. Intensive work was done by both the Commission and the EU Member States to, for example, make up the financial deficit for the new university in Tetovo, offering teaching in Albanian, and to try to rapidly implement measures to rebuild houses destroyed in the villages north of Tetovo and support other projects to strengthen inter-ethnic cohesion in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone is no doubt aware, on 9 April, following almost a year of negotiations, FYROM was the first country in the western Balkans to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The agreement is a key step in FYROM’s rapprochement with the EU, and the signing was also an important symbol of the EU’s support for the country. Like other countries in the western Balkans, FYROM is currently seen as a potential candidate for EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the unrest in FYROM has made it clear that there is a real need to improve the position and rights of the Albanians and other minorities in the country. In conjunction with the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the FYROM government launched an action plan for reforms to speed up the comprehensive adaptation required by the agreement, but also to intensify the inter-ethnic dialogue and strengthen the position of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we have to say that the practical reforms have made slow progress. So far, all that has been achieved is avoiding a declaration of a state of war, postponing the public census until October and setting a date of 27 January 2002 for new parliamentary elections. However, the main success is that, after intensive negotiations and pressure from the international community, a broad coalition government has been set up which will function as the political basis for the difficult but necessary decisions which have to be taken in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that there are measures which the government should and could implement immediately. These include starting a third TV channel for minority languages, introducing the long-overdue act on strengthening local self-determination and ratifying the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages. In the medium term, and ahead of next year’s election, the government must also make the necessary constitutional changes to even out the differences between the position of the Slavic-Macedonian population and that of other minorities in the country, and also take the action necessary to strengthen the representation of the minorities within the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Troika of EU foreign ministers is returning to Skopje to promote this message. Foreign Minister Mrs Lindh travelled straight from this House to Skopje. At this meeting, the new coalition government will be invited to report on its progress and ongoing action plans in conjunction with the General Affairs Council of 25 – 26 June.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, FYROM is facing a difficult but necessary process of reform, and time is running out if a new civil war is to be avoided. It is important to point out that the main responsibility lies with FYROM’s leaders. The EU has an important supporting role to play, and the Council, along with High Representative Solana and, especially, the Presidency at central and local level, intends to continue its support for this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that there is a vital role for Parliament and its party groups. In the period up to the end of June, the coalition government will need support and encouragement, as well as the exercise of pressure, to be able to implement the necessary reforms and, at the same time, keep the fragile government coalition intact. The Council believes that it would be invaluable if Parliament’s party groups could contact their partners in FYROM and support them in this process, if this is not already happening. It is still possible to avoid all-out civil war in FYROM. We must ensure that we make the most of this chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, this dialogue started a few weeks ago in cooperation with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also continue to support the new government in promoting tolerance and restraint and applying the principle of “dialogue not force” in order to settle differences of opinion. My colleague Chris Patten and the presidency will transmit this message to the new government and the president of the country when the troika of ministers of the European Union visits Skopje today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April. This was a very important and, without doubt, an historic step towards stability in the Balkans as a whole. Macedonia is the first country in the region to sign such an agreement. The second agreement with Croatia was initialled in Brussels last month.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement is symbolic of the close relations between the Union and Macedonia and will provide a basis for fast rapprochement with the European Union. The most important aspects of the agreement are the creation of free trade zone between the Community and Macedonia within ten years of the date on which the agreement enters into force, the start of political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation, an undertaking by the Macedonian authorities to harmonise their laws with EC law, especially provisions relating to the internal market, and cooperation on justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement makes it quite clear that Macedonia has European prospects. These prospects now need to be given tangible form. The agreement does not therefore represent the end of a process, it represents the beginning of a difficult process for this country. It is now up to Macedonia to prove to the European Union that it has the will to fulfil the underlying criteria and, most importantly, this country must now show that it is in a position to resolve conflicts between ethnic groups through political dialogue rather than by force.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU shall continue to give its unrestricted support. The Commission condemns the renewed acts of terrorism in northern Macedonia and urges all the members of the Albanian minority to leave it to the two official Albanian parties to explain the demands of this ethnic minority within a democratic forum, either with the new government or with the special committee chaired by President Trajkovski.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is already doing its best to facilitate this dialogue. As the members of the European Parliament know, we are in an extremely critical phase in the history of Macedonia. The European Union shall continue to express its solidarity with this country and its confidence in its people. As far as we are concerned, the major objective of stabilising the Balkans cannot be achieved unless the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Macedonia are guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the basic effort needs to be made by the people themselves and their political leaders. They themselves are responsible for the future of their country. In all events, we shall promote continuing dialogue leading to tangible results. We are positive that a peaceful and democratic process which attends to the legitimate concerns of the minorities is the only way to set Macedonia on course for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the very first time over recent months we have seen the Council and Commission starting to act in concert in the case of the former Yugoslavia; everyone has the same take on the situation and we have joint action as a result. We just have to bear in mind that we cannot turn our back on this country once the fighting abates and the shooting stops. On the contrary, we must monitor the situation continuously and closely, by which I mean on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993. We have constantly discussed all the problems with our Macedonian counterparts and the Macedonian government. We have called on them time and again not to underestimate the simmering ethnic conflict and to do everything to prevent such conflict from breaking out.</p>
<p class="contents">For years little was done and that is a pity. If the truth be told, this problem was criminally neglected for years. But now this last government has got down to business over the last two and a half years and has done much to help the Albanian people and get things moving. And then, just when we have important ministers of Albanian origin with important portfolios, just when a real solution has been found to the question of Albanian education and the problem of Tetovo University, at that precise moment, hostilities break out. And we simply have to concede that they have been imported from outside. I am surprised that none of the previous speakers, from either the Council or the Commission, reminded us that these hostilities were imported from outside. That is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections were held in Kosovo last year. If elections had been held in Kosovo this spring, we would probably have been able to prevent this unrest in the neighbouring country. But we have no proof of that. Now we have a situation in which Mr Hekkerup, without talking to us here in Parliament – I do not know if he has spoken to the Commission, but he has certainly never spoken to us; we pay for the administration of UNMIK, we are the main payers, but no-one asks us what should be done down there – is designing a constitution which neither the Serbs nor the Albanians support 100%. It may well be a very good constitution. But if a constitution is announced in May and a vote is held on it in November, that gives seven months for the extremists to again find plenty of cause for unrest. It is just not on. You have to learn from your mistakes. Perhaps they should have asked their counterparts in the European Parliament. We could have told them. So I think that mistakes were made. We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Now back to Macedonia. The visitors in the gallery will have noticed that it says <span class="italic">"Situation ARYM" </span>up there. In English it would be <span class="italic">"Situation FYROM"</span>. This is none other than the country of Macedonia, whose neighbours are refusing it its name. It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. FYROM and ARYM are in fact temporary aids and should soon be consigned to the dustbin of history.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the formation of the all-party coalition and hope that it will succeed in moving towards ethnic cohabitation. We hope that none of the parties will pursue separatist or nationalistic agendas. So I think we are on the right course here. I take up the Council's suggestion. We shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I still cannot see that there is the will to find a compromise and for understanding on both sides. But we must be clear on one thing: the KLA should not dictate events, developments and the pace of solutions in Macedonia. Nothing would please the KLA more than to parade the Albanian parties and dictate their demands and nothing would please the KLA more than overreaction on the part of the Slav-Macedonian parties. With all due respect for what Mrs Pack said – and I nearly always agree with her – I do not see the connection with Kosovo in the same light. Because the badly needed elections in Kosovo are elections for democracy, not for terrorist organisations like the KLA.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is to be done? First there are thoughts of changing the constitution and there is much to be said in favour of that. It is just that I think it should be determined with as few ethnic considerations as possible and geared to the rights of each and everyone under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Albanian minority definitely needs more judges, more policemen and more officials in the administration. Here again the primary concern must be qualification, with the ethnic principle coming second.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, more certainly needs to be done in the area of education and training. In the medium to long term, we must assume that Tetovo University which, most importantly, has been substantially funded by the international community – with almost nothing from the Albanian diaspora, it must be said – will, at long last, become a public university. I think this is the right step to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address one more fundamental point: both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner mentioned the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. In fact, just such an agreement has also been initialled with Croatia. However, we must think one step ahead. I think that the region as a whole needs to be able to feel at home in Europe. Perhaps we should consider whether, as a matter of principle, we could check every two years after a Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed, if the country is willing and able to acquire candidate status for the European Union. Because when I look at Bulgaria and Romania on the one side and at Turkey on the other, there is a certain restrained – one might almost say unfair treatment of the Balkans. What was done in Zagreb was a good thing. But I think we should go one stage further and say to the region loud and clear: if you are willing to resolve all your economic, social and political problems, then you have a real chance of obtaining candidate status for the European Union. We in the European Union are prepared to check this with the countries with which we have already concluded agreements at regular intervals. Only the road to Europe, the vision, the realistic vision of belonging to Europe can bring about stability in this region. Not in the short term, but in the medium and long term. And this vision, this Utopia must be very a specific vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we must definitely view Macedonia as a potential member of the European Union. But we cannot of course say that it is in fact already a candidate, for the simple reason that the Copenhagen criteria are just not being met in Macedonia. Therefore those political criteria must be fulfilled. For that reason, I think – and I should like to make a minor correction to what Mr Swoboda says – we should offer the prospect of possible membership, but only if, for example, that dreadful concept of a state-constituting nation disappears from the constitution and statutes of Macedonia. It is a huge obstacle, often in other countries too, to reaching a reasonable ethnic understanding between citizens. Surely we must be able to make Macedonia into an ordinary secular state and there are enough indications that the president of the country with his American experience understands that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we as the European Union can do something ourselves. I remember very well from a previous period that a departing Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Elleman-Jensen, surprised the House by exclaiming that the whole Council was sick of Greece’s behaviour towards Macedonia. That caused a row. But I believe it was an extremely salutary expression of feeling, particularly since the Council could after all exert some pressure on Greece as a fellow-member and say : conclude those negotiations, ensure that there is a reasonable solution, do not persist with measures that are in fact humiliating for Macedonia. We can also ensure from outside that destabilising effects which were in fact at issue in those negotiations, are removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would urge the Council to look into its own heart and say to its own members: friends, what can we do? Stop going on endlessly about that name, that flag, etc. We can also ask the Macedonians to achieve a European approach to their own constitutional structure. Otherwise it will be impossible for them to become normal members of the European Union in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the name and Greece's responsibility, which Mr Oostlander touched on, the only thing I have to say, yet again, is that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia only exists thanks to continuous material and moral support from Greece. Leaving aside the name, without this support, you can be sure that Milosevic's Yugoslavia would have broken it up long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the present situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, we have a clash of two political philosophies: the political philosophy expounded by the Representative of the Council, whereby two different nations live within the same borders, cooperate and live in friendship, and the philosophy which says that the rights of the Albanian nation can only be secured by armed struggle and bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say to the Council representative that this is a philosophy – and I know because I come from these parts and I have lived through a civil war – which is deep rooted in the psyche of a nation which still has various atavistic responses. If we want to avoid civil war, someone has to gainsay this philosophy of armed struggle, but not, of course, the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, because if it undertakes to disarm the KLA, there will definitely be civil war. It is our duty to disarm the KLA, it is our duty to prohibit the KLA from using the security zone, it is our duty to tell the leadership in Kosovo not to incite the KLA to do these things, especially as we hold their purse strings – by the way, you could say the same to Turkey, that we shall stop all payments until they do something about the disgraceful state of their prisons – and, finally, we must use policing measures to prevent money from being collected in western Europe and sent to the KLA.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we do these things, the whole civilised approach argued by the Council representative – which of course we want – will be a waste of time. It is not just the responsibility of the Macedonians. Unless we do these things, we too shall be responsible for what happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
