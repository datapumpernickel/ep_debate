<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the</span> <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, when I was asked to make a statement on this topic, we did not know how tragically topical it would become. We are discussing this subject today in the shadow of the horrific terrorist attack in Bali on 12 October, in which more than 200 people lost their lives. It was a completely incomprehensible catastrophe, and has also underlined the fact that the terrorist threat must still be taken very seriously. We must not deceive ourselves – the fight against terrorism will be a very long and arduous task.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time I had the honour to speak to Parliament about terrorism was on 11 September this year, when together we remembered the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the USA. At that time, I emphasised that the USA had been targeted for attack because of its power, because of its insistence on Western-style democracy and on freedom and tolerance; but it could just as easily have been us who were hit. The terrorist attack in Bali, coming as it did out of the blue, has shown that no one is immune. The terrorists have distorted the many advantages of globalisation for the purposes of their inhuman and ruthless game. The fight against terrorism is a global one, in which close cooperation between the EU and the USA is an essential prerequisite for success.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus far been able to satisfy ourselves that, if it was the terrorists’ intention to break up Western democracies, they have achieved the exact opposite. We must let this thought guide us all in future. For this reason, too, the EU’s external role is a very important element in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">What, therefore, has the EU been doing since 11 September 2001, and how effective has it been?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s political reaction to last year’s catastrophe was very rapid and dynamic. First came a firm declaration from EU Heads of State and Government making it clear that the EU would do everything possible to ensure that those responsible were held to account and punished. The EU also stressed that the US Government and people could count on the full solidarity and cooperation of the EU in the continuing fight against terrorism. We shall not be moved on this. The EU did not stop at words. On 21 September, the Heads of State and Government adopted the plan of action which has become the backbone of the EU’s efforts. The list of results makes impressive reading.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key points on this list was the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation. Particular examples are the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the establishment of a common definition of acts of terror, and joint investigation teams. These are areas in which the EU has taken a quantum leap forward by swiftly adopting the necessary legal acts.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, agreement has been reached on a decision on the freezing of assets and evidence. This will establish rules on the way in which the Member States recognise and execute in their territories freezing orders issued by a judicial authority in another Member State. It will also make things harder for terrorists in the Member States. In addition, negotiations have been initiated with the USA on a cooperation agreement on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, and it is expected that an agreement between Europol and the USA on the exchange of personal data will be finalised by the end of the year. All things considered, it can be said that the EU has delivered all that could be expected of it – and more.</p>
<p class="contents">Another main point is putting an effective stop to the financing of terrorism. The necessary legal acts for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1373 were adopted as early as December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus stemmed the flow of money financing acts of terror, the lifeline without which international terrorism cannot survive.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a number of important initiatives have been taken with regard to aviation safety.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, we have reason to be pleased and proud about our handling of the fight against terrorism. It has become harder to exist as a terrorist and perpetrate acts of terror in Member States and has made it safer and more secure for our citizens. Can we rule out the possibility of future terrorist attacks? No, we cannot, but for this very reason we must continue the fight with renewed energy. This means not only continuing to round up terrorists, wherever they may be, but also providing targeted assistance in the quest to remove the underlying causes adding fuel to the terrorists’ fire.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we put legal certainty for our citizens on the line? For us, the politicians, it is a fundamentally political dilemma: is it acceptable to restrict our freedom in order to protect ourselves against terrorism? Are our efforts to protect our freedom and safety resulting in the creation of a Big Brother society? Where do we draw the line? I believe that the famous liberal philosopher Karl Popper gave us some guidance when he said: ‘If we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.’ This is also the line I sense in Parliament’s motion for a resolution, which emphasises that it is necessary to be firm when it comes to preventing terrorists reaping gains from their atrocities. The Presidency is fully in agreement with the emphasis which the motion for a resolution places on the principle that there must be no rewards for terror.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have struck the right balance. At the same time, the Presidency does not deem it necessary for there to be any further substantial anti-terrorism initiatives within the EU at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency has made the fight against terrorism a top priority. The handling of the fight against terrorism has been mainly oriented towards the EU’s external role. At the same time, of course, we want to continue to work on the implementation of internal measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the objective of the Danish Presidency to achieve progress in integrating the fight against terrorism into all aspects of the EU’s foreign policy. On top of strengthening the EU’s international role by increasing the emphasis EU foreign policy places on combating terrorism and by means of a systematic evaluation of the contribution of third countries to the fight against terrorism, it is our ambition for the EU to become a standard-bearer in the UN and other international fora. Maintaining the international anti-terrorism coalition and cooperation with the USA are essential aspects. Other aspects are the conclusion of a general convention against terrorism and the universal implementation of the 12 existing international conventions on combating specific acts of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Conclusions of 22 July 2002 on the EU’s external action against terrorism opened a new chapter in the fight against terrorism. In its future agreements with third countries, the EU will take more account of the contribution of these countries to the fight against terrorism and conduct a more targeted and if necessary tougher political dialogue with third countries. It was also decided to identify specific measures with a view to helping third countries to fulfil their obligations under Security Council Resolution 1373 and to concentrate on a smaller number of countries with a view to initiating a pilot project in cooperation with the UN’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. This will mainly be aimed at countries which have the political will but not the ability to observe UN resolutions. In the latter areas, in particular, it is hoped that concrete results will have been attained by the end of the Danish Presidency in the form of the launch of one or two pilot projects.</p>
<p class="contents">An accurate and comprehensive assessment of the threat is, however, a prerequisite for being able to re-evaluate the substance of contractual relations with third countries from the point of view of entering into agreements, for being able to tighten up the political dialogue if necessary and for being able to assess the possible need for aid to third countries. It has therefore also been a high priority of the Presidency’s to prepare the necessary analysis of individual countries and regions. The work is making good progress, and we anticipate that the necessary analytical bases will soon be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We must send the message to our discussion partners in third countries that the way in which they handle the fight against terror will have a considerable influence on their relations with the EU. I am pleased, therefore, that this idea is expressed in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can certainly be proud of its efforts in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attack. We have put our own house in order in conformity with the UN resolutions, and we have done this in such a way that legal certainty for our citizens has been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is important to turn our gaze outwards and play the international role which is expected of us. We have to maintain the anti-terrorism coalition and intensive cooperation with our closest partners, the USA in particular: in this way we have hope of success. I therefore hope for the continuing support of Parliament for the line taken here and I would thank the two Commissioners for their cooperation in this field.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Haarder,<span class="bold"> </span>ladies and gentlemen, the recent tragic events in Indonesia are proof that terrorism, a mindless and cowardly crime, can still strike and inflict devastating consequences, despite the efforts, over the last year, of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">These events can only strengthen our belief that we must relentlessly combat this terror using all the resources available and from a global perspective. The European Union has a major role to play in this fight, as Minister Haarder has so skilfully illustrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Our response to terrorism is based on the determination to rapidly provide the European Union and its Member States with the resources to cooperate more effectively, and for this cooperation to be undertaken with full respect for our democratic principles, with a view to enhance both the protection of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it must be noted that the reason why the European Union’s reaction in the wake of the 11 September attacks was so swift is largely due to the synergy between our institutions, namely Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This synergy was equally evident in the implementation of an inter-pillar approach which was able to respond to the magnitude of the challenge posed by terrorism, whether it be international terrorism or terrorism within each of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to go back over the benefits that have already been gained from implementing the strategy that we adopted last year. I shall instead speak about the fact that, following the Commission proposals, the Union adopted a common definition of terrorism, harmonised the penalties applicable to acts of terrorism and created a European arrest warrant. These instruments are proving to be useful in the negotiations of the World Convention against Terrorism which is taking place within the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to police cooperation, considerable progress has been made in strengthening operational collaboration between the national anti-terrorism forces and Europol. This operational cooperation is sometimes not particularly obvious, but it exists and it has been much improved over the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can only welcome the efforts made to improve analytical capabilities, especially as far as Europol’s assessment of the terrorist threat is concerned, and particularly as regards the specific measures which have been taken to increase the amount of information provided to Europol, including the exchange between police forces and information services of the Member States, and to ensure that this tool for cooperation and analysis is improved and used more widely.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the European Parliament’s initiative, the Commission itself proposed to the Council to finance, from the Community budget, specific activities designed to provide Europol with the additional resources required to strengthen and coordinate the action of Member States in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the fight against the financing of terrorism in Europe is concerned, I note that work is continuing on the development of instruments which facilitate the freezing of assets and block the funds of terrorist organisations, and also in the area of mutual recognition which will make it possible to act upon instructions to freeze assets that are issued by a judiciary authority of one Member State in another Member State. In 2003, the Commission will undertake an assessment of the mechanisms adopted against financial crime and, in parallel, will put forward a proposal on freezing and confiscating funds of entities controlled by individuals involved in the financing of terrorist activities. This is to ensure that legitimate activities cannot be used to finance terrorism. The protection of our external borders has also been the subject of intense work and of some initial innovative proposals, which some consider to be audacious, but which, in my view, are perfect for weighing up the many challenges that the Union must be prepared to face in order to safeguard its stability and domestic security.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to matters beyond our own borders, and without going into too much detail with regard to our actions, as Commissioner Patten will come back to this subject, our cooperation with the United States deserves a particular mention. The agreement on strategic cooperation between Europol and the United States, which provides for the exchange of strategic information and liaison officers, is a good example of this cooperation. We are currently working to extend this cooperation at police level by means of cooperation at judiciary level within the framework of Eurojust. The agreements currently being negotiated, whether they relate to the exchange of personal data, extradition or mutual assistance, will also play a crucial role. The Commission welcomes the fact that the mandates issued by the Council enforce the guarantee of the full respect of our values and our principles of law through these future cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us reiterate, however, assuming that this is necessary: what is currently at stake in the fight against terrorism is not only the protection of our principles, it is, first and foremost, the protection of our fellow citizens as well as the guarantee, in times of misfortune, that solidarity can be demonstrated. I will also point out that, last week, the Commission proposed that all victims of crime and terrorism in the European Union will be compensated for the personal injury and losses that they have suffered, and that a minimum standard will be determined with regard to this compensation. Solidarity and prevention are also at the heart of the very practical initiatives taken in the area of air safety and civil protection in order to improve coordination and cooperation between Member States, including issues relating to public health and the protection of public facilities essential for community life, such as water supply or electricity or nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, on 27 and 28 October, a European civil protection exercise will simulate the consequences of a terrorist attack involving radiological and chemical materials, in order to test the new surveillance and information centre established by the Commission. These considerable efforts must not and will not stop there, however. The prevention and the fight against terrorism require, more than ever before, the strengthening of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. This is one of the major challenges of our work within the Convention on the future of Europe. The Commission will put forward proposals for institutional reform so that the Union has all the resources necessary to contend with, in a diligent and effective manner, the challenges we currently face and, above all, the challenges that the future holds.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I welcome the chance to contribute to this debate. As both the President-in-Office and my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, have said, recent events in Indonesia show clearly that the threat to the international community from terrorist attacks is still very real – despite the enormous amount of work we have undertaken in the last year in an effort to counter that threat. Our sympathy and condolences go out to all those who suffered bereavement and horrendous injury in Bali. We think in particular of our friends in Australia and promise them that we will be exploring ways in which we can work closely with them to confront terrorism in all its manifestations. We will shortly be sending a high-level troika to Indonesia to discuss the contribution we can make to this campaign. That troika will be going on to Australia to ensure that we can involve ourselves as fully as possible, working in cooperation with the Australians as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have been at the forefront of the international effort to combat terrorism. Our actions in the immediate aftermath of 11 September demonstrate a point I have made in the context of the debate on the effectiveness of the European Union's foreign and security policy: when the political will is there, we can take effective action regardless of the institutional architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">Within days of the attack on America, a series of concrete measures was tabled by the European Commission. This led to a Plan of Action adopted, as has been said, by a special European Council on 21 September. A week later the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 – a truly landmark resolution setting out for the first time a clear set of actions which all Member States must follow to combat terrorism. And I say 'must' advisedly. It is a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that it is mandatory. It is a mark of the strength of international outrage following the 11 September attacks that such a resolution could be adopted with universal support.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's action plan is not cast in stone. We have adapted it to reflect new realities, including the adoption of Resolution 1373. We have also prepared a 'road map' setting out the means of implementing the action plan. We have taken practical steps at Union level to outlaw terrorist organisations and cut off their funding, as previous speakers have said. My colleague has just outlined the significant steps taken on police and judicial cooperation, border security and other internal questions.</p>
<p class="contents">But all such measures to combat terrorism can only be truly effective if they are applied everywhere – if there are no hiding places left for terrorists and their sources of funding dry up. The new challenge now before us is, therefore, to help those countries which cannot – for reasons of institutional weakness, lack of expertise or lack of financial resources – fully implement Resolution 1373 themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Here the European Union clearly has a crucial role to play. Much of the work which needs to be done is in areas where the European Union has built up an enormous amount of expertise through its programmes such as Phare, Tacis, Meda and CARDS. I am thinking here of the work we are already doing, helping our partner countries establish effective law enforcement institutions, improve border management and fight money-laundering. In addition to the work under way, the European Council conclusions of 22 July asked us to consider what more we could do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just agreed a strategy, endorsed by the Council at Coreper on 3 October, of identifying pilot countries where we judge there is a clear need for help and we feel the Commission has a comparative advantage. We are looking at the possibilities for action in countries of high importance in the fight against terrorism: in Central Asia, South and South-East Asia and the Gulf. We hope to send missions to some of these countries very soon to work up concrete projects, notably in the area of terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also incorporated the fight against terrorism into all aspects of our external relations. We are systematically evaluating our relationships with third countries in the light of the support those countries might give to terrorism. In this context, we are examining where counter-terrorism cooperation elements can be added to, or form part of new agreements, as has been the case in our association agreements with Lebanon, Algeria and Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is worth remembering that our external action goes wider than political dialogue. The European Union is a massive provider of development assistance. We provide about 55% of total international assistance and as much as two thirds of all grant aid. This is an often forgotten contribution to international security in its widest sense. Poverty and environmental degradation do not cause or justify terrorism. Nor are the poor more wicked than anyone else. But just as poor people are the major victims of crime in rich societies, so political instability and violence are more prevalent in the poorest countries. Nowhere is this clearer than in failed or failing states. If we are to deny Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks the territory from which to plan future atrocities, we must do all we can to bolster weak or failing states.</p>
<p class="contents">Our action in Afghanistan is a case in point. The European Union is the main donor helping to rebuild this shattered country. The Community alone has pledged over EUR 1 billion from the budget over the next five years, involving a substantial contribution to the operating costs of the new government, including salaries for police, nurses, doctors, teachers and civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we have done so far in the fight against terrorism. But I want to close with the thought that we can take a wide or a narrow view of counter-terrorist action. The narrow view focuses exclusively on terrorists and terrorist acts, on tracking down the former and preventing or punishing the latter. But there is a wider view too: our actions must be seen in the context of our unswerving support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We have a wide range of instruments at our disposal to tackle the root causes of terrorism, both in terms of poverty and economic development, and of institution building and the rule of law. It is here that our contribution to the fight against terrorism will have the most impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against terrorism is not like a conventional military campaign. It is unlikely to have a beginning, a middle and a glorious end, with surrender documents and peace treaties. It will go on and on, in many different shapes and forms, a few thousand terrorists against the whole of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier the President-in-Office quoted from Karl Popper's <span class="italic">The Open Society and Its Enemies</span>. I suspect that, for our generation, it was almost as important a document in shaping our attitudes as any by the great political philosophers. When Karl Popper wrote the words quoted, he was referring to the enemy of totalitarianism – a much clearer enemy. In response to that, drawing on other political philosophers like Burke, he argued that, to some extent, liberty had to be limited in order to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a different problem today. The ability to deliver terrorist assaults on free societies is much easier in open societies. The only way to make terrorism absolutely impossible is by a sort of global Orwellianism, which would itself provoke from liberals, like the President-in-Office and myself, the sort of assault others might regard as terrorist. We have a real paradox here. That is why it is so important that open societies and liberal democracies, without losing their values, work together comprehensively, cooperatively and intelligently.</p>
<p class="contents">To prosecute the campaign against terrorism will require international cooperation of unprecedented breadth and depth: political cooperation, economic cooperation and security cooperation. The European Union must play its part in those efforts – vigorously, generously and creatively – a key partner, I hope, in a well-planned and resolutely pursued campaign of multilateral engagement.</p>

These resolutions, to which the groups have now tabled amendments, were prepared by two committees. I do not think it right or proper that my colleague from the other committee is not also heading the list of speakers. I ask that the list of speakers be amended to enable my colleague to be given the floor after me, and to be followed by speakers from the groups. I do not believe that anyone from the other groups has any objection to this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed symbolic that the issue of terrorism should be dealt with by these two committees. The fact that the group's amendments refer to work we did and presented together makes it clear that we are dealing here with something completely new, the need for the fight against the cancerous growth of terrorism to be the common cause in which internal and external security unite. No longer can traditional methods of policing and repressive measures within states bring us success, nor can this situation be got round by traditional military means any more. A new definition of security policy is now called for, one that leaves no doubt that we are dealing here with a problem that knows no frontiers. No longer does the antagonist stand behind a fixed border; now he is within our own frontiers. He is mainly within borders that protect him, because he is there to prepare himself to do something in another country, which means that borders no longer separate us from the enemy but protect him. It is for this reason that we have to develop new methods, and today we are endeavouring to put forward a number of proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">What is in any case quite clear in all this is that there is a need for cooperation in all military and internal security matters on the part of the armed forces, the security services and the secret services, by which information may be gained as to how to take action against terrorism. It is wholly unacceptable for citizens to be killed in our States through the nation states' unwillingness to exchange information.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that, however important the steps taken in the aftermath of 11 September, only a part of what was discussed at the time has become reality. Commissioner Patten made particularly explicit reference to the terrible event in Bali, which has again demonstrated the way in which incidents of this kind will continue to proliferate. It must be made clear, though, that they can be successfully combated only if we respect the rule of law, including international law. We may not ourselves respond by breaking the law, but we must be in a position to be ready for action while at the same time guaranteeing the rule of law and international law. Hence the complicated situation we are in, which has to do with the United Nations and the role played by the Security Council. The primary and most important function of the Security Council is to be a way ahead in external policy matters, but it cannot be the only way.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it right that we should be speaking here in terms of a general convention against terrorism. I also believe that it has to be made clear that the killing of civilians in terrorist acts can be justified neither by religion nor by poverty nor by anything else. There can be no excuse for terrorism – no excuse whatsoever!</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the latest 2002 barometer published by the Commission indicates that six months after 11 September more than two out of three European citizens considered that the fight against terrorism was a matter that should be addressed at European Union level rather than at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighteen months later, however, do the European Union and the Member States still deserve this trust? That is the context in which today’s debate should be considered. We are meeting to debate the progress made by the European Union in the tough fight against terrorism and its future strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the intensive work and efforts carried out, the time has come to stop and think: what have we achieved? Where have we failed? And consequently, what are the next steps we should take? Certainly an enormous amount of work has been carried out. We should think about the adoption of the action plan in the fight against terrorism, the approval in record time of a common definition and penalties, and the arrest and surrender warrant, in addition to the establishment – as has already been said here – of Eurojust and the revitalisation of Europol. Nevertheless, we must be honest, not only with ourselves, but also with our citizens. Faced with the reality and current state of the terrorist threat, many European measures are still only theoretical.</p>
<p class="contents">The 11 September attacks brought to light all the obstacles to the full creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. In the event of another crisis situation, do you believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the citizens of Europe, and, to a greater extent, the victims of terrorism and their families, would be satisfied if we explained that the lack of effectiveness of the reaction of the European Union is due to its very architecture comprising pillars, the difficulty of adopting decisions unanimously, the attitudes of certain Member States, the refusal to exchange data with Europol? I sincerely doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">September 11 made us realise that the European Union is not fully adapted to the new world context. I am going to highlight three fundamental aspects. The first is that terrorism aims to destabilise the Rule of Law. Our task must therefore be to reinforce the content and legitimacy of European legislation. Today there is only one way of doing this: approving the work of the Convention on the future of the European Union to communitarise every aspect of the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice and subject them to the same rules of democratic and jurisdictional control.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of terrorism is to foster conflict between citizens of the same community. We must take into account the fact that terrorism is not just the person who plants a bomb or fires a gun, but that it also involves an infrastructure, financial means, legal advice, information on possible objectives and places to take shelter. The repulsion felt by society itself towards all those who use crime and threats is therefore a fundamental aspect of the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, terrorism takes advantage of the opening-up of our societies to cause as much harm as possible. The terrorists take advantage of the eradication of physical borders and the remaining legal and police borders between the Member States, and it is therefore vital to progress in the creation of this space to prevent it from being abused through the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee I have the honour of chairing, we shall continue to give the same attention to the results of the application of the action plan against terrorism and the future strategy of the Union. We also reserve the right to inform Parliament should we see that the Union’s commitment against terrorism is weakened or if the disputes between authorities or governments endanger the safety of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my political group, I would like to highlight and record here that the speed at which decisions have been taken by the European Union since 11 September must be a sign of political will and the great things it can achieve. I would remind you of this because, one year on, we are worried to see that the application of these decisions is not taking place as quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We need political will, but – and I reiterate the words of the chairman of my committee – we also need new procedures that will enable us to fulfil the citizens’ demands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention needs to address this issue and propose the necessary amendments in order to achieve a single structure that covers the area of internal justice. And this, which may appear to be incomprehensible Community jargon, means things such as being able to have a coherent legal basis – which we do not have at the moment – to be able to freeze the assets of terrorists operating within the European Union, and being able to resolve matters such as Europol. I would like to ask the Council whether, once again, we are going to allow Parliament to allocate a Community budget to Europol, and if we are going to allow that budget to remain pro memoria, without spending it, and how much longer we will be able to explain this to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you directly whether you are prepared to work towards an operational Eurojust, towards solving problems such as differing levels of data protection. I hope that you are and that you will fully involve Parliament in this work, as you did in reacting to 11 September, thereby showing this to be positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that these measures cannot be separated from other measures designed to reinforce our society’s defence. Defence of the Rule of Law, increased citizen confidence in the institutions, democratic dialogue, great care to avoid racism and xenophobia, respect and compensation for victims – and in this regard I welcome the Commissioner’s proposal – and also a foreign policy based on these principles: strength in the fight against terrorism, strength also in the establishment of conditions that allow us to address at source situations of instability which are extremely dangerous for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would also like to ask you how the negotiations with the United States on cooperation in this field are going. I would also like to ask you whether you are going to inform Parliament of the progress of these negotiations and their result, and whether you are going to take account of Parliament’s resolution of last December in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, nobody in Europe will understand that words such as unanimity, blockage, pillars, etc., slow down our cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure greater freedom for our citizens by safeguarding cooperation between the Member States in pursuit of greater effectiveness.</p>

There can be no tolerance of the intolerant. That said, we have more work to do to win hearts and minds in projecting a vision of Europe and the United States as beacons of human rights, non-discrimination, respect for difference and understanding of criticism. It is a paradox that young people in Africa and Asia gaze longingly at the American way of life while damning the United States as the 'great Satan'.</p>
<p class="contents">We must show, for instance, that we understand the difference between religion that is moderate, reasonable and compassionate and the dogmatic fundamentalism that exists in all religions, not just Islam. But we must make a special effort to keep up a dialogue with Muslims and include them in European societies. We must demonstrably treat others as we wish our own citizens to be treated. Would it not have been a magnificent gesture and morally right to have offered to airlift out all the local victims of the Bali bomb, to show that we were not just looking after rich white westerners? Maybe it is still not too late to do something.</p>
<p class="contents">The international fight against terrorism inevitably overlaps with the question of combating weapons of mass destruction. We are all conscious of the present developments regarding Iraq. The danger is that any pre-emptive action in the form of a war of conquest geared to regime change will leave the United States looking like an imperialist power in the Middle East. The backlash could create a whole new <span class="italic">cause célèbre </span>for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure openness and respect for liberty and democracy in the adoption of anti-terrorism measures, but in the 30-page terrorism roadmap you will only find Parliament mentioned four times. The Council is negotiating agreements on mutual legal assistance, extradition and exchange of personal data with the United States, involving Europol-FBI cooperation. In principle, that is fine, but there is no democratic or judicial scrutiny. Although the subject matter is justice and home affairs, where there is normally some parliamentary input, external agreements are negotiated without parliamentary scrutiny. This is unsatisfactory and weakens our claim to be defending liberty and democracy.</p>

There are many fine words on safeguarding democracy and guaranteeing civil rights, and on the prevention of civil crises. The truth is, however, that we currently find ourselves in a crucial situation, in which the EU must make up its mind whether it wishes to follow the USA blindly, irrespective of what the latter may come up with in relation to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth addressing some of the concerns which my fellow Member, Baroness Ludford, expressed about pre-emptive strikes. We start to have a problem if we use these pretty words but act differently, and here I am thinking of civil rights in particular. The resolution gives its full approval for the EU’s anti-terrorism package, and that includes the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. We are therefore currently faced with a topical problem, namely that the National People’s Army and the Communist Party of the Philippines have presumably ended up on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations along with their leader José Maria Sison, who is incidentally in exile in the Netherlands. The problem is that these groups constitute a quite crucial part of the network involved in peace negotiations in the Philippines. This is incidentally a process which has been under way for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, Parliament has adopted two resolutions which actively support this process, and I think Mr Haarder even voted for one of them. Now we are in the process of putting a vital player in a peace process on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. If that does not go completely against all of the pretty words on crisis prevention, I do not know what does. We are creating a problem, and I would advise Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder to re-read their Popper. There continue to be totalitarian regimes, to which resistance must be offered; and if we in the EU are unable to tell the difference between terrorists and freedom fighters, it is a very sad world for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like a definitive answer to the following questions: is it true that Sison, the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines are to be included on the EU’s list of terrorists? Is it true that, in so doing, we are busy dooming the whole of this peace process to failure? Has anyone given any consideration to how these fine words can be reconciled with the harsh reality? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, this association with violence is justified where terrorism is concerned, but it is not justified, and should not be, when it comes to the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament has managed to reach consensus about a predominantly non-violent fight against terrorism. Let me mention a few elements: terrorism is not a natural phenomenon but also has economic and social roots, and that is precisely where the EU's programmes could provide value-added. As Commissioner Patten mentioned a moment ago, the most effective strategy for fighting terrorism is conflict prevention. Military action can only be legitimised by and via the United Nations. These are all elements which my group very much applauds because they are the key elements of the non-violent fight against terrorism. Add to this the concern about the US's unilateralism and the rejection of so-called pre-emptive strikes, the strong emphasis on the protection of fundamental civil rights and the recognition of the need to lay down minimum standards in the field of criminal law, and I think it is right to say that what is being presented in this resolution is a balanced inventory of causes and possible actions. As far as I am concerned, this is a European view of terrorism, not necessarily compared to an American view of terrorism, but as a basis for an even-handed dialogue on terrorism between equals.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do have to ensure, though, is that this balanced, paper vision is not imbued with a practice that remains governed by oppression and military means. I am convinced that only if the practice becomes as balanced as and is like this paper resolution, will we manage to fight terrorism successfully without creating new causes of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, reference is made in the resolution to Galileo, an intelligence, information and navigation system which the European Union is setting up. I have also re-read the debate on Galileo. In it, it is stated repeatedly that Galileo is, in principle, a civil system that is not, or should not be, used to collect military information, and my impression is that certainly the first generation of Galileo is absolutely unsuitable for collecting information of any nature whatsoever that could prove useful in the fight against terrorism. It is therefore somewhat beyond me, in all honesty, why Parliament is so keen to include this reference to Galileo. In my view, this mention is either premature, because Galileo as it currently stands cannot serve any purpose whatsoever, or the European Parliament has been misinformed in the past. Surely, Galileo is a so-called dual-use system, and these are two arguments why, in my view, the reference to Galileo in this terrorism resolution should be deleted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not possible to prevent and combat terrorism effectively while so many million people are living in a hopeless state of ignorance, poverty, political and economic stagnation and lack of freedom. Unfortunately, this is the way they will stay until the West intervenes.</p>
<p class="contents">European leaders, with the exception of Tony Blair and the Danish Government, live in the dishonest belief that the whole problem can still be solved from within if we contribute with diplomatic chatter, by playing ‘wait and see’ and criticising the USA in the hope that the terrorists will not really strike in a European city. No leader in the Arab world has been toppled by a popular uprising in the last 80 years, and nothing will change if we remain passive. Europe has simply come to where we were in 1938, when Chamberlain returned from his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich and proclaimed that there would be peace in our time.</p>
<p class="contents">I can fully understand that the USA may have difficulty in respecting us, as we do not dare back our many fine words up with force. Europe will not become a player by adopting who knows how many resolutions. We will only become one by developing our countries’ militaries to the same level as the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">The dictatorial regimes in the countries which produce terrorists and pay for terrorism do not enjoy popular support, but the peoples are so oppressed that they are unable to bring about the necessary revolution. If we mean anything by our professions of freedom and democracy, it is our duty to stand together with the USA in the showdown with the whole clutch of dictatorship states which are responsible for breeding terrorism. I would thank Minister Haarder for his clear emphasis on the need to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That day is the point of reference for the worldwide fight against so-called international terrorism. The Islamic driving forces behind the terrorist attack on this black Tuesday have now been sufficiently documented. This threat is continuing to this day, as is evidenced by the recent attacks in Indonesia and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore no doubt as to the urgency of the global fight against Islamic terrorism. Parliament's present joint motion for a resolution, however, is proving to be of little use in this context. First of all, the nature of the Islamic threat is insufficiently highlighted. The resolution does not go beyond offering possible solutions to counter the spreading of Islamism. This is not enough. We should take the nature of this threat much more seriously. More knowledge about the mental legacy of these terrorists is a primary requirement in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the resolution causes confusion. I would particularly refer to Paragraph 28 of the joint motion for a resolution which recommends the use of anti-terrorism clauses in agreements between the EU and third countries as instruments to fight terrorism. Who could be opposed to this? The point is, however, that an association agreement with the Republic of Lebanon, of all countries, is quoted by way of shining example – a state in which an Islamic terrorist movement, the Hezbollah, is a growing force to be reckoned with. This is also compounded by the close ties between Hezbollah and Syria and, above all, the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason I should very much like to hear from the Council and the Commission how the Lebanese Republic fits into the European strategy of a global fight against terrorism. I am really waiting for a reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid Islamic terrorism has already arrived on our doorsteps.</p>
<p class="contents">After 11 September, the United States, although undeniably bound up in what is, not least, a political web of interests with the oil-producing countries, attacked without hypocrisy the issue of fundamentalist terrorism, declaring out and out war on the many-headed hydra of Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, however, we have to record a less-highly charged atmosphere. Evidence of this is, not least, the language people use and the way they find it difficult to use the words ‘Islamic’ or ‘Islamic fundamentalist’ in conjunction with the word ‘terrorism’. It would seem that Europe wants to play down the contribution to terrorism of certain Arab and Islamic countries such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, the Sudan, Iran and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking just now, Mr Belder mentioned the Lebanon, and he was right to do so, for three reasons. Firstly, this is an attempt to obtain neutral status and to delude ourselves that, in this way, we can avoid terrorist action in our own territory. Secondly, this is an attempt to safeguard business relations. Thirdly, it is an attempt to maintain constant energy supplies. These are three extremely clear motives: fear, money and oil. Europe appears to be hiding, for these reasons, from a danger which, it must be stressed, has already penetrated its borders. Only a few days ago in my country, a magistrate specialising in combating terrorism – Gerardo D’Ambrosio – condemned the presence of between 1500 and 2000 warriors of Allah in our country alone. The Antimafia Commission has condemned the collusion between the Mafia and terrorism on a number of occasions: in my country, the Mafia organisation, the Camorra, regularly supplies terrorists with false documents. In its motion for a resolution, the European Union rejects any attempt to defend or justify terrorism. That is a perfect description of the behaviour during the days immediately following 11 September of at least 100 <span class="italic">imam</span> in 100 Mosques or Islamic centres, particularly the famous centre in London.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to clamp down on such attitudes and behaviour and bring to justice the people, groups and organisations which promote terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No distinction should be made between national and international terrorism because, in the world in which we live, terrorism is global and the Member States alone do not have the capacity to combat it effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it should be recognised that, since the tragic attacks of 11 September 2001, we have made considerable progress at European and international level in combating this scourge. It is not, therefore, appropriate today to make a declaration on our commitment to the fight against terrorism – which is a given – but it is appropriate to debate with the Commission and the Council the practical measures adopted, the effectiveness of their implementation in all the Member States, and, above all, what more we can and must do.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to accomplish this, we must use, as a framework, the action plan that has already been adopted and, as an objective, the necessary transfer to the Convention on the future of the European Union of the mandate to develop the third pillar and continue to extend the Community legal basis in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I am briefly going to talk about a few ideas which, at the proposal of my group, have been included in the common resolution upon which we are to vote tomorrow, as they are in keeping with the role of driving force which the European Parliament has been playing, even since before the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prioritise the adoption of new rules that protect the victims of terrorism, harmonising national legislations and – why not? – creating a Community instrument to protect victims. We also need to introduce democratic clauses into association and partnership agreements signed by the European Union with third countries – the agreement we are shortly to sign with Lebanon can set a precedent – and we must adopt shared measures between the Member States which avoid instrumentalising the democratic framework to the benefit of both terrorists, directly, and their necessary accomplices and collaborators, indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the scope of current legislation, and within the scope of the Rule of Law, the European Union must always be vigilant in the face of any attempt to justify recourse to violence, because there is no such thing as good and bad terrorists.

I think this is a good time to take stock of the progress that has been made in the fight against international terrorism, but also of the guiding principles on which this progress should be based. Recent events, including the terrible disaster which took place in Bali a few weeks ago, show that the threat is still very much present.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question with regard to the EU's policy is, of course, to what extent all the combined measures taken have contributed to a decrease in the risk of terrorism. Would the Commission and the Council be able to comment on this? The European Parliament would like to be informed more frequently and more effectively about the implementation of the action plan. Our grassroots support needs this. I appreciate that much of the information is sensitive, but a comprehensive overview of the activities does not give us a direct insight into the policy's effectiveness. Are we really managing to drive back terrorist networks?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's motion for a resolution devotes a great deal of attention to the role of the United Nations in the fight against international terrorism, and rightly so. This role is crucial. We want an international approach to an international problem based on collective security, which means that action should be taken via the UN Security Council and not unilaterally or along with occasional coalitions. This is not only a question of principle, it is also desirable in view of the need to create the widest possible support for the fight against international terrorism. Fighting the root cause of terrorism is the most effective way of tackling this phenomenon's breeding ground. We would like to see aspects such as the promotion of democracy and the fight against poverty playing a clear role in this. The policy should not be confined to military or police operations. The European Union has, like no other, the complete bandwidth of instruments required for this at its disposal. We are, in fact, talking about a form of conflict prevention, which is surely the EU's general priority in its foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the special problem that has already been mentioned by Commissioner Patten, namely the problem of the so-called failed states.<span class="italic"> </span>These can mainly be found in Africa, but also closer to home, like Transdniestria, the break-away section of Moldavia, for example. These countries, or regions, offer an excellent home and operating base for criminals and terrorist activities, two things that often go hand in hand. The European Union should, I believe, adopt a more pro-active stance, particularly in the case of a few regions closer to home – one of which I mentioned a moment ago – and not leave the solution of the Transdniestria problem, for example, to other countries and organisations alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are of the view that the European Union could easily be a little more ambitious in its thoughts about its role in the fight against terrorism when it comes to the deployment of the new instruments of the common foreign and security policy in combating terrorism. In the exceptional circumstances we are facing, we need to ask ourselves whether there are any tasks in addition to those of Petersberg. This would also fit in with our more general view that our activities to fight terrorism should take place more at EU level than at national level. If the EU joins forces, this will pay dividends at UN level too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorism is not a new phenomenon in itself. It was not ‘invented’ on 11 September 2001. On the other hand, global terrorism with a worldwide network, high-tech weapons and apparently inexhaustible economic resources is a new and extremely frightening phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">The attacks in New York and Bali made it clear to everyone that the fight against terrorism must be carried out at global level, in the form of police and judicial cooperation, intelligence and investigations. However, it is also important to engage in long-term, preventive cooperation to eradicate, or at least minimise, the causes of terrorism. Democracy is the best antidote to terrorism. The international alliance must therefore prioritise massive efforts to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Trade, aid and cooperation in international organisations are also important. In the fight against terrorism, peace in the Middle East would be an extremely important contribution to the jigsaw.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party fully realises the need for increased cooperation in order to combat terrorism. A good deal has been done; a good deal more can be done. We must, however, bear in mind that the chief target of the terrorists is the open society. That is why we must not, in our eagerness to combat terrorism, undermine the heart of democracy. The rule of law must never be sacrificed on the altar of our drive to act. Special rules, military tribunals and unclear reasons as to why an individual or group has found its way onto a certain list are unacceptable. It is scandalous that the prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay base are still in legal limbo. I should like to ask the Council what is being done to obtain a clear picture of, in particular, the situation of the European citizens in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you quoted from Karl Popper’s <span class="italic">The Open Society and its Enemies</span>. We must not become enemies of the open society ourselves.

Led by the Bush Administration, the various European governments are in the process of developing a real arsenal to curb freedom. It is now common to draw parallels between immigrants, young people, delinquents and terrorists. This is essentially what the far-right trades on.</p>

<p class="contents">We are still opposed to any action which seeks to terrorise a nation, whether this be a sort of private terrorism such as that waged by Osama Bin Laden or state terrorism by Ariel Sharon. We will not stamp out this scourge by restricting democratic freedoms but rather by eradicating its sources, namely poverty and oppression.

<p class="contents">I do not need, either on behalf of my group or on behalf of my own Galician political organisation, to reiterate my categorical rejection and condemnation of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to emphasise that the resolution requires the creation of conditions to combat terrorism within the context of absolute respect for the law and human rights, both through the eradication of poverty and marginalisation, and through the fight against fundamentalist ideology, which – even more than poverty – is often given as the main justification for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to highlight three specific issues. First of all, I believe it is necessary to talk about a practical policy and reject – as the resolution also does to some extent – the militarist unilateralism of the United States and its doctrine of pre-emptive action which contravenes all international rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it should be highlighted that the US is preparing to take action against another country, which is governed by a dictatorship, an ideology which we clearly do not share; on the other hand, it has hardly been able to arrest anybody in relation to the September 11 attacks. Anybody at all. Twenty people were involved in these attacks in the US and nobody has been arrested in direct relation to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to the problem in the Middle East. It seems to me that we all agree that the problem of Palestine is at the root of international terrorism, and in any case, it is apparently the justification for this terrorism. There is no question of solving this as if it were a religious problem; it concerns a State, regardless of its professed religion, against a colonised nation, regardless of its professed religion.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should pay great attention to this issue. Until the problems between Israel and Palestine are solved, if peace is not promoted and the Palestinian State created, it will be difficult to combat a fundamental part of the apparent justification for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall end by saying this: the fight against terrorism cannot – as the resolution says – become a fight against political groups which use peaceful means with a view to changing the political and social structure, such as, for example, what is happening in the Spanish State and in Europe in general. And frequently the necessary dialogue is not promoted, not only between political groups, but also between different institutions which are affected and which suffer the effects of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the 1960s and 1970s Europe faced the violence of Communist-inspired extremist movements such as the ‘Red Brigades’ or the Baader-Meinhof Gang. Today, it is extremist organisations such as Al Qaeda that represent the destruction of modernity. They believe themselves to be justified in using violent means to bring down the reigning democratic orders, and believe that they are involved in an all-out war, designed to protect Islam from Western hegemony and to impose it on the infidels, as they call them, who do not share these views, attacking even moderate Muslim countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are other motives for terrorist activity, of a political, nationalist or separatist nature, even on European soil, which we find equally repulsive but which are today, unfortunately, outweighed by this predominant form of terrorism, which is especially dangerous because it attacks anywhere, uses indiscriminate violence and believes itself to be unfettered by any moral or human constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the fact that, due to its liberality and its tradition of welcoming political exiles, Europe has become a place of refuge for numerous radical and terrorist groups. Despite its generous policy, these extremists sow the seeds of hate and take advantage of the facilities made available to them by the democratic systems, organise themselves, find funding, recruit new members and plot attacks against targets on our continent and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against terrorism as a truly transnational phenomenon, which could at any time imperil the rights, freedoms and guarantees that pertain to all of us must, therefore, be subject to a global Union and Member State strategy that, on its own, either within the United Nations or in cooperation with the United States within NATO, prevents and suppresses terrorist acts and, at the same time strengthens the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, the strategy of the Member States must be underpinned, as has already been said, by the effective use of all the mechanisms of judicial and police cooperation and information sharing, also strengthening an extended concept of security and defence that takes account of the need to confront this renewed international threat. We realise that the prevention and suppression of terrorism can also involve the promotion of dialogue between civilizations and the adoption of effective policies to combat social, economic or cultural factors, which, although they cannot by any means justify terrorist violence, are systematically exploited and used by terrorist activists. It is, Mr President, on the basis of these principles of the unity of ideas in the fight against terrorism, which obviously outweigh the differences we have with some of the conclusions of the joint motion for a resolution that we are discussing, that we shall support this motion and vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must admit however that there is something particularly silly about the problem that currently occupies us, an issue known by the expression the ‘fight against terrorism’. This expression and the very word ‘terrorism’ were in fact pretty poor choices to describe an obvious fact, namely that the policy conducted by what we agree to call ‘the international community’, that is, of course, the United States and its accomplices, the imperial powers, is increasingly fiercely contested throughout the world, so that we end up, as do all empires in fact, giving the label ‘terrorism’ to something that could just as well be called resistance; Mr Krivine illustrated this point very well earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am certainly not condoning acts which target innocent people, even though, in a democracy, I am aware, no one is completely innocent. Let us not dwell on that, however. It goes without saying that I utterly condemn the attacks of 11 September, as well as the recent attack in Bali, just as I condemn the recent attack on a French petrol tanker, or less recently, in 1995, the attacks on the Paris underground system, and this leads me, once again, to condemn the fact that the person who committed these crimes is able to find refuge, even today, in one of the Member States of the European Union, a country basically acting as if it were an accomplice to these crimes. This goes to show that nothing is simple.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains, ladies and gentlemen, and this is fundamental, that we are not a tribunal. We cannot say what is good and what is evil. We must take a candid look at the world today, the state it is in and we will not fool anyone for long by suggesting that what passes as the West has only one enemy, Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda and its presumed ramifications. In fact, those who we call terrorists exist the world over; their numbers are on the increase and they are becoming more radical even as the empire steps up its increasingly violent domination against the populations whose values and secrets it disregards and which it demonises, even though they are obviously in a different category in military terms.</p>
<p class="contents">There will never be peace between rich people who are too rich and too arrogant, and poor people who are too poor and too humiliated. It is a fact of life, ladies and gentlemen, that any empire which cannot grow and cope with excessive ambitions and the arrogance of power without having recourse to violence will inevitably bring about rebellions; it is another fact of life that the rebellion of oppressed people is violent, mindless and savage and nothing could be more serious for us, the nations of Europe, who are familiar with history, than to become embroiled in a problem which, under the pretext of combating terrorism, could lead us to feel widespread mistrust towards the developing world which represents, I would point out, three quarters of the peoples of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is true in this report too. In the past, we actually assumed that terrorism was mainly a problem that affected unstable countries rather than apparently peaceful states. We have had to review our opinions completely, because we now know that terrorism also flourishes in peaceful countries such as mine, the Netherlands – albeit not in a violent manner; terrorists are careful about this. Instead, as the Commissioner has already stated, they use the free and open society with its facilities to quietly prepare terrorist acts which they commit elsewhere. This is why the European Union and also its very peaceful Member States will need to be very much on the alert so as to fight terrorism in their own countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, not all categories of citizens in the Member States will be faced with a threat of the rule of law. Sometimes it is only certain categories of citizens who are targets for extortion in our countries by fellow nationals collecting money for terrorist acts in places like northern Africa. There are certain categories of citizens in the Netherlands and in other Member States who are victims of such extortion, and we must fight for people in that position, so that the rule of law is no longer under threat for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of terrorism are often sought in poverty. I do not actually believe that this is so. It is a well-known fact that revolutions are not staged by the extremely poor; those involved are often people of a different type. This is also the case here. Those responsible for the serious attacks were well-educated, well-to-do people who were perfectly able to fit into any developed society, including Western society, and could even have achieved high status there. The problem is often that people's most vulnerable part, their deepest convictions, are taken advantage of and that the evil seed of violent terrorism is sown in the very growth cell of the social organism. There is always a handful of people who are susceptible to this. It is not necessarily down to fundamentalism; there is a huge number of peace-loving fundamentalists. A considerable leap is required to resort to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We were all shocked by the attacks on Bali. We should, in my view, make every effort to ensure that the Indonesian Government receives maximum support so that the state of Indonesia can be sufficiently strong to prevent and fight terrorism internally as much as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like others, I want to express my deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends of those who have died. I agree with most, though not all, of what has been said here. It is clear what needs to be done: respect for the rule of law, protection of rights, scrutiny of the action our states take to deal with terrorism, democratic dialogue to try and deal with underlying issues and so forth. All are very necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">What more can one add? It seems to me that one thing we can add is the notion that we are not going to destroy terrorism by simply killing or imprisoning those who carry out these acts. Of course, it is not the poor in general who carry out the acts but those responsible for the acts are often poor. We have to try and deal with the hopelessness that motivates them. We have to try and overcome the idea that there is one true faith, one true version of history and one version of truth expounded by the chosen ones. I am not speaking here just of religion but also of politics. We must try to engage with people, so that we can open their minds and our own to what underlies their hopelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to contain terrorism, although I have no doubt of the power of our states to do so. Not all the European Union Member States have experienced terrorism since the end of the Second World War, but a significant number have. That is quite extraordinary, considering that we are one of the most stable and peaceful regions in the world. We need to engage in education in the real sense, to open minds to the fact that the world is extremely diverse and could be a very tolerant and good place to live if we could only live with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now know, of course, that terrorists can strike anywhere in the world, and it has proved true that we must work together across borders and across the Atlantic to stamp out terrorism. We acted rapidly in Europe following 11 September: we can congratulate ourselves on this. We want to live in an area of security, freedom and justice, and the fight against international terrorism is the most important challenge on the foreign and security policy scene. Anyone who has been following the European debate on relations with the USA in recent months will have started to have misgivings about the imbalance and one-sidedness it has shown. We share a strong set of values with the USA. Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September of last year, I am sure many of us saw these as an attack on ourselves and our values. The USA and Europe are united by the fundamental values and principles of democracy and freedom and justice, of human rights and the right of individuals to achieve their potential. We must stand firm on this. Despite our differences of opinion, that which unites us is much stronger than that which divides us. We must exert our influence on the USA within the framework of a multilateral approach to the fight against international terrorism, something which knows no justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If, however, you turn on the mass media to which the citizens of Europe are listening, you will see that the main terrorist-related issue today is the question of the attack on Iraq, a country which is harbouring or is considered to be harbouring weapons of mass destruction which might be used to support terrorist and other activities. The European Union has literally become an international laughing stock in this Security Council procedure, what with the British Government secretly making proposals which are then tabled by the United States on the one hand and the French Government refusing to go along with the notion of unconditional intervention in Iraq on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Parliament should have taken a stand on these issues, but it has deliberately avoided doing so in the vague wording of this motion for a resolution which, I think, responds neither to the interests of the citizens of Europe nor to the demands of the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly although the largest terrorist attacks in the last year have taken place in New York and Bali, it would be interesting to consider what Europe’s response would have been if the original attack that drew our attention to the scale of terrorism, that of 11 September 2001, had taken place in Europe; if the aeroplanes, instead of flying into the twin towers in New York, had flown into the Eiffel Tower, the buildings of the European Parliament or any other major European building. Perhaps such self-examination would have given us a greater insight into the ambiguities and the difficulties we face in dealing with the phenomenon of terrorism, which we have not yet entirely renounced.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect that I should like to mention – in addition to praising the Council’s intention to maintain close cooperation with the United States in this field – is that, in fact, and this is an important point, terrorism has little to do with poverty. Poor people are clearly involved in terrorist actions, but those directing operations are not poor. And if we look at the world as a whole, the poorest people are not involved in the phenomenon of terrorism: Africa would be the main source of terrorist acts if a correlation really existed between terrorism and poverty. But this is not the case! Terrorism is a phenomenon that contains a political rationale requiring the achievement of certain aims and also requires a degree of power. And this does not, of course, come from the poorest, or at least not directly from the poorest.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to refer to something Commissioner Patten said, quoting Popper. The problem we face today is also one that Popper raised: it is not so much the tension between the need to preserve freedoms and our perception of what the security and defence of free society means, but our inability and unwillingness to believe in the moral superiority of democracy and of freedom. Furthermore, on the basis of this concept, which is fundamental to our civilisation and which is longed for by the peoples of the entire world, in particular the poor, perhaps we should be able and willing to act against terrorism. Unfortunately, some ambiguities in Europe today are preventing us from doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we all agree that terrorism has to be combated and we also all agree that this can only be done at international level, because terrorism has become an international issue. If we wish to combat terrorism at international level, however, we of course also need to take a critical look at ourselves. As the Budget rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee, on which we formerly sat together, Mr President-in-Office, it has come to my attention that we are faced with much petty squabbling. We want to fight terrorism and to do so we need a European police force, Europol, and a successful authority, such as Eurojust. I now note, however, that although we in the European Parliament have already made as much as EUR 2.8 million available for Eurojust, for example, this money cannot be spent because our European authorities are not able to operate effectively for national, petty reasons. If the national police forces are not prepared to cooperate with Europol and if the national ministries of justice are not prepared to support Eurojust, then we can carry on getting up on our soapboxes to say how important it is to fight terrorism, but we will never succeed in doing so because it is preventive action that is needed. To be able to take preventive action we also need functioning authorities, and we will only achieve this if the national countries, the 15 Member States of the European Union, finally make it possible for our authorities, such as Europol and Eurojust, to act. I should therefore like to ask you, Mr Haarder, and also Commissioner Vitorino, to convey this point repeatedly and clearly to the Member States in the Council; otherwise success will elude us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, I note that Members were basically positively disposed towards the anti-terror legislation and voted in favour of it. This does not, however, in any sense serve primarily to combat terrorist activities; above all it gives the EU greater powers to conduct investigations through, for example, the Schengen Information System II and the European arrest warrant. The effect of this qualitative and quantitative extension of the EU's powers is to introduce sweeping changes in fundamental rights, meaning in particular greater intervention by the modern civil state and a weakened right of defence for the accused, whoever they may be.</p>
<p class="contents">The completely arbitrary definition of terrorism provides the clearest indication of all that the war on terror has little to do with combating terrorism and instead has as its primary objective the erosion of fundamental rights in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I strongly asserted that the alliance should prepare itself to intervene in the Balkans or otherwise it would, eventually, cease to exist. Today, I can easily outline the argument that I put forward at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period following the end of the Cold War, the alliance had to be capable of intervening in the major crisis which was unfolding at the heart of Europe, otherwise European citizens would wonder what purpose it could still serve, and whether it was worthwhile continuing to invest a proportion of their taxes in it. It took two long years and the tragic fall of Srebrenica for this message to be understood. On 31 August 1995, however, by supporting the action of the UN reaction force deployed on the Igman mountain to put a stop to the Serbian batteries which had resumed their indiscriminate bombing of the city of Sarajevo, the UN played an essential part in resolving the crisis, enabling the signature of the Dayton Accords and the introduction of a lasting cease-fire. Since then, UN forces have been successfully deployed in Kosovo and more recently still in Macedonia, helping to restore calm to the area, although it has not resolved all the political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the same debate has started on the role that the Atlantic alliance could possibly play in the fight against international terrorism. The alliance is in crisis, illustrated by the fact that the Americans did not believe they should call upon its support in the war in Afghanistan. Does this unilateralism spell the demise of the alliance? I cannot believe so, since the Americans themselves would have pointed this out and expressed this desire.</p>
<p class="contents">The vocation of the alliance to this day is to intervene in European territory and neighbouring countries, wherever there is a potential threat against its values that Pacheco Pereira has just reiterated. International terrorism is one of these threats, and it is a major threat. To this end, the only way of reforming NATO and ensuring its survival is to construct, at long last, a Europe of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice is simple, either the European Union continues to leave the Americans to deal with military problems on its continent by being happy to play some minor role in resolving problems that threaten peace, much like the Athenians in ancient Rome, or it finally becomes their equal and shares the burden of defending itself against all the threats, which is what they have been asking us to do since the Atlantic Alliance was formed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all agreed on that. It is our opinions on methods for combating terrorism which perhaps differ.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach taken by the EU in developing its strategy for the fight against terrorism is extremely important. The rule of law and human rights must not be undermined in the process of carrying out this important fight. The resolution that the two committees are tabling jointly here is, therefore, an important one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has made its contribution by delineating the main instruments which the EU has at its disposal for the prevention of conflicts, for example the development of democracy, and also trade and diplomacy. It is of course crucial to get at the fundamental causes of terrorism, such as poverty, violations of human rights and oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the shadow of 11 September, there is a risk of fundamental human rights being neglected in the fight against terrorism. There is also a risk of the only superpower we have today taking unilateral liberties outside the United Nations system. It is extremely important, therefore, that Parliament upholds the United Nations Charter, and that the right of a state under attack to defend itself is only legitimate if confirmation is given or a decision taken by the UN Security Council. To start deliberating on the desirability of UN resolutions would directly undermine the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that we are unanimous in our view that a strategy based on pre-emptive strikes, which the US government wishes to avail itself of, is <span class="italic">not</span> an effective way of combating terrorism, and in emphasising that a settlement of the Middle East conflict in accordance with UN resolutions constitutes a very important element of the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">International law is a crucial element if we are to have a society based on the rule of law. This applies to smaller states in particular. Undermining the UN can only end in disaster. For this reason, it is crucial that the EU stands up for the UN and its charters, even in difficult times, and does not undermine the central role of the United Nations as the world’s peacekeeper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has reacted more quickly than ever before and I believe that in a relatively short period of time it has adopted some extremely efficient measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, still many more measures that we need to take. Our internal strategy has in any case been successful. What we need now is a successful external strategy. I should like to address a number of points here that seem to me to be necessary for extending and stepping up our cooperation with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we should extend the network that we have already formed to include Europol liaison officers and that we should use it for analysis purposes and for criminal prosecution, but also to provide support to third countries. What we need are better ways of channelling information into our files, not only in the Member States, but also from third countries into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should take another look at how we link the data files at our disposal so as to have more effective instruments available. I am thinking of the Europol data, the Schengen data and the Eurodac data.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that in some cases we are still working with extremely antiquated systems such as the fingerprint system. We must finally move over to using biometric systems so that we can determine identities with complete accuracy and take advantage of this in our screening processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must not only think in terms of cooperation with the USA, but should accept the offer and take the hand that is being extended to us by the Asian states and work together with them in the fight against terror.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself attended the last ASEP conference in Manila and we received magnificent offers for getting cooperation with the Asian states against terrorism off to a successful start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How has the EU reacted to this tragic event? It has demonstrated its solidarity and will to support the United States, it has alerted people to the risk of linking terrorism to the Islamic Arab world and has speeded up integration in the fight against terrorism by means of an action plan consisting of more than 60 measures and a series of framework decisions, including the European arrest warrant and police cooperation in the fight against terrorism. It has highlighted the urgent need to find political means to resolve conflicts on which terrorist fanaticism feeds, not least the Israeli-Palestinian question.</p>
<p class="contents">The determination to eradicate terrorism and the urgent need to set up new and effective instruments to achieve this cannot, under any circumstances, disproportionately affect individual rights, freedoms and guarantees. It is the affirmation of the intangibility of fundamental rights that underpins a public authority’s legitimacy to use force in democracies. By the same token, the relentless fight against the terrorist threat must be definitively limited under international law. Totalitarian societies hold the primacy of the law in contempt both at national level and in international relations. The concept of international legality is the invention of democracies. If the States that have fallen victim to terrorism react to this threat by breaching the rules and principles of international law, they will be giving the criminals an unexpected boost, which would also constitute a step backwards for civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fanatical hatred that leads human beings to attack others and to commit suicide is often fed by ongoing situations of injustice or humiliation. This fact must not be interpreted as any kind of justification for the odious attacks against civilian populations but as a factor that is crucial to understanding this phenomenon of violence. At the strictly European level, we must here emphasise and condemn the inability and lack of will persistently demonstrated by the governments of the Member States to follow up the proposal to harmonise policies and to create common instruments to combat terrorism that were put forward, in a timely manner, by the Commission. Terrorism is a threat that requires an integrated and supranational response. Within European territory, this response is still failing to give sufficient signs of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equally importantly, there should be no ambivalence about this evil.</p>
<p class="contents">But, regrettably, this is not always the case. When the United States justifiably initiates a global campaign against organisations responsible for terrorism and the regimes that sponsor it, it is important for us to remind them that they allied themselves to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein when it suited their foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, condemnation of terrorism rings hollow when they fail to take a strong line against the incidences of state terrorism committed by Israel, which have the potential to create future generations of terrorists in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as I would criticise the United States, I am not blind to the inconsistency of the EU on these issues – the Council in particular. For example, during the present global fight against terrorism we have, on occasions, turned a blind eye to the shortcomings of the undemocratic regimes we have enlisted to support us.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether for geopolitical reasons, in the case of Pakistan, or giving precedence to trading interests over human rights, in the case of China, we have at times failed to take a strong and consistent line against countries whose very structures of government are based on instilling fear in their citizens. They flout democratic principles, abuse human rights and ignore the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Inconsistency and hypocrisy such as this leaves the West in general open to the charge that it is selective in its definition of terrorism and is primarily influenced by the perceived threat to western interests.</p>
<p class="contents">A global fight against terrorism will be successful only if it is free of inconsistency and hypocrisy in its approach and if it tackles the injustices that feed terrorism in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would now like to ask a question: who are the targets of terrorism and what is the logic behind it? It would appear that terrorism targets human beings, and it therefore contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and cannot be based on religious or ideological considerations. If today, the entire world has taken up the fight against terrorism, it has done so because terrorism violates precisely that which the entire world – all the States and all the citizens – has subscribed to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Well then, when we produce definitions of terrorism, we specify, for simplicity’s sake, the groups which carry out terrorist activities. It would be shame, however, if this were to induce us to fall down the slippery slope and lump together with these groups what we define as religious movements, only very small parts of which may be involved in terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have to take a step forward, we must do so not least by sending out a message as the European Union, calling for monitoring of the penal systems of all the States which have signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for, very often, the penal systems which have produced their own internal definitions of human rights are not consistent with the Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I wanted to say in my speech, for I feel that we have to overcome this period of conflicts and be more proactive in working for the good of the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorists have no power if they do not inspire fear. The more outrageous, shocking, unexpected and attention-grabbing an attack is, the greater its success. Yet there are still those who seek to apologise for the terrorists and try to establish some sort of moral equivalency between terrorist acts and, for example, the actions of the security forces of the democracies engaged in counter-terrorism. Terrorism needs to be addressed by a range of policy instruments, only one of which is military force.</p>
<p class="contents">The area where our democracies have traditionally been weakest has been in attacking the legitimacy of the terrorists and fighting them politically in a systematic and well-targeted manner. This aspect is not well understood. We never fought the IRA politically, because we were never clear on our own political objectives. Now we have IRA terrorists in government.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often by our actions we enhance the credibility and status of terrorists and thereby encourage terrorism. The message of recent years is that terrorism works. That is a fatal message.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution contains some elements that are indisputable, but it is very skewed and contains the usual ingredients of anti-Americanism, excessive concern with the rights of terrorists and extremists and those that support them, and further support for the federalist ambitions of the European Union. We have heard a lot of this from other speakers as well. I do not accept the implied condemnation of pre-emptive action in today's dangerous world where weapons of mass destruction may be made available to irrational and fanatical terrorists. Deterrence does not necessarily work. We cannot wait for an attack to take place before we act. This would be a dereliction of duty by any government.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference in paragraph 4 of the resolution to the right of self-defence is incorrect and a distortion of the United Nations Charter. Article 51 of the UN Charter states that 'nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.'</p>
<p class="contents">There are 12 pages in this resolution and it adds very little, either to our knowledge or our capabilities. Where is the call for political solidarity and enhanced cooperation among all the democracies? Where is the demand for improved military capabilities and greater political will by European states and where are the measures to be taken against those that support terrorism? This is what is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recent events, such as those in Bali, the Philippines and Israel, show the urgency of coordinated, joint action to eliminate this social scourge which attacks the most fundamental rights, such as life and democracy, the system of government that we have chosen for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, we reached a swift agreement, and, ten days after the attacks on 11 September 2001, we had already signed a plan to combat terrorism jointly. Mr Vitorino and Mr Patten – who is not present – now is the time to come to this House, to tell us the problems relating to the development of this plan and identify those involved. We do not need a general opinion. We must go into detail and say which States are cooperating more or less than others, because this is a problem that we are also experiencing on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Saturday, the citizens’ group <span class="italic">Basta ya</span>, to which we awarded the Sakharov prize, organised a huge demonstration in San Sebastián for the freedom of Basque and Spanish citizens, so that each individual, whether nationalist or otherwise, might hold whatever political beliefs they wish. Last Tuesday, we interrupted the Plenary to condemn the attack in which a sergeant in the Spanish Civil Guard, Juan Carlos Beiro, died in Leiza (Navarre).</p>
<p class="contents">This is a priority objective, which should encourage all European citizens to call on you to come here to provide explanations, and the Council to identify those States which are fulfilling their duties, implementing the action plan we implemented on 21 September 2001, and those which are not.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not identify who is fulfilling their duties to the greatest and the least extent, we will not be serving our electorate nor defending democracy with democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many have talked about the balance we need to find between the effective combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and consideration for citizens’ rights on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to create an international community founded on the rule of law, in which states bring matters before the courts instead of taking the law into their own hands, what is also required is the resolve to act – if necessary using force – against those powers which, using violence and terror, try to drain the lifeblood of open, democratic and constitutional states. There is of course a need to be able to cooperate in taking such resolute action. I do not believe that preventive action can be excluded if there are clear indications of impending attack or of exposure to terrorism or such like. It may, then, make sense, of course, to prevent such an attack or strike.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the EU’s role and position, I want to say that we are actively involved in this confrontation with international terrorism. We want to see the people responsible brought before the courts so that their crimes can be discovered in the course of a procedure that complies with the principles of the rule of law governing fair trials. In the EU, we are very aware of the fact that the combating of terrorism must not involve infringements of human rights. Just as the end must not justify the means and can never legitimise terrorism, so the end must not justify the means in our fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial resources, the Council has, as a follow-up to Resolution 1373, taken steps to freeze funds belonging to terrorists and terrorist organisations. The first terrorist lists were adopted in December of last year. Since then, the EU’s terrorist list has been revised twice during the Spanish Presidency, and a further revision is anticipated in the very near future during the Danish Presidency. It would be wrong to comment on possible changes until the list is ready, so I shall avoid doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">As quite a few rapporteurs have also mentioned, the relationship between the EU and the United States is basically rock-solid and founded upon a community of values. We are each other’s most important partners, cooperating politically, militarily, economically and culturally, and 11 September has bound us together more closely. We need the United States, and the United States needs us. What binds us together is more important that what divides us.</p>
<p class="contents">At the extraordinary Council meeting on 21 September of last year, we sent a strong signal of solidarity and cooperation to the United States. It is binding upon us, and it has been a success that will now hopefully be crowned by the signing of an agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition. It is the case in this field as in others that, when the EU and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder, there is a lot we can do for justice and freedom in the world. It is crucial that we maintain the close cooperation with the United States, both in this and other areas, and we must of course constantly work to ensure that the United States chooses to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nobody can criticise the measures adopted by the Union or the Member States as being emergency or exceptional rules. They are fully integrated into our common legal framework. Of course, they demonstrate that democracy is not weak when it comes to fighting organised crime or terrorism. A perception by citizens that democracy is not efficient enough in fighting terrorism and organised crime is one possible source of disaffection.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten said, terrorism represents a transnational global threat, requiring transnational global answers. This fact is slowly being accepted by the Member States. We cannot deal with terrorism as if it was business as usual. We need to use police and judicial tools, but they are not enough. We also need to mobilise military and other resources. We need exchanges of intelligence at European level. You know from your own national experience how difficult it can be to ensure proper exchange of intelligence between police forces and secret services in your own Member States. The cooperation between intelligence-gathering services and police forces at European level in the fight against terrorism since 11 September can be successful. However, we need to recognise that there are two other very important areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the fight against the financing of terrorism, which is much more complex. It requires extra efforts. The Commission will give priority to this issue in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, multilateral action. We share Parliament's view that we should give priority to this. The United Nations is the first stage. It is a source of concern that the negotiation of a global convention on terrorism is currently blocked in the United Nations. We must not forget the important role of the Council of Europe in the fight against terrorism. I hope that the negotiations in progress in the Council of Europe on a convention on terrorism will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">In the dialogue with the United States of America on the fight against terrorism and on police and judicial cooperation, we should recognise the important contribution the American debate on civil liberties can make to our own European debate on fundamental rights and civil liberties. We should not minimise the ongoing debate in the United States on those key issues or leave them isolated. That is why we are engaged in a dialogue with the United States on a mutual legal assistance agreement and an extradition agreement in which we defend our own points of view and our values. We will also test the political will of the United States to accept and respect our positions.</p>
<p class="contents">The test case for Mr Pomés Ruiz in the implementation of the decisions taken at European level will come fairly shortly. As you know, the framework decision on terrorism will have to be transposed into the national laws of the Member States by the end of this year and the European arrest warrant by the beginning of 2004. However, seven Member States have, as you know, committed themselves to adopting the European arrest warrant in their legal systems in the first half of 2003. The Commission can only encourage them to stick to those commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Inter-state cooperation must therefore be carried out more actively, so that Islamic extremists can have no sanctuary. It seems that the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was only an initial stage in this battle, which must be conducted first and foremost within our own States. In this respect, Commissioner Patten, who is so generous in doling out advice to non-European countries, should first ask himself about the welcome that terrorist organisations in the British system are given.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from advocating increased vigilance and enhanced cooperation amongst our Member States, the motion for a joint resolution sets off in a dangerous direction by recommending greater use of the quartet method, which could eventually lead to the Security Council being bypassed. And the same resolution becomes laughable when it attempts to persuade us that one of the main challenges in combating terrorism could be the three-pillar structure of the Treaty on European Union! Any subject, even terrorism, can be exploited in order to advance the federalist cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
