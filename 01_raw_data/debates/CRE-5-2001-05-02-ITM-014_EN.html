<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jillian (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, the purpose of this regulation is to ensure consistency by 2002 in the rules governing the non-commercial movement of pet animals, which has been commonly labelled the pet-passport scheme. The fact that this proposal has been brought forward by the Commission represents a remarkable achievement in action taken to control rabies. The success of the vaccination campaigns against rabies have led to a fall in the number of cases amongst cats and dogs from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998 and it is because of that success that we have seem the partial abolition of the six-month quarantine system in the United Kingdom and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the problem of rabies, which has prevented consistent rules being adopted up until now, and so Member States have dealt with the movement of pet animals in very different ways, so I am sure that a uniform set of rules will be very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission measures are based largely on the British scheme and they allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU and certain third countries on condition that they can be identified by electronic chip or tattoo, that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel. The proposal also allows the free movement of insects, fish and some other animals. It is very important that there is scope within this proposal for certain Member States to vary the provisions when special circumstances make that necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed both Article 37 and 152(4)(b) as a double legal base. However, as the regulation refers only to pet animals and to the adoption of veterinary measures to protect health, the Environment Committee agreed that the regulation should be based only on Article 152(4)(b) which relates to public health and which covers rabies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this view as again the proposal concerns only the movement of pet animals and its aim is the protection of public health. I hope that we can reach agreement on the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">The key points of debate in committee were first the use of tattoos and electronic identification systems. Tattoos can cause problems, they can become difficult to read or they can be altered. In contrast, the use of electronic chips are more effective both in terms of identification, but they are also a much more humane method because the animal does not need a pain reliever or a tranquilliser. Therefore, in the long-term we believe that microchips are preferable, but we have to take account of the fact that a number of Member States at the moment accept tattoos under their national legislation and so a transitional period of 8 years is proposed by the Committee for the phasing out of the tattoos. Similarly, it is proposed that during this transition period the countries which do not accept tattoos as a valid form of identification at the moment can still require electronic microchips only.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 8 refers to the need to state clearly in this proposal that puppies and kittens cannot moved until they have reached the age for vaccination and other requirements because there is misconception about this. If this scheme is to be successful, it is crucial that it is operated effectively. The use of specified ISO transponders would help achieve this. Similarly, the capacity to record the name and address of the animal owner would assist in combating trafficking in pet animals, and clarification of the anti-rabies vaccine is included in the report as well as the OIE International Animal Health Code again for the purposes of effectiveness of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that we discussed in committee is that of quarantine and the purpose of Amendment No 9 is to clarify that animals from third countries at risk of rabies which are brought into Sweden, Ireland or the UK, the so-called sensitive countries, via another Member State have to remain in that country for at least six months before travelling to those three countries. This of course removes the need for quarantine, but it also provides the extra safeguards that those countries require.</p>
<p class="contents">A controversial issue has been that of ferrets and whether or not they should be included in this regulation. The Commission proposal includes ferrets in the category of pets which would not require any specific animal health requirements. There have been very different views on this, but the view of the Environment Committee is that this would pose an unacceptable risk and ferrets should therefore be removed from Annex I, Part b.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is very important that detailed information is available for consumers and for staff at EU borders to ensure they are familiar with the requirements. My aim in drafting the report has been to retain the positive and essential elements of the Commission's proposal whilst at the same time taking account of the requirements of certain Member States. We heard a lot in the previous debate about confidence, and confidence in this scheme is essential for its successful operation and the amendments are designed to improve the Commission's texts to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The matter may at first sight appear trivial, but we Swedes remember the Swedish ambassador to Portugal, who has now been retired for a good 20 years, who refused to leave his residence in Lisbon because his life companion, an old Angora cat, would be forced to remain in quarantine for a long period in order to be able to enter Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, these rules are intended to offer protection against rabies, a disease which, in popular belief, has fearful and deeply mystical associations. It is not for nothing that, in Swedish, the disease is known by a word also meaning hydro<span class="italic">phobia</span>. Ireland, Great Britain and Sweden have been free from rabies for quite a few years, and the proposal for a Regulation is therefore, in the first place, of significance for these countries, even though the incidence of rabies has declined throughout Europe. We must, however, make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of rabies to, in the first place, areas that are free of the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake of mad cow disease and foot-and-mouth disease, cases of rabies in, for example, Great Britain as a result of changed EU regulations would give rise to deep mistrust of the EU as an organisation. In the course of dealing with this matter, the legal basis has been changed. The change is explained in terms of the fact that the Regulation is aimed at protecting public health. Nonetheless, animal diseases too, including those affecting pets, can be very aggressive and cause great suffering. Examples include aggressive forms of distemper.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Byrne: do you believe that protective measures in accordance with other EU directives are enough to enable the Member States to take measures to combat infectious diseases that can cause great suffering among domestic animals?</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, it has been incomprehensible that the rules governing the commercial transport of animals have been less rigorous than for domestic animals of the same species. The undersigned therefore submitted a proposal to the committee to the effect that the Commission should review existing legislation governing trade involving animals with a view to attempting to achieve harmonisation with the rules in this proposal for a Regulation. This was also the committee’s decision, but I would alert the Bureau and the secretariat to the fact that the wording in the present proposal has been changed on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Many are of the belief that puppies and kittens cannot be infected by rabies and can therefore cross the borders in Europe freely. It is therefore important that the proposal for a Regulation should have been clarified in this respect, especially with a view to reducing the illicit trade in puppies and kittens not protected against rabies that clearly exists at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from dogs and cats, ferrets are the only pets that can spread rabies. There are now scientific proofs that vaccinating ferrets against rabies is effective. According to the Swedish state Institute of Veterinary Medicine, ferrets ought in future to be vaccinated in the same way as dogs and cats. In the reading in committee, all mention of ferrets was, however, removed from the list of measures to be taken. Reference to ferrets ought, however, to be introduced into Annex 1, Part A, alongside reference to dogs and cats, and, if this is not approved, ferrets should continue to be referred to in Part B as per the Commission’s proposal. Completely to omit ferrets is irresponsible. We must remember that it is, in particular, children and young people who have ferrets as pets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, for the sound work she has done on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Evans, not only on the work she has put in on this, but her very fair and lucid summation of the proposal as it left committee. What we have here is that critical balance between public health requirements and common humanity. Humanity forces us to consider the suffering of those who have to leave cherished pets behind when they travel throughout the European Union. We call this the "Whisky and Soda" reform in Britain, not because it was conceived in some drunken evening in SANCO but because those are the names of Commissioner Patten's two dogs which for many years he had to leave behind in France when came back to England and he was the principal sufferer – certainly in terms of publicity – who has brought about perhaps a change of thinking in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to mention three critical areas: first, the time scale; Mrs Evans has accepted now that we have a time scale for the changeover of 8 years, which seems to me to be effective given the life span of most pets in moving from tattoos with all their weaknesses to a proper system of microchips. I do not personally think that in Amendment No 7 where there is a proposal that we have to have an absolutely universal system of ISO standard microchips, that you can expect all animals fitted with a chip to be of that universal variety in the early stages. We have to be a little more lenient there. Secondly, I am delighted that we have now effective proposals, which I am sure the Commissioner will accept for the quarantining of animals which come from third countries where rabies is endemic – the Indian subcontinent would be a case in point. People do move about, their animals move about and we know from other considerations, which are now taking part in another debate on vaccination which is going on with the import and export of foodstuffs, how many things come into and out of the European Community, which are putting us at hazard. We do not want that in this case and so it is very important that the quarantine provisions remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ferrets. The Ferret Trust have been following me around over the last few days in a state of great excitement about the provisions on ferrets. In the UK, for sure, there are still some doubt whether you can actually prove the vaccination of a ferret sufficiently to be certain that it could be vaccinated and then be safely transferred as a pet from one country to another. The Ferret Trust told me, very temperately, that they thought the determination of whether ferrets should be included in the pet passport scheme should be deferred until further research had been carried out and they quote two US authorities, Dr Bruce Williams and Dr Zack Miller, as experts in that field. I would happy to go along with that. I have nothing against ferrets, but I would think that even a small risk that rabies may be spread by even such an exotic source as this needs us to give further pause for thought and consideration, rather than simply rushing ahead with a proposal about which at least one Member State still has serious reservations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a disease which has filled people with fear and horror for many years and it is a delight to see the reality of the decline in statistics which shows that the disease is now being eradicated. I am also pleased, as Mr Whitehead has indicated, that the suffering and grief felt both by pets and by pet owners when animals have had to be put into quarantine for lengthy periods of time is now being replaced by passports and tattoos, so this is good news.</p>
<p class="contents">On a technical point, I look forward to hearing the Commission's response on the amendments which have been moved about the legal basis for this directive. I am also delighted that the basis for the European proposals are those which have already been applied in Britain. As Mr Whitehead has said, I have learnt, like he, a great deal more about ferrets than I knew a month ago. I am sure the Commission has too. I am sure in fact that the Commissioner is a great ferret fancier: if he has not got a house already full of ferrets then I am sure that the many newspaper articles about the virtues of ferrets have encouraged him to fill his house with ferrets I have no doubt they will make charming and affectionate pets and I look forward to them taking their place alongside cats and dogs at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision we made in committee, just a couple weeks ago, about whether ferrets should be included on the list and have passports or not, was one of the most difficult that I have ever made. The reality is that ferrets seem to have caused no particular problems. One French ferret apparently seems to have been the cause of all the concern about whether ferrets can cause rabies. I am sorry about this, but I look forward to a situation where the blood test for rabies antibodies can be verified and approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee and the scope of the regulation can be extended to encompass ferrets at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we have to accept that if we are to put the fight against rabies as our first priority, then ferrets should not be included on the list at the present time. But I look forward to ferrets having the right to roam across Europe, but not just yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not particularly exercised about ferrets one way or the other I have to confess, but I rather like the line Mr Whitehead took: we should look again and maybe ask some of the experts. There are many of us who are not very up-to-date in terms of what can or cannot be done on ferrets in relation to immunity testing. I would not like the job myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I must confess a conflict of interest at the start. When I return from Brussels or wherever, be it a Thursday evening or Friday morning, the greatest welcome I get is from my collection of dogs – at least in terms of the noise they make and the length of time. Yes, the rest of the family are delighted – a quick "Hi Mum", – a head goes up and you might get a hug and then back to the TV or whatever they were doing – but 20 minutes later the dogs are still running round in high excitement. So I can really empathise with those who feel passionately about the need to be able to bring animals freely throughout Europe subject to the conditions being laid down today and I welcome the report here before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission measures proposed to allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU, and a selection of other animals that are classified as pets as well. However, the Environment Committee did give the ferrets a knock and that is where it stands subject to perhaps investigating what my colleague Mr Whitehead has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome very much, as others have said, that we can celebrate the success of the anti-rabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the UK, Ireland and Sweden to change their quarantine system, thereby giving us the template that the Commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the EU. We must be on guard though about bringing pet animals in from third countries, because any cases of rabies which are found in the EU at the moment come from third countries where rabies is still endemic. Let us be very careful about border controls in relation to importing again this horrible disease particularly to countries that are now rabies-free.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the measures proposed by the Commission, animals will have to be identified by electronic transponder or tattoo, and provide evidence that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel. I have problems with any continuation of the use of tattoos, and the Environment Committee is of the same view. I also have problems with ad lib use of transponders rather than standardisation of the transponder and this view is also supported by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, the FVE. They feel very strongly that only a standard microchip should be used. Remember it is 8 years down the line. We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us is based on a Scientific Veterinary Committee report written in September 1977. This was before the agreed ISO standards 11784 and 11785 came into being, and therefore, before there was true compatibility between products from different manufacturers. Since the introduction of standards which can be specified in legislation, as done in the UK pet statute, all ISO standard readers can read all ISO standard microchips. Initially, we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed. It has never been demonstrated that this can be achieved and technical advice from engineers involved in microchip design and manufacture indicates that it will never be easy or even possible to achieve. We must bear in mind that more modern advanced microchips are being designed with authentication programmes which will be even harder to change fraudulently. However, the value of the benefit in changing a microchip identification number in a pet animal is unlikely to ever be so great as to warrant the effort and the cost involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Tattoos, however, are much less satisfactory. They are difficult to read in small species such as the cat, they are difficult to read in breeds where the ears are cropped, they are difficult for regulatory officers to read in aggressive or apprehensive individuals and they are relatively easy to erase and to change fraudulently. I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7, even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt, but I go for a standardisation of the chip, and only the chip not the tattoo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This assembly is well aware of the importance of this issue which concerns all European citizens who are travelling either for holidays or for longer stays with their pets and do not want to leave them behind. I do not mean that citizens cannot today travel with their pets, but the different regulations applicable in the Member States to movements inside the Community, as well as movements from third countries, are definitely difficult to understand and somewhat discouraging. It is therefore time to establish a common set of rules applicable to the entire European Community, because this issue is directly linked to the free movement of European citizens when they own a pet.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre of gravity of this proposal is of course the rabies risk linked to movements of cats and dogs, the two major domestic carnivore species involved in the transmission of this fatal disease. On this essential issue, the proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Zoo Sanitary Code, on reports of the Scientific Veterinary Committee and on the conclusions on panels of international experts consulted on the assessment of the rabies risk linked to movements of domestic carnivores.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most satisfied that the report supports the Commission's general approach on this fundamental question of public health. There is unanimous agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report. I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 12 and 13 relating to the legal base of the proposal. The report concludes that Article 152(4)(b) of the Treaty is sufficient because the essential aim of the proposal is to protect public health. This is indeed true at this stage, nevertheless the Commission considers that measures relating strictly to animal disease with no impact on public health could be necessary in the future, and a double legal base with Article 37 is therefore necessary. I was asked by one Member earlier if we have we enough legal base or enough information to prevent other diseases in animals. This is one of the reasons why Article 37 is included as a legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware from other proposals brought before Parliament that there is a general reluctance in Parliament and in the Environment Committee to support Article 37 as a legal base for provisions in conjunction with Article 152, probably because Article 37 is not a co-decision article. But I would ask Parliament to reconsider its view in relation to this particular amendment and consider the question in the light of the need for animal health considerations being relevant, as one Member mentioned. Hence the need for Article 37 rather than Article 152.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7 because it goes far beyond the scope of the proposal which is movement between Member States and from third countries. This amendment provides an obligation for all Member States in relation to the generalisation of electronic identification of all cats and dogs and the establishment of a database to trace any stray or lost animal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the classification of third countries, the Commission proposal adopts the same conditions for imports from certain third countries whose rabies status is equivalent to that of the Member States as those which apply for internal movements. Amendment No 10 suggests imposing on this category of third countries the criteria provided in the International Zoo Sanitary code for the recognition of a rabies-free country. This is not consistent with the conditions applicable to internal movements. A number of Member States are not rabies-free countries under this definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory. This would be a discrimination which is not scientifically sound, and therefore Amendment No 10 is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 14. This amendment would delete "ferret" from the list of species which may be moved inside the Community with no veterinary conditions. The Commission proposal was based on a risk analysis which concluded that this species has no significance in the epidemiology of rabies in Europe. I understand the special concerns with regard to this species because it is a carnivore and does bite, but the simple deletion from the list in Annex I, Part b is unfair to this species, as the only reason is that it belongs to the carnivore genus.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say to Mr Davies that I have discovered quite a lot more about ferrets than I knew yesterday and some of my meetings during the day today, including some of the exotic entertainments engaged some Member States, might account for some of interest that Mr Davies supports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have been more open to the creation of a new category for ferrets with the requirement for vaccination, which is possible, but no post vaccination test can be foreseen. The amendments submitted by the rapporteur and committee, but rejected, were heading in that direction and would have reached, in my opinion, a solution acceptable to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept six amendments: Amendment No 4 concerning the commitment for the future on a revision of the regulations applying to commercial trade species; Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 15 which bring clarification to the proposal and Amendment No 11 relating to a communication on this issue to the public by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with great interest that I discovered in Amendment No 6 a real pro-active position in favour of a generalisation, in the short term, of the electronic identification complying with ISO standard of animals moved between Member States or from third countries. Therefore I can accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 14. On the other hand, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 8, 9, 11, 15 and 6.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to once again thank Mrs Evans for her excellent report and her support to this important proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
