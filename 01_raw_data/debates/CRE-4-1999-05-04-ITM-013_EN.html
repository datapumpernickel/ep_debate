On 17 December 1998 Parliament adopted 14 amendments to the common position of the Council. During the conciliation procedure, 12 amendments were adopted verbatim or in a form close to the original, which I regard as a positive result. In line with the compromise achieved, the deadline for transposition of the directive into national law is now to be 1 January 2002 at the latest, rather than in three year's time. It was particularly important for Parliament's delegation that this amendment was accepted, as it will be at that point that the majority of the EU public will handling the euro as cash for the first time, and it is likely that price transparency will lead to more cross‐border purchases within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Minimum harmonisation of the law on guarantees will save the consumer unnecessary aggravation. It was also accepted that a product produced or manufactured in accordance with a purchaser's requirements, and for which the purchaser supplied the necessary materials, comes under the directive. An exception to this is when any lack of conformity that arises is due to the materials supplied. If a consumer instals a product himself and a lack of conformity arises as a result of incorrect installation instructions intended for the consumer, this is also covered by the law on guarantees. The guarantee directive will be included in the list of actions for restraint to protect the interest of the consumers, and in order to make purchases within the internal market simpler for the consumer, a recommendation will be made to manufacturers whose goods are sold in several Member States that they should provide consumers with a list including at least one contact address in each country where the goods are marketed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only a recommendation, as to my regret Parliament did not want to go any further, but perhaps many manufacturers of consumer durables will in time see this as an opportunity giving them better prospects for marketing their products throughout the internal market. In order to avoid difficulties of interpretation to the detriment of consumers, it was once again made clear in the result of the conciliation that if a product is restored free of charge to the contractually stipulated condition, any costs incurred, such as delivery, labour and materials costs, will be borne by the seller.</p>
<p class="contents">That gives you a brief overview of the most important results of the Conciliation Committee. If you vote in favour of this conciliation result, and I presume that you will, consumers in many Member States will be given better legal guarantees for consumer goods, and you can rely on it that this guarantee will ensure a minimum level of protection in each Member State. It applies to all consumer goods whether new or second‐hand; the legal guarantee is valid for two years, but for second‐hand goods, it is up to Member States to decide whether purchasers and sellers can agree on a guarantee period of one year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, it should at least be made clear to the public that a product is only considered to be non‐conforming if the lack of conformity was present at the time of purchase. The burden of proof is reversed within the first six months after purchase, which means that it is assumed that a lack of conformity was already present on delivery, unless the seller can prove damage by the consumer or unless the type of product or lack of conformity rules out such an assumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has supplemented the term ‘lack of conformity' in a helpful way. A defective product is defined as being non‐conforming, and published statements by the manufacturers or distributors in advertising or on the label are included in this definition. We welcome this definition, because it is often advertising that leads purchasers to buy. The first remedy in the case of non‐conforming goods is the right to repair without charge or a replacement product, as far as this is economically viable and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">If a repair or a replacement product are out of the question as a remedy, the purchaser still has the option of an appropriate price reduction or the termination of the contract. By virtue of this hierarchy of remedy options, Parliament has struck a reasonable balance between the interests of consumers and sellers. The directive provides for clear conditions, which is also important for commercial guarantees, that is to say guarantees voluntarily provided by manufacturers or sellers. In order to ensure that consumers are not misled, guarantees must contain precise and transparent information, including a statement that a given guarantee does not affect the statutory rights of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I believe that the directive has at least one weak point. The common position allows Member States to introduce a two‐month time limit for lodging a complaint, in other words the consumer must report the lack of conformity within two months of discovery. Even if only one Member State were to introduce this time limit, this would run counter to the philosophy of the directive, which is to achieve minimum harmonisation. Unfortunately, at second reading Parliament could not achieve the majority needed to delete this provision. Nevertheless, as we stand at the end of the end of this Parliament's legislative term, we have once again succeeded in giving Europe's citizens more rights as consumers, and I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament, the Commission and the Council for achieving this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, it may be appropriate in my few minutes to pay tribute to the rapporteur and with her to the Commissioner who is also with us in this last but one consumer debate of this Parliament, and, indeed, to the processes of co‐decision, which we have implemented and which have perhaps meant more in this field than almost any other. This has been a significant success for Parliament and also for both the Commission and the Member States in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish I could say that these procedures always go so swiftly but in this case we have a model where many of the reservations that were stated at the outset, many of the fears of commercial interests, many of the fears of parliamentarians, were set at rest by the way in which these procedures went. As a result we now have a situation in which there is adequate protection for the consumer both when dealing with the issue of goods that may turn out to be faulty even if those are in part manufactured by the consumers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We have successfully addressed the issue of second‐hand goods which many feared could not effectively come into this directive. We have shown that ‘where there's a will, there's a way". You can show that although second‐hand goods are, by definition, different from those that are purchased new, a different period of reflection and remedy suffices. The whole mechanism of the hierarchy of remedies can and will work effectively and beautifully here.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am very pleased with this. I should like to thank Commissioner Bonino for all here help, not just in this but in many other ways in this five years. My last words should be to Mrs Kuhn. This is her last report in her last Parliament. In my opinion she has been a model comrade and a model colleague, diligent, direct, dedicated. I wish we had more like here and I wish those outside knew the work that really goes on in the interstices of this Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fitzsimons </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, like Mr Whitehead, I am pleased to arise in support of Mrs Kuhn. This is a very good consumers' report. It is as well to remember that in June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive of guarantees for consumer goods and after‐sales services. The intention of the proposal was to create minimum harmonisation of a statutory provision within individual Member States concerning the need for legal guarantees, all of which Mr Whitehead so eloquently referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple aim of the proposal is to ensure that wherever consumers shop in the European Union, they will enjoy minium levels of guarantees and will be able to seek redress in their home countries. The directive ensures that Member States must transpose international law by January 2002 and this will create a common set of minimum rules entitling the consumer to redress. These are free repairs, replacement, price reduction or the cancellation of the contract in the event of defective purchases. At the insistence of this Parliament, free repairs or replacements will also include postage, labour and materials. This is excellent work done by this Parliament. We have also ensured that compensation for the incorrect installation of goods, for example wardrobes will also apply for the protection of consumers who have been misled by faulty instructions.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be recommended to the producers of consumer goods to attach to their product a list giving at least one contact address in every Member State where the product is marketed. The idea is that cross‐border shoppers can contact this address if they have problems. Member States will be able to create mediation bodies to handle consumer complaints irrespective of whether they are national or cross‐border.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a strong recommendation to provide consumers with manufacturers' contact addresses where goods are sold in several Member States. This is important because so many people travel not only across Europe but across the world. So, as a member of the Consumer Protection Committee, I have at all times, along with Mrs Kuhn and Mr Whitehead, supported measures that will ensure that the needs and concerns of consumers are given real and appropriate protection by means of European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the four‐year consumer protection programme for 1999‐2003 is worth over £91m and if requests are made for further increases in this budget, I am confident that Parliament would support such recommendations in the future. I would like to be associated with Mr Whitehead's remarks in relation to Mrs Kuhn. I compliment her on her dedication and commitment in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection down the years and I wish her every joy and good health in the future.</p>

If we look at the timing I am particularly pleased that I am speaking on the final point of this directive at the last part‐session of our Parliament – which for me is also the last session, at least on consumer matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission introduced this piece of legislation in June 1996. It was transmitted to Parliament in August 1996. In the meantime some points have changed. However, at the end of the day we managed to come forward with a good piece of legislation which will produce better protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as I said, I will not repeat the points of the legislation but I will congratulate in particular the work of Mrs Kuhn and all other colleagues in Parliament. For once I will also praise the work of the Commission service. When I introduced this directive I told them it would never be approved. In fact, in the three years we have been able to work together in such a way that finally this directive is approved. This is a good legacy for the next Parliament and the next Commission.</p>
