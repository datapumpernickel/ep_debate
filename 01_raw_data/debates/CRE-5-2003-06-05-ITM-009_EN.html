Yet there has been effectively no response from the Council. At the moment when the whole question of democratic accountability in the EU is under discussion, it is time the Council took more notice of European Parliament resolutions. The Council did renew, but in a weakened form, the sanctions against the regime. The travel ban against Mugabe and senior members of his regime has not been effectively enforced. Indeed, only last month the Trade and Industry Minister attended an EU meeting in the EU capital, Brussels, organised by the ACP, an institution created by the EU. We cannot even manage to enforce a travel ban in respect of our own institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In November last year it was left to the European Parliament to enforce the sanctions by denying the Zimbabwean representatives access to the European Parliament. That, of course, led to the postponement of that meeting, but we have to face this down. If African countries are willing to wreck the ACP for the sake of defending Mugabe, let them do it, but let us stop making exceptions all the time with respect to this travel ban.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is very much more serious at the moment. There are daily troubles in Zimbabwe, food and fuel are increasingly in short supply, inflation is running at 50% a month, and consumer prices will rise by 300% at least in the next few months. Zimbabweans are starving, 12.6 million are in need of food aid, and the strikes and demonstrations which have been taking place are evidence of the failure of the international community to act effectively against Mugabe. This resolution calls for us to renew our efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cries of distress from individual victims are still reaching us today from this humanitarian disaster. What are we to think, for example, of a secretary of the MDC, the opposition party, who was attacked in her house one night by one of Mugabe’s teams of gangsters? The accusation: being a prostitute of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. The punishment: having the barrel of a gun inserted into her vagina, with death threats and other demands I do not wish to mention here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this horrifying context that Tsvangirai called on the stricken population to stage a week of peaceful protest. The dictator, who will stop at nothing, attempted to suppress this cry for help with the now routine arrest of the opposition leader. Like the present resolution, I also find it incomprehensible and extremely unbelievable that the Council, circumventing the prohibition on travel which it imposed itself, is in consultation with this criminal regime in Brussels. This is an affront to the Zimbabwean people in need, as is the willingness of other African regimes to maintain contact with the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">With the greatest possible emphasis I call on the Commission and the Council to reject this regime without compromise. In accordance with paragraph 5, I would also ask the Council to set an example to the international community and actually follow a general strategy of restoring democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself was able to experience the escalation in violence when I visited the country on the occasion of the parliamentary elections as an election observer, albeit under the wrong label, because I was not recognised as representing the European Union. Over thirty opposition politicians lost their lives in these disputes, and we are now seeing a renewed escalation in violence. We must now face the fact that not only is Mr Mugabe using live weapons against peaceful demonstrators, but he is also using hunger as a weapon against his people. It has already been mentioned here today that over half of the population is dependent on food aid. We too, therefore, find ourselves in a quandary: if we do not want to let the people starve, we have to help them, but in so doing we are also unintentionally helping to keep Mugabe in power.</p>
<p class="contents">Prices for essential goods are soaring in Zimbabwe. The rate of inflation is exploding, and is currently the highest in the world. The economy is in ruins; exports and tourism, once flourishing sources of income, have collapsed. The rule of law, once so dependable, has been set aside, and the most recent outrages have shown that the Council was right to agree to the sanctions against the Mugabe regime. However, those sanctions are not being consistently applied. This must be demanded as a matter of urgency! If we expect these measures to make any impression on the regime, then they must also be consistently applied. We had this problem with an ACP meeting, which broke up as a result. We shall continue to come up against this problem, and if the Commission grants a travel permit for ACP talks or other meetings, then the regime will be strengthened still further, and our position, namely that we are in favour of the restoration of the rule of law and democracy and in favour of the protection of human rights, will be weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">This in turn weakens our position within the ACP meetings too, where we are, after all, trying to get our African partner countries on our side, and that is certainly no easy task. We have experienced many disappointments. We have even experienced the situation in which we have not received support for our position in favour of the rule of law, for the protection of human rights and finally for a life fit for human beings in that country, complete with full democratic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise, however, that, in a secret ballot, a good quarter of those present at the ACP meeting agreed with us, and some delegates even dared to say so openly, and to condemn, very forcefully, what is happening in Zimbabwe. However, we must remind all those who sit around the table with Mugabe in Africa that to support such a regime cannot be to follow the path of legality. We need to make our position absolutely clear here, and so, too, must the Commission.</p>

We have done this often here, with precious little result. There has been no other country about which we have accepted so many resolutions with so little effect. Let us keep things in perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is not the country with the largest number of victims of war or violence in Africa, but that does not detract from the fact that the situation is deteriorating dramatically. The economic situation in the country has never been so bad and is worsening every day. 7.2 million of the 12.4 million people are starving, there are violations of human rights, and so on. Torture is the order of the day, and the arrest of journalists is making a mockery of freedom of the press.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Zimbabwe, however, have the will to bring about a peaceful transition. The MDC is exerting pressure through strikes and political actions, and we must support this pressure. We must support Mr Tsvangirai, who was the moral victor in the elections. If the elections had not been falsified, he would now most likely be the head of state. The opposition is exerting this pressure, but – and we noticed this during the ACP conferences – more and more African countries are willing to exert pressure. This has not always produced results, but it was important that Mr Mbeki of South Africa and the president of Nigeria both exerted pressure on 5 May, even if this does not seem to be producing immediate results.</p>
<p class="contents">But who are we to think that everything can change in an instant. How does Europe handle this pressure? Parliament is continually asking for all dialogue to be brought to an end. Is that the right method? The Council is obviously pursuing a different method and wants to impose sanctions as long as these do not stand in the way of normal dialogue within the international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must know what we want once and for all. I call on Parliament to exercise pressure and to continue to do so and not to continually remain divided as to the way in which we do this. I support any healthy measure that will place the Mugabe government against the wall, but I also understand that the people of Zimbabwe, who have already suffered so much for the sake of democracy, also want to avoid a bloody war. We must know what we want, the Council must know what it wants and must not add a sentence about Zimbabwe in some back room somewhere, like in the G8. This will not help us at all. We share the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe, but we are also dreaming that democracy will ultimately prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, you have given the people of Zimbabwe oppression, terror, ill-treatment, torture and killing.</p>
<p class="contents">Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe a new future and a new equality, including equality of rights. It was emphatically not to create an inverted racism or to degrade and oppress people because of the colour of their skin, their political views or their party allegiances.</p>
<p class="contents">Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe food and a future. It was not to give them hunger, famine, despair and death. Your task was, moreover, to become a part of Zimbabwe’s history, of its bright and positive history. It was not to enter the history books as a notorious, cruel, narrow-minded and malicious dictator.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mugabe, I have had the privilege of meeting many worthy campaigners for human rights and democracy in your splendid country, Zimbabwe. The violence committed against them by your troops and soldiers will not prevail. In a year’s time, you will no longer be the leader of Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have passed so many resolutions that we refer to them only <span class="italic">en bloc</span>, and hardly even bother to count them anymore. I could really just play back a recording of my last speech, because fundamentally nothing has changed there, unfortunately. If anything things have just become worse for the people in Zimbabwe. Even those who have written for our esteemed Commissioner the words that she is just about to say to us could probably, in the main, have substituted what they wrote last time, because the situation has not changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The real political problem facing the EU is not so much what it does as what it does not do. I would like to say to the Council, which as usual is not present, that one can do wrong even by doing nothing. Must it come to a situation like the one in the Congo? What Mrs Maes said was right: there are worse situations in Africa than the one in Zimbabwe. Do conditions have to become like those in the Congo? How many deaths will it take before the Council at least stops making the Zimbabwe Minister for Industry and Trade welcome in the EU, or even takes effective action against Mugabe? We are sending an intervention force to the Congo. Obviously the requisite number of people must have been killed there. In the case of Zimbabwe, however, we did not even refuse entry to a minister. I am very much in favour of our attempting, jointly, under French leadership, to restore peace in the Congo, but I would also like to say clearly that we cannot accept it when France, on the subject of Zimbabwe, has for years prevented or delayed effective measures or has actively blocked them. The Council must obviously face up to its responsibilities here and, if necessary, we must invite the relevant individual governments to come and explain themselves to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>

As far as the Commission is concerned, it is aware of the fact that conditions in Zimbabwe are very unstable, to use diplomatic language. We are monitoring this week’s events very closely. We know that the climate is deteriorating, that political violence is on the increase, that there are more and more human rights violations and breaches of the rule of law, and that the human suffering is getting worse. We strongly condemn the repressive measures taken recently with regard to the opposition, in particular the arrest on Monday of the leader of the opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai, and other members of the MDC, the Movement for Democratic Change. These measures are part of the government’s efforts to crack down on the strikes the MDC has called for this week. Given the gravity of the situation, the Commission fully supported the publication on 3 June by the Council presidency of a declaration by the Union on Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are equally concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and are therefore playing an active role in the measures to respond to the most urgent cases. Over the past year, we have contributed almost EUR 93 million in the form of emergency food and humanitarian aid in order to relieve the suffering of the Zimbabwean people and to ensure that they were not penalised. We are going to continue with these projects to provide direct assistance to the country, particularly in the social sector and as regards respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As it normally does, the Commission is continuing to explore all avenues of dialogue in the hope of improving the situation. We support all of the pressure from the international community, the African heads of state and the SADC that may be exerted on the Zimbabwean Government to encourage it to respect human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. We must once again, and relentlessly, emphasise that these concepts are essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement that links the European Union and Zimbabwe. In this context, the Commission welcomed the recent initiative by three African presidents to encourage the resumption of dialogue between the parties. It fully shares the concern expressed at the Evian G8 meeting regarding the terrible situation in this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
