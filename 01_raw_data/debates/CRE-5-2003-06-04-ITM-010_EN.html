<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraisse (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I am happy to be able to present my report to you this evening, although, as you can testify, the House is now looking a little empty. The issue of women and sport pertains to both my Parliamentary responsibilities. It relates to both the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. It is an own-initiative report, which in essence deals with a fundamental element of our democracy. Sport has formed part of the basis of the development of democracy since ancient times.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also happy that this report has been completed under the Greek Presidency. I would like to give you a brief outline of the different contextual elements of this own-initiative report, as I set out to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to acknowledge that there is a huge disparity between the situation of men and women and between boys and girls on the issue of sport and access to sport, whether pursued at a high level or as a leisure activity. It is essential to recognise this disparity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, sport is and remains a means of self-fulfilment at all stages of life. The issue of equality of opportunity comes into play here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as there is the disparity I mentioned, we need to take account of an issue that poses some difficulties. If we want to ensure equality between young girls and young boys, between men and women and amongst teenagers and young adults, we need to take account of the disparities and differences between men and women when it comes to sporting performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have told me that they think this has been taken on board already. I note that both the army and the police have had to arrange for different competitive and performance-related tests for men and women. This is an attempt to establish equality between different body types to ensure men and women have equal opportunities. I have tried to explain this idea in recital M of my report in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to achieve a situation of equality or equilibrium, however you want to put it, when we have two different starting points. In my opinion, these are the three contextual elements which form the basis of the report. I would remind you that a report on women and sport was presented to Parliament thirteen years ago. I had hoped to be a pioneer, but I am not. I must recognise that others have highlighted this problem before me, and I am delighted about this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main contexts in which equality of opportunity and self-fulfilment are an issue, namely sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and top-level sport. It is perhaps in this regard that I set out to be innovative in relation to the previous report. All three areas must be taken into account in the development of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">School is a place for setting standards and for teaching girls and boys together. It is a place for opening horizons rather than slamming the door on future opportunities. All the professionals have told me that school plays a key role in women’s access to sport. Sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for some people, for some women I should say. You need to have the time, the means and the opportunity to access sport in order to pursue it as a leisure activity. There are far fewer sports facilities for young girls, teenagers, young women and women than there are for young boys and men. There is a great disparity in that pursuing a sport as a leisure activity is a luxury for women who have to deal with the demands of both work and a family. I wanted to stress this point.</p>
<p class="contents">As for top-level sport, we first need to understand the issues involved. It is sometimes difficult to get up-to-date with what is happening in women’s sport at the highest level. The media do not always cover the issues as they could or as they should or as we would wish them to. Furthermore, we must not overlook the specific health problems encountered by some top sportswomen. There are disorders and hormone problems which can later lead to reproductive problems or premature ageing. All the professionals have stressed these health problems to me. As one sociologist put it, sport does not equate to health, contrary to the received wisdom. Lastly, everyone is agreed on the need to ensure that women have a greater role in decision-making. This is also a key element.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to explain that I have recently undertaken a good deal of work with the different political groups. I would like to thank them for being so willing to contribute. I would also like to thank the Greek Presidency for organising a meeting on women and sport, held in Thessaloniki on 8 March, which I attended. Thanks are also due to the Presidency for including my proposal to create a ‘Women and Sport’ unit in its declaration at the end of this meeting. Further, I would like to thank the International Olympic Committee and the European Women and Sport network, which have been very cooperative.</p>
<p class="contents">The last idea that I would like to put forward stems from what I heard from all the parties involved, professionals included. They asked me to stand up for mixed participation in sport. This is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is entitled ‘Women and Sport’ but its objective is mixed participation. We want men and women, girls and boys to be involved in what is and should remain a pleasurable activity for both genders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the report is concerned, I should like to start with the analysis relating to the Community value of sport. I believe that Mrs Fraisse quite rightly demonstrates the importance of sport as an important weapon against discrimination. That is why both in the European Commission and in the plan for 2003, which is the year against discrimination, the dimension of sport as a means of combating discrimination is very intensely promoted, and in 2004, which is the year of sport, the plan being drawn up takes account of the issue of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer more specifically, because of course I must say that I absolutely agree with the spirit of the analysis to which she herself referred just now, and comment on certain calls which directly concern the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that, as you know, the Convention has already answered the question of sport and the Treaty; it is clear – and no one disputes – that sport, with its social and educational dimension, like culture and education, are seen as support activities at European Union level, something which no Member State has contested. Thus we know the limits within which we can move institutionally. There is your proposal to create a 'women and sport' unit. I think that, at the present stage, it is difficult to determine the specific remit of such a unit, when there is this practical difficulty of determining competences at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as available studies and material are concerned, there is an important bibliography from the Council of Europe which, we believe, has been used from time to time and suffices for us to base positive action on it, and I believe that, in 2004 in particular, we shall have the possibility of progressing further and promoting the dimension of women's sport. Of course, we cannot sit by and do nothing while we wait for a new article in the Treaty. There is a margin and I think that we can progress further by improving information for sports associations and increasing awareness of the possibilities within the framework of existing Community programmes, for which there is minimal to no demand from sports-related associations and programmes. We might refer to the ΕQUAL programme or we might refer to the research programmes, for which no such proposals have yet been formulated, or even to the DAPHNE programme, if we think about the dimension of sexual harassment in sport, which is not at all negligible.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I would say that I agree and we shall proceed to fully support actions to encourage sports associations to use Community programmes, but I would be more cautious on issues relating to new studies or new administrative structures, at least until we have a clearer definition of activities. It is clear that the European Commission is obliged in any proposals it makes to respect the legislative action of the Member States, on the one hand, and to take account of the autonomy of sports associations, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one sure way of increasing the interest of the Member States and the sports associations is to promote sport for women as a means against discrimination. I have taken note of this in your position and would stress that sport and sports policies can clearly be used as a means of combating it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women's participation in sport has steadily increased since then, even though it could and should develop more quickly today.</p>
<p class="contents">This report focuses on women's participation in the three core areas of sport: sport in schools, sports for leisure, and competitive sport, although there are no proposals to create sporting opportunities exclusively for women in any of these areas. The principles of gender mainstreaming should apply in sport as elsewhere. Equality in sport is, in my view, the most important aspect of this report. The goal of equal opportunities for school, amateur and professional sport is above all a way of improving women’s integration at all these levels.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the importance of women's role must be recognised in sport too. Women remain under-represented in sports administration and decision-making. Why is it mainly men who are involved in club and association structures, even though more and more women are becoming members? In top-level sport, this discrepancy is becoming increasingly apparent. Here, women are not represented in the decision-making bodies in a way that is commensurate with their achievements in professional sport. On the contrary, women are in a far more difficult position in top-level sport, especially as regards the health of women athletes. The Community must take action here, and it must do so in cooperation with the various organisations involved in competitive sport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, however, to consider the principle of subsidiarity. I share the view that it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish a ‘women and sport’ unit, as is proposed. There is also no budget line which could fund such a unit, and that is why I will reject Article 5 in tomorrow's vote. I would also ask you to reject Article 32, which proposes that when the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive is amended, it should stipulate that the Member States must broadcast women’s sport competitions. There is no Europe-wide mandatory list governing the broadcasting of sporting events. The individual Member States may, if they wish, draw up their own national lists of major sporting events which attract major public interest. In my view, establishing such an obligation would result in over-regulation, which is not something that we as a group want to see. That is why we will not vote in favour of Article 32 tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraisse very warmly on her excellent report. We too endorse most of the report, and we will vote in favour of it as a whole tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport is of fundamental importance to our society. It is an all-embracing means of increasing understanding that transcends barriers of language, nationality, religion and colour. As the Olympic Games of 2004 draw nearer, sport is a wonderful means of promoting peace in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Participating in sport is like being a member of a big family. Consequently, women should never be excluded and their interests should never be sidelined. We must take both horizontal and vertical action to promote equality of access to sport for women. In other words, we must develop sport for women and girls at all levels. We must develop sport in schools, sport as a leisure activity and sport at a competitive level. We also think it is important to target all groups of women and especially those who are less able to access sport because of their lifestyle or their status.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport in schools involves more than just learning sports. It involves developing the role young people will play in society in future. Given the reticence of those young girls who drop out of sport, it is also essential to ensure young girls are more enthusiastic about doing sport. Sport is therefore about achieving emancipation and autonomy. As for sport as a leisure activity, it is clear that for many women, sport is an optional extra, that can only be considered after work, children, housework and family leisure activities. We are only too aware of the consequences this has on women’s health. In addition, our sports facilities do not always allow young women and women to participate in sport at a convenient time. Services such as childcare are not always available.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, sport is also a profession and a means of earning a living. Sports authorities and top sportspeople must therefore respect the current rules on the free movement of people and the provision of services. Women are in a minority in top-level sport and they are role models for young people. In order to encourage young girls to participate in sport, these sportswomen need to be in the public eye. In television programmes for example, they should not be relegated to second place, only appearing after other items.</p>
<p class="contents">Being involved in sport at the highest level entails many significant physical changes that have an impact on the health and future life of participants. It is important to undertake specific studies on the effects of top-level sport on the health of women. Specific physical training should also be provided for women. Lastly, it is important that women are represented in all sports regardless of the level or reason for pursuing a particular sport. It is also essential to allow women to act as referees and umpires and to ensure both genders are represented on medical and selection committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initiative should allow women to participate in a sporting activity on a regular basis, and gives special consideration to the case of disabled women, and also to the case of older women. Sport is of course an excellent means of self-development and rehabilitation. It also promotes the social integration of people of all ages, solidarity and allows people to exceed their expectations. Sport must be promoted. It will enhance our society and ensure the well-being of all. I would therefore like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraisse and the Commission for the interest they have shown in this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was only in 1964, for example, that the women’s 800 metres was introduced. It was the pressure exerted by female athletes and trainers, their irreverence and their fighting that wrung the odd concession from highly misogynistic sports organisations. They started off developments to which we are now paying tribute in the debate on this report, which I support, produced at the initiative of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, whom I congratulate on her excellent work and whom I thank for having included the proposals that I tabled. We know that there are enormous differences in the situation of women in sport in the European Union, specifically between the countries of northern and southern Europe, although the average for women (only 16%) and girls (only 37%) claiming regularly to practice a physical and sporting activity is extremely low.</p>
<p class="contents">An aspect I would therefore emphasise as being particularly important is the report’s call for women’s sport to be recognised as an expression of the right to equality and the freedom of all women to take control of their bodies and participate in sports publicly, regardless of nationality, age, disability, sexual orientation or religion. This means that the Member States and the European Union must adopt the measures necessary to guarantee women and men equal access to sporting activities at all levels and at all stages of life, regardless of social background, particularly in the case of the mentally or physically disabled, who should be encouraged to take part in sport and physical activity, as the report states. I also welcome the fact that the Commissioner has also referred to this European Year of the Disabled. I hope that it extends beyond this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence also the importance of using the various legal and financial instruments to promote and support women’s sport. Greater emphasis must also be placed on physical and sports education, on creating better conditions for female athletes and on ensuring equal rights in all areas of high-level sports, including decision-making and establishing conditions for active social reintegration at the end of the sports careers of female athletes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I did not start working in Parliament until April, the same time as the observer Members, I would like to mention them. I feel I am still a little like an observer. I now have the honour to speak in plenary for the first time, and I am happy that a subject has come my way that I feel is very personal to me, having acquired the kind of energy and invigoration that comes from a lifetime of sport. Perhaps that is the reason why we are still all in good shape here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to be able to say that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has incorporated, if not quite all, then very many of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in our committee debate. With these amendments our group has attempted to highlight the same matter that the rapporteur, Mrs Fraisse, has included to some degree in her report. Women’s sport is associated with a problem that is also familiar in the political and economic sphere: participation in decision-making. Real action on equality is needed to solve it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that sport does not just mean competitive sport, peak performance or world records. Sport and exercise for most people are ways of achieving a healthy, balanced life in a society that is ever more demanding and hectic. This is an aspect that we wish to highlight more emphatically in the report. Exercise and sport promote vitality, in both individual and team events.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a number of other matters whose importance I now wish to stress, having been given the floor. It would be very important were opportunities to participate in sport to be were stepped up for people other than those who enjoy perfect health. Sport is also a very effective, mentally therapeutic and socially beneficial way of improving the quality of life of sick and disabled people and helping them to cope in everyday life. Those who cannot walk using their own legs can ride, borrowing the legs of the horse, as it were. That is sport. Another important point to take into consideration, I think, is that ageing women and men should also be given the very same opportunities to take exercise and practise sport as the young and agile. Similarly, the beneficial effect of sport and its ability to rehabilitate cannot be stressed too much at this point. These two very important issues have now been added to the report. I would have nevertheless liked to have it emphasised rather more strongly how sport is the most wonderful way of integrating migrants, women and children, into a new society.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite everything, we are very pleased with the report and we are only asking for a few separate votes on some points. I hope special attention will be given to the fact that sport as a subject for study in school should not be judged using the same indicators as for intellectual disciplines such as foreign languages and mathematics. I would also hope the reference to sport as an individual’s fundamental right will be omitted from the report. I am of the opinion that sport is the right of all people, but I believe the concept ‘fundamental right’ would suffer inflation in this context. The report should also leave out the list naming those countries that did not send mixed teams to the last Olympic Games, although it is important to appeal to all countries to send mixed teams.</p>
<p class="contents">If this report gets through the parliamentary debate in tomorrow’s vote, as I hope it does, I will nevertheless be a little sceptical about what the Commission and the Member States will do about this matter. For that reason it would also be very important if we could have a follow-up to the report, and I now appeal to the Commissioner responsible and ask if we could have a follow-up report on the recommendations contained in this report before the current parliamentary terms ends in 2004. I would like to thank Mrs Fraisse for this report and for her passionate defence of this issue as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, times have changed a lot. Just imagine, in 1912, when the legendary Pierre de Coubertin was asked about the possibility of organising Olympic games for women he replied as follows: ‘This is impracticable, lacking in interest, anti-aesthetic and incorrect. The conception of the Olympic games must be based on the following formula: the solemn periodic manifestation of male sport based on internationalism, on loyalty as a means, on arts as a background and the applause of women as a recompense’.</p>
<p class="contents">One hundred years is not so long ago. We women did not then participate in the Olympic games, but now we make up more than 40% of participants. And if we bear in mind that there are continents for which participation is extremely low, I believe that we have truly made great progress. However, as a person who has dedicated 20 years of their life to sport, first as an amateur and then as a professional, I believe there are two fronts on which we still have an awful lot to do and a very long way to travel.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the media. In Spain we have sports newspapers, which only cover sports, and they are some of the most widely read newspapers in our country – even more than the national newspapers – and they hardly dedicate 4% of their content to women's sport, and what is more, the content relating to women's sport often consists of news of a sentimental nature or on the postures or clothing of our sportswomen. This is not just a Spanish problem. In France, the daily <span class="italic">L'Équipe</span> dedicates a maximum of 5% of its news to women's sport. It is therefore a problem which affects the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second front consists of sporting bodies. In the world of politics, we often complain that women’s participation is too low; nevertheless, I must point out that women’s participation in politics is light years ahead of their participation in sporting bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of such a dramatic situation, in 1996 the International Olympic Committee decided that, by the end of 2000, 10% of all posts in all decision-making structures should be reserved for women, including in the international federations and bodies belonging to the Olympic movement, with a view to raising this quota to 20% by 2005. These are ridiculously low quotas, but what makes the situation even more serious is that these quotas are not being achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at the closing of the First Conference on Women and Sport, in October 1996 in Lausanne, Juan Antonio Samaranch stated that the twenty-first century should be the new era for women’s participation in the world of sport. Amongst all of us, men and women, we must do everything we can to make this statement by Juan Antonio Samaranch a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is particularly important and valuable in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games and we hope that the proposals which it contains will be taken into serious account by the Athens 2004 organising committee. However, I should also like to warmly congratulate the Commissioner, who has responded directly and positively to the report's proposals. Indeed, Commissioner, sport can be a very pro-active way of combating discrimination against women and, more importantly, of combating the under-representation of women, and I think that measures should be taken in this direction in order to increase the number of women in leading positions at all levels of sports activities, to support the personal and professional development of women in the field of sport, the organisation and administration of sport and training and the organisation of sporting events at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Mechanisms need to be created which ensure that young women will have a say in the development of policies and programmes which concern them. The media need to be encouraged to positively reflect and adequately cover the breadth, depth, quality and benefits of women and girls working in sport; and, finally, support is needed to achieve the standards of equality between the sexes laid down by the International Olympic Committee in 1998 and the practical application of everything included in the Thessaloniki declaration, which closed the work of a large international conference held within the framework of the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach the 2004 Olympic Games, let us make the idea of women's participation an important message from these games. Let the Olympic Games become a real celebration of humanity which will promote the values to which women attach particular importance, the values of peace, democracy, equality, respect for differences, dialogue between cultures, the creative coexistence of people and the resolution of differences by peaceful means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That in itself is sufficient reason for an own-initiative report describing access to the practice of sport as a fundamental right, which it is quite right to do. Sport from a young age is character-building and fosters self-confidence, and for women, that always means emancipation.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport tests and overcomes personal limits, not only for the individual woman but also in the team, where together, results can be achieved which amount to far more than just the individual performances. What is more, sport teaches people how to treat others more considerately and how to involve those with a disability: an important contribution to social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it all the more incomprehensible when women are denied access to sport for social or cultural reasons. I recall the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996. At that time, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats here in this House, I objected to the discrimination by Muslim states that had prohibited women from taking part because they had refused to comply with one specific rule. They wanted to take off their headscarves and the clothing which impeded them while running. They were prevented from doing so at that time. I hope, Mrs Karamanou, that there will be no repetition of this in Athens.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you know, at that time the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats abstained in the vote in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. The main reason was that as long as we have no powers at European level, no new administration could be established in the Commission. Mrs Diamantopoulou pointed out that European funding could, however, be mobilised, for example from EQUAL or DAPHNE or research programmes. Some of the points raised were really pedantic, for example when it was claimed that opening hours at sports facilities were not in line with women's interests. We cannot make such sweeping generalisations. Quite a lot has happened. Mrs Zissener has pointed out that we cannot force the television channels to broadcast women's sporting events. However, this will be regulated by the market. I come from the media sector, and we have clearly witnessed the positive developments taking place for women here. Women are certainly not under-represented in the media now. In advertising, they have become well-established role models – such as the many female personalities from athletics, skiing, tennis or swimming – which is very gratifying. Quite rightly, they have broken down the barriers to an increasing number of sports, even women's football, which I think is a very attractive sport. There is just one sport of which I am not a fan, and that is women's boxing. Otherwise, however, major advances have been made, and that is extremely positive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point on which I am sure we all agree: now that some of the amendments we proposed are acceptable from the Group of the European People’s Party's perspective and could also be included in tomorrow's vote, we agree that wherever discrimination occurs, it must not only be identified but above all vigorously combated. Sport is undoubtedly a key area in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also agree with her that – as with everything we do – it is up to us women ourselves to improve the situation of women in sport. We must be pro-active and take the initiative here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also up to us to point out that due to the small but significant difference, namely the physical difference, gross differences in salary, substantial differences in the level of support, differences in media reporting, and the different degree to which women are involved in decision-making are all realities. That means that equality must be demanded in sport as well. That also means, for example, that in order to underline the role of gender budgeting, which is currently being dealt with by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we must review the resources available to clubs, associations and schools from an equality perspective for once. How are resources allocated between male and female competitions? How high is the expenditure on training for women and men, and what about the prize money or competition prizes? The gender aspect should be underlined in the training of trainers and teachers, and it is a must, it is absolutely essential, to demand leadership positions for women. We have already heard from our fellow Member that in international organisations in particular, virtually no progress has been made in terms of increasing women's role. I think, therefore, that the coming year – the European Year of Education through Sport – offers an opportunity to address these issues. We should raise awareness among project applicants to ensure that they also submit projects for women, and we should also urge the Commission to focus especially on these projects when making the selection, in order to send out a signal and set the right course. It is also necessary to promote new occupations, namely those that are still typically regarded as male professions, such as judges and officials, technical staff and medical staff – all these are areas where action is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about sport in schools. I do not share the view that we should give precedence to subjects such as mathematics, geography and foreign languages rather than sport. This has already been happening for a long time. Whenever savings have to be made, sport is always the first thing to go. Sport and the arts are always dropped first. This is, in my view, a very bad thing. We are doing it again in Austria at present: we are currently cutting the school timetable by two hours, and sport is one of the things to go. This is unacceptable, for sport does not only have an educational and social value, it is also important for health, and we should not deprive our children and young people of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by making one further point, if I may. I realise that I am over-running, but I would like to make this point to you. We have been talking about the media, and we cannot force them into reporting. That is true, but we do need to emphasise the importance of reporting in a serious-minded way. For example, when the City Marathon took place in January, Austrian Broadcasting (ORF) played ‘You Sexy Thing’ as the female winner approached the finishing line. The camera zoomed in on the relevant parts of the women's bodies. This is completely inappropriate in serious sports reporting. This type of discrimination against women still occurs, with the focus being not on their performance but merely on their gender and their bodies. This is something we need to protest about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of male golfers reacted with suspicion and antipathy, and others rejected the idea outright. The men wondered what was to happen now. Perhaps she was better than some of them. The reaction encountered by Annika Sörenstam when she wanted to measure her ability against the men is symptomatic of many men’s attitudes to women and sport. Not that I believe that men in general actively conspire against women in sport, although there are some who do so. What is done through thoughtlessness and prejudice has the same effect, however. Women are discriminated against in sport. That is something that emerges very clearly from Mrs Fraisse’s, in my view, quite excellent report. Women obtain fewer resources and shorter training periods and are quite often treated unfairly by sponsors. Moreover, it is often men who call the shots in sport. To this should be added precisely what many others have already said, namely that the media devote more space to men than to women.</p>
<p class="contents">I am president of a sports association: the Järnvägen Handball Club in Hallsberg. It is a club with a fair degree of equality in terms of its membership, with approximately as many girls and women as boys and men. We have worked single-mindedly to create equal opportunities for girls and boys. I will not say that we have succeeded fully, but we have made a fair bit of progress. A lot still remains to be done, and we have to make an effort in our handball club. All other sports associations must also make an effort and single-mindedly work for an environment of equality in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is significant in many ways. It is almost always beneficial and healthy for those who practise it. It creates opportunities for social contact and for being together and helps people flourish. Through sport, we can combat drugs and exclusion and give people room to grow and develop, but everyone – girls as well as boys, women as well as men – must have the same opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament cannot remove all the causes of the lack of equality in sport, any more than we can remove such causes in other areas of society. We can, however, be clear about what we want, and we can encourage ourselves, the Member States, sports associations, the media and those who participate in sport always to think in terms of equality and equal conditions for women and men. The Member States can be tougher in the action they take. There can be a halt to subsidies paid to associations that do not fulfil objectives in terms of equality. Sponsors can exercise pressure on clubs. If they do not practise equality, they do not receive any money. There must, therefore, be the will to bring about equality in sport. Where there is a will, there is a way. Let us make use of that will to bring about equality in European sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
