<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fox,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the United Mexican States.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am honoured to be here and have the opportunity of addressing the plenary of the European Parliament, which represents the democratic will of thousands of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The pluralistic nature of this institution bears witness to the cultural and political diversity of the European Union, and is a noteworthy example of the heights our civilisation has reached. It also provides tangible evidence of the role democratic institutions can play. Such institutions emerge from the heat of the citizens’ struggle. They are forged by a sustained effort and commitment inspired by a vision of the future. They allow for unity in diversity and, even more importantly, they promote a genuine feeling of community and steady shared development.</p>
<p class="contents">Many different roads meet in this beautiful European city. In the same way, different trains of thought come together in the melting pot of this institution. This mix has proved the key to the successful outcome of the difficult process of gestation required to bring forth the sense of European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a role beyond the frontiers of Europe. Through its action and example it has been instrumental in promoting the defence of democratic principles and human rights the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Mexico, this House has played a leading part in strengthening and developing the relationship between my country and the European Union. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the House for its steadfast support of the process that enabled millions of Mexican men and women to bring about a change to democracy in our country.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the determination of its citizens, Mexico now enjoys unprecedented freedoms and a robust and well-established democracy. In Mexico as in Europe, the exercise of democracy requires a wide range of forces to come together. The various political groupings, individuals and non-governmental organisations, businessmen and public servants are called upon to work together towards a common goal, namely the viable sustainable development of our country, within the framework of strict observance of the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mexico tended the young shoots of its democracy and they have now grown into a strong and well-rooted tree. It welcomes us all into its shade, especially those previously sidelined and excluded: children, women and the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2 July 2000, I have been committed to guiding the Mexican people along the new course they have set for themselves. It sets forth from democracy and the Rule of Law and leads to a future of shared prosperity, fairness and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my priorities in office has therefore been to ensure that the actions of each and every one of my Government’s officials are utterly honest and entirely transparent. Any allegation of corruption is now investigated and dealt with severely as provided for in law. The services monitoring and supervising public expenditure have been strengthened. We are determined to root out corruption as it hinders development and weakens democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, integrity and accountability alone cannot suffice. I require public servants to respond efficiently and effectively to the economic and social needs of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Early results are already evident. Mexico now has a stable economy. Inflation was 4.4% in 2001 and is still falling. Interest rates are at a record low of 6%. Enterprise and growth are therefore being fostered and more jobs created. Last year was a difficult one for the economy but unemployment was only 2.5%. A legal framework is in place providing extensive legal guarantees for investment. Significant resources are also being devoted to modernising infrastructure and to energy generation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the realm of social services, my Government has carried through wide-ranging programmes to improve the levels of health and education of vast numbers of citizens, especially those living in the poorest areas of the country. I should like to mention one example. Last year, in addition to providing the free state education system, we awarded over 4 million grants to children and young people nationwide. A further 1 million are to be awarded this year. This makes up a total of 5 million grants, 300 000 of which are aimed specifically at young people from the indigenous communities, at young people from poor families, to allow them to attend university. 500 000 new homes are to be built this year, an increase of 50% on last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the political scene, I can assure you that a system of checks and balances is now established in Mexico. No longer are the legislative and judiciary only nominally independent as was the case in the past. They are now but genuinely so. This is evidenced by the complete independence the Congress demonstrated in dealing with the various initiatives passed to it by the executive. The judiciary has demonstrated the same independence, resolving constitutional disputes between the legislative and executive powers. This was previously unheard of.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of technological and scientific development is another important challenge. The aim is to stimulate economic and social development. A number of much-needed changes have been set in train with the cooperation of representatives of the scientific community and private ventures. Decentralisation is one of these. Increased investment with an undertaking to reach 1% of Gross Domestic Product is another. Most importantly, incentives have been created to encourage companies and researchers to invest in this strategically important area.</p>
<p class="contents">The indigenous communities represent a further major challenge. They account for 10 million Mexican citizens. The law on the rights and culture of the indigenous peoples was passed with them in mind. It has broken new ground and is now the most advanced legislation in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the start of the troubles in Chiapas, this House has been making its concern felt about the situation in that part of Mexico. It has repeatedly called for the rights of indigenous peoples to be respected, especially their human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My Government has given clear evidence of its political will to continue dialogue with the Zapatista movement. The protection we provided during the march to Mexico City is ample proof of this. During my time in office we have sought to defuse the situation. A number of investment and development programmes have been launched, together with programmes aimed at meeting the needs of indigenous communities across the nation. I welcome the European Union’s support for this process. In particular, I should like to express my gratitude for the statement made last year recognising the Mexican Government’s efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have set in train constitutional reform relating to the culture and rights of the indigenous peoples, with a view to making further progress in protecting the rights of these communities. This underlines our determination to achieve full respect for the human rights of each and every Mexican. The process was complemented by a campaign to promote respect of these fundamental rights the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should like to highlight that from the outset we declared ourselves to be a humanist government. We have adopted a clear and resolute policy to promote human rights. It is a two-pronged policy. Firstly, it aims to promote support and cooperation by international bodies and the international community to assist with all those actions designed to bring about the necessary changes in areas where we might have fallen behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it aims to ensure that human rights are recognised as fundamental values of a universal nature, and to promote them as such in the international arena. Mexico has therefore determined to play an active role in various international fora. In particular I could mention the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, where Mexico is certainly pulling its weight. It is contributing to the effectiveness of international monitoring in this field, and helping to ensure worldwide recognition of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern for respect for human rights within our borders and beyond has led us to mount a sustained attack in defence of Mexicans working in the United States, regardless of their status as immigrants. We are also actively defending the rights of Mexicans condemned to death in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the laudable work undertaken by the European Parliament in favour of the abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are deeply grateful too for the support received in connection with the case of Gerardo Valdés in the State of Oklahoma. His life was eventually spared thanks to your action, ladies and gentlemen, and to action taken by Mexico. Together with millions of Europeans, we Mexicans believe that depriving a human being of life, regardless of the nature of his or her offence, is a violation of the most fundamental right of all. It amounts to an attack on the dignity of mankind itself, and places public authorities on the same footing as criminals as far as violence is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of democracy as the optimum form of government, respect for human rights and fostering viable sustainable development of all peoples are the main pillars of Mexican foreign policy as conducted by my Government. Through our foreign policy we aim to play a part in creating the international structures societies will need in the new millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">In signing up to the Inter American Democratic Charter in September last year, Mexico allied itself with those other nations in our hemisphere determined to defend democracy in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In our role as rotating member of the United Nations Security Council we are contributing to the building of new structures that should be better able to safeguard peace and international security.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations’ Conference on Development Funding held recently in the city of Monterrey in Mexico, is further proof of our strong desire to play a leading role in establishing a fairer international system which would offer new opportunities to less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Interdependence is the defining characteristic of the world we live in. Only if we pool our efforts will we succeed in these and other ventures concerning environmental protection, combating drug trafficking and the illegal trade in arms, intellectual property and human beings, the fight against abject poverty and ensure world-wide compliance with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">We are called on to work alongside other nations, parliamentary groups, civil organisations, research centres, families and individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all jointly responsible for our future, which will of necessity be a shared future. I am therefore convinced, to paraphrase José Martí, that we should now adopt the ‘diplomacy of the peoples’. After all, what eventually endures is the impression made on each citizen’s conscience by knowledge, human contact and concern for each other. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has proposed a new outline regional development plan, the Puebla-Panama Plan. It involves seven Central American countries and eight states in southern and south-eastern Mexico. The areas concerned are characterised by abject poverty and underdevelopment. Development is urgently required. This plan exemplifies my government’s explicit recognition that given the economic and political conditions now prevailing in the twenty-first century, it is not enough simply to update development policy. It is essential to transcend national boundaries and we are committed to doing so. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to request European Parliament support for this exercise in regional integration. The plan will make it possible for all the American states in the central band of the continent, namely the area between Puebla and Panama, to move forward towards robust development, combat poverty and promote education and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union/Latin America and Caribbean Summit is due to be held in Madrid in the near future. I am sure it will prove an excellent opportunity to assess the range of problems our regions are faced with from a bi-regional perspective. It will also be possible to discuss how best to try and work together to overcome the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the European Parliament’s decision to adopt a proposal aimed at setting up a global association and a joint strategy for the European Union with Latin America and the Caribbean. Together with my fellow Heads of State I will study the proposal carefully at the Madrid meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stand before you today, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate my country’s determination to strengthen its links with Europe. I refer not only to links with the institutions but also to the relationship with each one of its constituent countries, regions and communities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my pleasure to inform you that in the first two years of its existence the Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and the European Union has proved a success. The balance of trade has increased at least by 18%. This was at a time when last year, for instance, exports to other regions failed to grow due to global recession. We are therefore hopeful and optimistic and believe this is a very promising relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">As a country, Mexico gained much from the various civilisations that arose on our soil or came together on it. Like Europe, Mexico was and is a meeting point where a variety of cultures converge. Like Europe too, Mexico affirms its identity through the diversity and cultural mix through which it is empowered and enriched.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust you will accept my invitation to extend our exchanges. We must move our relationship forward. Only then can we play our proper part in supporting Mexico, a country now committed to its age, and supporting Europe, now a world leader.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us build a shared and prosperous future on the foundations of our present democratic achievements. We must realise that our neighbour’s good is also our own good. If we are bold and are prepared to make an effort, we can surely build a better future, the future we deserve. </p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention.</p>
