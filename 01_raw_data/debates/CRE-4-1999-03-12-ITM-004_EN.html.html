<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">André‐Léonard </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ‘We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us". These were the words of Nehru to the Constituent Assembly of the Indian Union on 14 August 1947, a few hours before the proclamation of India"s independence. He continued in words which are still relevant today: ‘The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity".</p>
<p class="contents">For fifty years India has pursued these objectives with determination. Although illiteracy, poverty and disease have not been eradicated since independence was proclaimed, enormous progress has been made. In 1947, three‐quarters of the population lived below the poverty line. Life expectancy at birth was 32 years whereas now this has nearly doubled to 62 years. Illiteracy affected 84 % of the population whereas now over half of the population can read. The country depended on external aid for agricultural production whereas now, thanks to the green revolution of the 1960s, India is self‐sufficient in terms of food. The major famines are no more than a bad memory, even though much still remains to be done to save many children from malnutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of population growth, the most pessimistic experts who thought that India could not control this have been proven wrong. However, the figures reveal a population of 970 million, compared with 350 million in 1947, and the World Bank estimates the number of Indians will reach 1.3 billion by 2025, thus exceeding the population of China. The population issue must therefore be a social and economic priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of this decade, India has embraced liberalisation. It has offered enormous markets and hoped for foreign investors but these have not appeared due to a protectionist commercial policy which imposes hefty customs duties and quantitative restrictions. Yet economic and commercial reforms have allowed India to increase its participation in the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, India can be proud that it is the largest parliamentary democracy in the world. A new government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the last elections in March 1998. On entering office, Prime Minister Attal Vajpayee announced his declared intention to make India a nuclear power. By conducting several tests in May last year, the Hindu nationalists of the BJP have tried to implement an independent nuclear policy, breaking with the previous policy of not exercising its nuclear option which had been maintained for nearly a quarter of a century. The people were perhaps surprised but not so the international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">These events had the effect of suspending the progress of my report for several months. The final text calls on India to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the nuclear Non‐Proliferation Treaty (NPT). We also consider it essential to restart the dialogue between India and Pakistan in order to come to a peaceful solution on the question of Kashmir. We are also calling for the continuation of dialogue on disarmament in these two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed partnership agreement is part of a new generation of agreements aimed at redefining the external action of the European Union. India was one of the first countries to establish relations with the Union and since 1973 three agreements have been signed, initially defining commercial relations and then establishing an institutional framework for economic cooperation and development. The present partnership will go much further. It proposes an intensified political dialogue between the two parties, the abolition of barriers to investment and trade and measures promoting cultural contacts and a permanent dialogue with civil society. Other elements in the partnership"s agenda include the preservation of biodiversity and the fight against drugs and money‐laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">My report also concentrates on development aid which represents 95 % of the European aid granted to India. The abolition of child labour is also one of the priorities and, where this cannot be avoided, a voluntary code of conduct for companies is recommended. As the victims of age‐old prejudice, women suffer every form of exploitation. Furthermore, India is one of the few countries in the world where there are more men than women. This is why the budget for basic health care has been increased. Education for girls is of crucial importance since the figures show that educated women are at less risk from maternal and infant mortality.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many clichés abound. To associate India with shantytowns, extreme poverty and nothing else is too simplistic. We hope that the EU‐India dialogue will allow India to assume its rightful place on the world stage and that it will allow our Asia strategy to be revised so that it is not solely targeted at China.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Bladel </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, along with China, India is one of the biggest and most important states on the Asian continent. I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has done such an excellent job of promoting stronger partnership with India. It is a rising economic power attracting private investment, and it is somewhere where my own country, the Netherlands, for example, has a good deal of its administrative work done by local companies because of their technical know‐how and because the wage levels are lower. Nevertheless, India with its large population still needs a great deal of development aid. The interesting thing about India is that it is a subcontinent with an impressive culture, and it is this culture which, in the context of development cooperation, has prevented it from simply putting itself in the hands of the donor countries, as has happened with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, for example. India is still in charge of policy in this field, which is a good thing to see. Unfortunately, this mentality is also something of an obstacle, particularly for the further liberalisation of its trade system. Strengthening links with India through top‐level dialogue, as the Commission is proposing, could encourage movement in the right direction here, enabling this country with its established democracy to play a major role in the WTO. All things considered, India has suffered less than expected from the economic crisis in Asia. The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> reported this week that the Indian telephone company has reduced call rates by 10 %, and by even more for international calls. I think this is remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are still some rather worrying developments, as the rapporteur said: child labour, increasing religious tensions, partly caused by Hindu nationalists, the conflict in Kashmir and, of course, the developments on the nuclear front. Developments in neighbouring China are also worrying, but India could one day act as a counterbalance between the ASEAN countries, China and Japan, which would be a good thing. The recent meeting between India and Pakistan was also a welcome development. All of these issues can be put on the agenda if there is a stronger partnership between India and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former journalist, vice‐chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and member of the friendship association with India, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the case of a missing Indian journalist, Ram Singh. India promised in 1997 to provide information on this man, but up to now we have heard nothing. I hope that the Indian diplomats here can do so. My group supports the partnership and we congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Holm </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, in my opinion India is a country which has possibilities for the future. I am pleased that the EU is willing to continue and strengthen the partnership we have had for a long time and which, let us hope, will continue for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Many think that India is a strange country which is difficult to get to know. And so it is, if we see it through Western eyes. But that is not how we should see it; we should look at India from within and with different eyes. Then we shall discover that India is a unique country. I for one, on many of my journeys, have experienced incredible sympathy and generosity, which seem to know no bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, apart from the positive aspects, there are also many development problems in India. We must of course endeavour to help India in every possible way to take the right road, not because we want to control the country, but because we do not want it to make the same mistakes as many countries in Europe have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on a few points here – I will not go through them all since Mrs André‐Léonard has already raised many important points, which I of course entirely support. One of the comments I wish to make concerns regional cooperation in India and with countries around India. Regional cooperation is indeed of very great importance for the entire region, where India as the largest country clearly has a special position. None of these countries can isolate itself entirely. If a solution is to be found to many of the problems present in the region, problems with Pakistan and the Kashmir question for example, regional cooperation is of the utmost importance. I also think that India increasingly realises and understands that. Increased intergovernmental cooperation is therefore a precondition for the region to achieve positive development in terms of peace, the environment and balancing out economic and social differences in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the nuclear tests, we all had a great shock when we heard that India, immediately followed by Pakistan, had carried out test explosions. It sounded to me very much like the most stupid thing which India had done for a long time. This is definitely not the way to secure cooperation and trust. Nor does it square with the picture of India I have acquired and of the country I have got to know over many years. My group and I of course condemn these nuclear tests. Clearly we urge India to sign and ratify the nuclear test ban and non‐proliferation treaties, and of course also the ban on anti‐personnel mines, as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kashmir question is also important. Here we come back to regional cooperation, which I believe can play a major role. We hope of course that a peaceful solution can be found. Progress has also been made in recent times. The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan recently met in Pakistan to discuss the question. It was the first time in a great many years that an Indian Prime Minister had set foot in Pakistan. We have also tabled an amendment to the André‐Léonard report on this, which I hope you can support.</p>
<p class="contents">We have discussed freedom of religion in Parliament many times, most recently during the February part‐session. Regrettably, a very long list can be compiled of attacks and violence against religious minorities in India. Unfortunately, there are repeated occurrences, despite the fact that the Indian Constitution guarantees religious freedom. There are of course also a number of provisions to protect human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of human rights, we must not forget that India still has the death penalty, which is unworthy of a democracy. I therefore truly hope that India will abolish this sanction as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">India has also still not signed the Convention on torture. It is of course important too that this should be done as soon as possible. We get repeated reports, from Amnesty International among others, that torture is going on in India. Serious cases of torture have also occurred in the police. I hope that India can sign this convention and that it will endeavour to solve these problems as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Green Group have tabled an amendment precisely on this human rights issue, mainly in regard to the many unsolved cases which have arisen in relation to Kashmir; it is estimated that there have been over 800 unsolved cases since 1990. Of course this is to impress upon India that it must make progress in resolving this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the environment, the problem is that India has nuclear power. These nuclear power stations were obtained from the Soviet Union, which does not give any guarantee for the future. I therefore hope that we can have greater cooperation on renewable energy resources so that nuclear power can be phased out in India, just as we want to phase it out in the EU countries. Renewable energy resources show very great potential in India, especially where wind and solar energy are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we in the Green Group will of course support this partnership and will vote for the excellent André‐Léonard report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dupuis </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Leon Brittan always tells us that there is no alternative to his policy of kowtowing and exaggerated politeness on the red carpets of Beijing. He claims that there is no alternative to this policy which is based on sacrificing democracy, the rule of law and the freedom of the Tibetans, the Mongols and the inhabitants of Turkestan. He says that there is no alternative to the negation of human rights and to the Chinese gulags.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we now have an alternative as indicated in this report by Mrs André‐Léonard which is heading in the right direction. For India is the alternative for the European Union and its Asia policy. A true strategic partnership should be established with this great country of a billion inhabitants, compared with 1.2 billion in China. India is the largest democracy in the world and a country which, under the government of Mr Vajpayee, has not changed considerably since the government of Mr Rao. Substantial economic reforms have been initiated and just as substantial economic progress has been made. The country is opening up to the world market, albeit still too slowly, and is strengthening its relations with the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">So should we continue to follow Sir Leon when he tell us that there is no alternative? Or should we, the Commission, the Council and this House, make an effort to establish a programme which will allow us to rapidly instigate a strategic relationship with this country?</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a long way to go. The Commission delegation in Delhi is totally inadequate. This House does not even have an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation with India, although it does have one with the Chinese Communist empire. There is also no annual EU‐India summit. This House, and the Council and the Commission in particular, need a genuine strategy and measures which will allow us to be suitably equipped to meet this major challenge of ensuring India"s progress towards increased democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and certain Members have broached this problem, we must not look for excuses or pay attention to the problem of the nuclear tests in India. India is quite rightly equipping itself with the means to protect itself, just as we did faced with the Soviet empire. Why should we be so tolerant of the nuclear strike force of the Chinese Communist empire and yet make such a fuss because India, whose problem is not really with Pakistan but with the neighbouring Communist empire, equips itself with a deterrent power. When the situation changed for us with the collapse of the Soviet empire and the lessening of the threat, we were able to start to disarm.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that India, faced with such a country, has the legitimate right to equip itself with the means to protect itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I must congratulate Mrs André‐Léonard on her report which contains some positive elements. The ball is now in the Commission"s and Council"s court to establish a strategic timetable with the Indian Parliament and the Indian Government so that India can become our favoured partner in Asia.</p>

This is particularly true when you compare, for example, the emphasis given to our relations with China. The refusal to discuss this report at the end of the sitting seems rather cavalier given that this is such an important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">This report paints a fairly full picture of India"s current situation. This young democratic country has for some years been experiencing a sustained rate of growth and yet, in practice, the democracy seems to be built on extremely inegalitarian social structures. The persistence of a caste system which the public authorities have not managed to challenge is at the root of an unfair distribution of benefits from the country"s growth. The recent violations of human rights, in particular the violation of religious freedom to the detriment of the Christian communities, as in neighbouring Pakistan, are also worrying and may not have been sufficiently stressed by our rapporteur. Furthermore, the economic development of India is still based too much on industries which use underpaid and exploited labour, in particular child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The external commercial policy of the European Union must help to correct these problems by providing the instruments needed to promote fair trade. It must encourage the overall level of production standards in India to be raised and must seek to reduce as much as possible the unscrupulous trade in products which are only competitive because of unacceptable social and health conditions. A policy restricted to establishing codes of conduct would be doomed to ineffectiveness. Europe"s action within the WTO must pursue the same objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur"s recommendations on the necessary diversification of our aid programmes, on their decentralisation, on improved capillary action and on the extension of micro‐loans seem relevant because they are well suited to the social and geographic structures of India. If applied, they should help to improve the effectiveness of these structures.</p>

This report clearly addresses the priority areas, the acute problems and those that are more deeply rooted. A great deal has already been said, and quite rightly, about the nuclear tests, but I nevertheless believe that the development of the partnership has to depend upon the decisions made in this area. It is also important for India to sign the Ottawa Convention banning anti‐personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is particularly important for the EU, both in its overall partnership policy and in its relations with India, to be significantly involved in the fight against the exploitation of children. The contradictions between legislation in this field and the way it is implemented in India are far too great. It is also quite staggering that such technologically gifted people – I am thinking here of the software sector, for example – allow their children to be socially and sexually exploited to such a dreadful extent. Campaigns run by the central government have failed due to the resistance of organised crime and corruption and the lack of flanking measures. The extreme suffering caused to children forced into prostitution, particularly those from Nepal, is quite simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the proposal in paragraph 44, based on an initiative taken by President Clinton, is a constructive approach which may give some practical substance to European concern about the exploitation of children. Firms would have to agree voluntarily to comply with certain minimum criteria in return for a fixed payment or bonus. Implementing and policing this would certainly require some degree of political will and administrative expenditure, but it would be a definite signal and would hold out the prospect of achieving progress.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I want to start by speaking from a specifically British viewpoint on India. One of the arguments that was always put against British membership of the European Union was that it would mean that we would be turning our backs on the Commonwealth and that Europe was an inward‐looking small club of rich nations that did not care about the rest of the world. I always argued very strongly against that viewpoint in the 60s and 70s and argued that one of the great advantages of British membership of the European Union was precisely that it would bring the Commonwealth countries into a relationship with the rest of Europe, with all the advantages that could bring.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we have before us today is a very good example of what precisely has happened. Not only has the Commonwealth benefited by being brought into the Lomé Convention but also individual partnerships have been formed, such as the one we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mrs André‐Léonard very strongly on her excellent report which sets out very comprehensively the many social and political issues which face India. We know there are problems. The subcontinent of India has enormous potential but, as has been pointed out, many problems and tensions to be tackled particularly in its relationships with its immediate neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as has been shown by this particular resolution, can engage very constructively with India, which is the biggest democracy in the world and which, for all its problems, remains a very strong and vibrant democracy after over 50 years of independence. I would like to thank all the colleagues who have participated in this debate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Günther </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs André‐Léonard, I too would like to thank you for the very thorough piece of work you have submitted to us. The rapporteur quite rightly points out that India is an established democracy, and indeed one hardly dares imagine what the whole region would look like without this stabilising factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the report hands out rather too much good advice for my liking. Of course we should, for instance, condemn the attacks by religious fanatics, but this is what the Indian government does anyway, and we should not forget that leading Indian politicians have fallen victim to such fanatics. We should therefore and above all look at supporting India in a very positive way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two further points. Firstly, one of the proposed amendments quite rightly calls for the delegation in India to be reinforced. That is however just one side of the story. Cooperation between the Commission and the delegation would also need to improve, as it is not acceptable for aid‐workers on the spot to be kept waiting for nine months before they get the first instalment of funding for their projects and to have to borrow money from other projects and other aid organisations until European Union resources are finally made available. In instances of cofinancing it is particularly difficult to explain to a partner why they should provide their contribution whilst those on the European side drag their feet.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I very much welcome the fact that some of the previous speakers also called for improved cooperation in the high‐tech sector, for this is indeed the technology of the future for India, but if we do this I think we should nonetheless refrain from asking the Commission to draw up a code of conduct; I feel this is not a job for the Commission but for other organisations to do.</p>

As documented in our new external strategy from 1995, we in Europe have a vital interest in fostering close relations based on shared values, fair partnership, economic cooperation with direct effects on jobs, and support for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In meetings I had over there, including in my capacity as vice‐chairman of the European Parliament"s SAARC Delegation, I was able to see for myself the quality of the reforms. It is remarkable how stable India has remained in the midst of Asia"s economic crisis thanks to its economic strength and innovative capacity. The restructuring of the banking system and financial services and the expansion of the South Asia free trade area will be further important developments. Nonetheless, as Mrs André‐Léonard has already stated in her well‐balanced report, our dialogue should not deal solely with economic matters. Respect for human rights is an essential basis for all European Union agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against child labour can only be won if state authorities get actively involved, if a minimum income is guaranteed, if parents do their bit to ensure that their children are not reduced to the status of cheap and willing drudges. Children must be able to attend school to get the education and training that will give them a future. Village cooperative societies, micro‐loans for women and NGO initiatives such as rugmark need our support. Companies too must make their contribution by means of voluntary agreements to safeguard social standards. The democracy so close to our hearts means respecting other religious persuasions as well. There is no room for totalitarian philosophies. Establishments in which people practise their religion must be protected against physical violence and threat just as ethnic minorities should be. The words of Prime Minister Vajpayee need to be acted upon further.</p>
<p class="contents">The partnership between the largest state of the SAARC community and the European Union should be of high quality, built up through exchanges of young people, information and of course high tech, networks and a whole range of other experiences, involving political parties and parliaments as well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and in particular of Vice‐President Marín, I wish to warmly thank Parliament for having persevered with the work on the Commission's communication of June 1996 on an enhanced partnership with India, despite all the difficulties encountered. I should like to particularly congratulate Mrs André‐Léonard, who never tired in her efforts to bring this project to a positive conclusion. I also thank her colleagues, Mr Rocard and Mr Malerba and the many honourable Members who have contributed through their questions, contributions in debate, observations and proposals for amendments, to assuring that the final outcome is both comprehensive and of high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the unfortunate events of May last year, when India took the world by surprise and decided to reconduct nuclear tests after almost a quarter of a century. There was a need for the European Union, especially the European Parliament, to observe closely events as they evolved and incorporate them fully into the analysis of our relations with India. This has delayed the completion of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, all the institutions of the European Union reacted to these events in a balanced manner. The message to both India and Pakistan was firm and simple, namely, that for the European Union, the principle of nuclear non‐proliferation is non‐negotiable. This is, again, made very clear in the text of the resolution before us. While emphasising principles, there is no alternative to pursuing the immediate priority objectives: lowering tensions and preventing an arms race on the subcontinent. In the long term we must make every effort to reintegrate India and Pakistan into the non‐proliferation system.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of India in particular there is no alternative to dialogue. India is the second most populous country on this globe, with a proud and tested democratic tradition. Democracy has enabled India to preserve its unity, despite an ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity that is even more varied than in our European Union. Sanctions would likely have fed frustrations, reinforced the radical sectors in Indian society and shut out the country even further from international efforts towards building a global security system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly emphasises the legitimacy of India's aspirations to be recognised as a global player. Few developing, even developed, countries could stand the strain of preserving a comparable democratic routine in the face of challenges as daunting as India's. The nuclear tests have certainly given India worldwide attention, but for the wrong reasons. Indeed, they may well have set back India's global aspirations. On the other hand, there are aspects of global concern which cannot be tackled successfully without a contribution by the giant India. I will not list them here as they are so clearly identified in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The current level and depths of our political relations with India still do not reflect the fact that the European Union is India's most important and only growing export market, its first source of investment and technology and also its principal aid donor. However, in high‐level meetings, as in our daily contacts with our partners, we are confronted with the fact that the European Union is little understood in India and its role hardly acknowledged. This applies to all levels of Indian society, including the government.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to put our political relationship with India on a footing that reflects not only the importance of our economic relations but also the status of both the EU and India as global players, it is imperative that we work on increasing our visibility in India. I, therefore, welcome your support towards setting up a press and information unit in the Commission's delegation in New Delhi, as is already the case in other major capitals. Already we seem to be gaining some ground in this aspect. Our decision to maintain dialogue following the nuclear tests and to expand dialogue into new areas is contributing to enhancing our profile. The euro has received, and continues to receive, extensive coverage in the Indian media. I, therefore, very much welcome the proposal contained in the resolution that the European Parliament take on a more active role in maintaining regular dialogue with its Indian counterpart and that Parliament be given the resources to do so effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">India is not only a democracy in name but also a living and vibrant democratic body politic with a free and fiercely competitive press which has the largest combined circulation worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">Indians are proud of their traditions and especially sensitive about their democratic credentials. We must take into account these sensitivities when adopting declarations, especially when exhorting India on the issue of minority rights and human rights in general.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not imply that dialogue with India on matters relating to human rights is not possible. It is not only possible, but also highly desirable. The Commission does not, and never has, side‐stepped its responsibilities in this field. The Commission is convinced that dialogue at all levels, including an intensified dialogue between India's civil society and the EU and its respective institutions, which must also include Parliament, is the only way forward. However, we are not convinced that public declarations would not have the opposite effect; namely, make such dialogue more difficult, at least in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Last January the 10th EC/India Joint Commission Meeting was held in Brussels. On this occasion we formally launched the high‐level economic dialogue between India and the EU. We are convinced that this is the way forward to building confidence and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote on the House's report on an enhanced EU/India partnership is very timely. I should like to thank the House for its tremendous effort. It is reassuring to know that we have the support of Parliament in this extraordinary venture of building our relationship with this great country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was interested in the interventions of those, including Mr Dupuis, who strongly underlined the need to institute an annual EU/India summit. We believe this proposal deserves serious consideration in a constructive spirit. I believe this reflection should build on, in particular, two sets of elements: on the one hand, the already existing mechanisms which have been set up including an annual ministerial meeting at Troika‐level, senior officials meeting, strategy planners meeting, consultations in the margins of multilateral fora and a series of working groups. Despite the hiatus imposed by the nuclear tests, we have been working hard to make these mechanisms fully operational. The second context in which the idea of an annual EU/India summit should be considered is the evolution in the structures concerning common security and foreign policy that the Amsterdam Treaty is about to bring into force very soon.</p>
