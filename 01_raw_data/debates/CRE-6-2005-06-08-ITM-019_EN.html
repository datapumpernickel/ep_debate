The European Union and Member States lose many hundreds, if not billions, of euros every year due to the loss of excise, VAT and customs revenue from the illicit black market trade in tobacco products. Every container of smuggled cigarettes is costing the European and national authorities lost income to the tune of EUR 1.5 million. During 1995 and 1996, the European Parliament took the lead in the fight against this type of fraud and set up an enquiry committee, which, with John Tomlinson as chairman and Edward Kellett-Bowman as rapporteur, catalogued the problems that occurred during transit and proposed solutions to them. The enquiry committee went to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam where it carefully studied the fraud techniques which criminal organisations, often of a Mafia-like nature, used to evade normal tax obligations. Let me reiterate that these practices are characteristic of the Mafia, and, over the past few years, they have claimed people’s lives; murders have been committed, officials intimidated and bribed, and in some cases, politicians were working hand in glove with the criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent work by the enquiry committee, the research work of our anti-fraud services Uclaf and Olaf, the Cigarette Fraud Task Force and the careful cooperation between customs and police services are now resulting in major networks being rounded up. In November 2000, the Community lodged a civil complaint before the Court of New York against Philip Morris and Reynolds on account of suspected involvement in the smuggling of cigarettes into the European Union. Ten Member States joined this lawsuit between January and April 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The bare facts that were brought during the debates before the court against Philip Morris forced the tobacco giant to sign a settlement with the European Commission. This multi-annual agreement was signed on 9 July 2004 and aims to fight the smuggling and counterfeiting of cigarettes in an effective manner. At the same time, it puts an end to the legal dispute between the European Union and Philip Morris. The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris will be paying considerable amounts – as high as USD 1.5 billion – into a bank account managed by the European Commission over a 12-year period. It represents a departure in terms of anti-fraud policy and ensures that Philip Morris and the European authorities can combine their efforts and work together more closely. It is likely that this innovative approach will lead to similar agreements being concluded with the other two main tobacco giants 'British American Tobacco' and 'Japan Tobacco' within the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary authority in the European Union has two arms, namely the Council of Ministers and Parliament. As Members of Parliament, we are extremely anxious about the way in which the Commission and Member States will handle this unexpected, but considerable windfall. According to high-level officials within the Council, the lion’s share of Philip Morris’s funds will end up in the coffers of national Member States. Apparently, 10% will go to the Commission, while the ten Member States that joined the lawsuit will receive 90%. Can the Council and the Commission confirm this distribution?</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it does indeed look like the Member States are behaving like grasping opportunists and mediocre accountants. To me, the 10%-90% split seems to underestimate the efforts on the part of the Commission and Olaf, for what will happen with those funds? In actual fact they should mainly be used to combat fraud. I am very aware that the so-called earmarking of certain funds for specific activities is considered undesirable by the budgetary authority, but it strikes me as only fair that the Council and the Commission make the political commitment to this Parliament to using a considerable proportion of this sum to fight fraud and counterfeiting. Is the Commission prepared to suggest an action plan and a proposal for a budget line to tackle this issue? So much can be done, including more cross-border cooperation, more computers at borders, more and well-trained inspection staff, reinforcement of customs services, investments in tracing and tracking, more effective follow-up policy and extra manpower for Olaf.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore focus on spending funds and not solely on splitting them up. This is not just about whose money it is; we should also look for value for money. I am also expecting a progress report from the Commission, possibly behind closed doors, about the negotiations with British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, only on this basis and on the basis of the agreements we conclude can we continue the debate. From the Council, we expect ideas that transcend the bookkeepers’ mentality and proposals on spending this money wisely. What is the response to this from the Council and the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can also confirm to the honourable Member the Council’s full agreement with the need to step up the fight against all types of contraband which have developed in recent years. In that context we should also welcome the agreement between the Commission, ten Member States and the Philip Morris company.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the allocation and use of the amount you refer to, and which appears fair to me, I should point out that this is an agreement entered into by the Commission and ten Member States, which means that the Council, as an institution, is not a party to the matter. However, I can tell you that discussions between the Commission and these ten Member States on the allocation of the funds have already begun. I can assure you that, in the excellent spirit of cooperation between our institutions, the Council will ensure you are kept fully informed of developments on this matter, on the basis of information supplied to us.</p>
<p class="contents">You raise the question of allocating part of that amount for the benefit of the Community budget. If part of the funds reverted to the Community budget, the amount involved would have to be entered as revenue, in accordance with applicable budget procedure. If these funds were used for actions to combat fraud, as you are proposing, it would be up to the Commission, if it felt it appropriate, to submit proposals on which the European Parliament and the Council – the two branches of the budgetary authority – would have to give a view once that proposal was submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has noted, as you emphasised, that the agreement includes the possibility for Member States to use these funds to finance actions to combat fraud. The Council would like to point out that – since we are dealing with the combat against national fraud using funds which would revert to the national budgets – these funds are the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes the payment of USD 1.25 billion to the European Community and participating Member States over 12 years. The agreement underlines the importance of anti-fraud policies and is regarded as a major success for the Commission and OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the agreement was signed, the Commission has pointed out that all the other Member States should also join it. Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland have recently signed and we hope that the other Member States will soon. We also sincerely hope that the Phillip Morris agreement can serve as a model for a similar agreement with other companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, on behalf of the European Community, and the ten Member States that concluded the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeit Agreement with Philip Morris International, will decide how the funds are to be shared out. Discussions are ongoing and the Commission has repeatedly stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the distribution of the amounts to be allocated. In this regard, we are grateful for Parliament’s support in seeking an adequate share for the Commission allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement is intended to contribute to the fight against smuggling and fraud. It specifies that the monetary payments may serve as a source of additional funding for anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit initiatives. However, it does not include specific obligations for their use.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Bösch report on the fight against fraud, adopted only yesterday, Parliament asks the Commission and the Member States to use the payments accruing from the agreement to fund measures to prevent and combat cigarette smuggling, including anti-counterfeiting activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Funds received by the European Community under the agreement will be entered in the Community budget as non-earmarked funds, in accordance with the rules of the Financial Regulation applicable. The Community legislator and the budgetary authority can, however, decide to adopt a new programme or to widen the scope of an existing programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the Community is entitled to receive a fair share of the funds, reflecting the principles of the Community’s own resources system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been discussing the distribution of the funds with the ten Member States and is confident that a consensus will be reached soon. In December 2004 Commissioner Kallas sent a letter to the ministers of finance and has convened two meetings on the subject. A final agreement has not yet been reached. The question of the share that should be allocated to the Community budget is dependent on the solution that is found to the division of funds between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission actively continues to seek a final consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For understandable reasons, the problem of the illegal circulation of excisable goods is particularly topical. According to calculations by the Member States, in 2003 the EU budget suffered a loss of approximately 200 million euro solely as a result of the illegal trade in cigarettes. Losses to the Member States’ budgets are much greater. Of course, both the Member States’ taxation authorities and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have done a lot to combat the illegal trade in cigarettes. In this connection, the initiative to combine forces in the fight against the illegal trade in cigarettes at European Union level, bringing in the legal cigarette manufacturers, is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation agreement concluded by the European Commission and various EU Member States with Philip Morris International is the first example of this cooperation. The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris International will improve its cigarette distribution system and will provide more detailed information to the Member States’ law enforcement and tax authorities, which is necessary for effectively combating the illegal trade in cigarettes. In addition to this, over a 12-year period Philip Morris International will pay 1.25 billion US dollars into the EU and Member States’ budgets. The European Parliament considers that, ideally, all these resources, or at least the major part of them, should be channelled into combating and preventing the trade in illegal tobacco products.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, as one of the branches of the EU budgetary authority, considers that Parliament should participate in the decision-making on the distribution and use of these resources. We consider that those Member States which have not yet subscribed to this agreement, especially the new Member States, ought to seriously weigh up the possibility of joining. More precise information and extra financial resources will make it possible to combat more effectively the illegal trade in cigarettes and to improve collection of excise duties. Similar agreements could also be concluded with other tobacco companies, and it is to be hoped that this precedent might also encourage the signing of similar agreements with manufacturers of other excisable goods, such as alcohol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commissioner has already made reference to the fact that we have devoted our attention, in a report that this House adopted yesterday, to the subject of cigarette smuggling, which is one of the really big problems that the European Union currently has to contend with. One reason for this is that, when the finance ministers find that the money has run out, the first brilliant idea they come up with is that of increasing the duty on tobacco. This means that illegal cigarettes start coming into the country, and so they still end up with less money than they had before. What is happening is that the Member States – some of them, I have to say, in full knowledge of what they are doing – are rolling out a red carpet to welcome organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has already been made to the agreement initiated by the Commission and OLAF. Tremendous though this is, it does – as the rapporteur noted – have an Achilles heel, in that we did not specify in the agreement what is to be done with the money. In the event of any such agreements being concluded in the future, it is vital – and Parliament demands – that a formula be specified for how the money is to be shared out.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Mr President-in-Office, I too would be very much in favour of the Council discussing what is to be done with this money; it cannot simply be left to each Member State. There is too great a shortage of customs staff. Too many of our customs offices are not yet computerised. Your institution, too, is obliged to give serious thought to this. We expect the money to be allocated to specific purposes when it is paid out. I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Staes, for this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As everybody knows, Hungary is situated in the centre of Europe or, as we say, at the heart of Europe. This means that it lies at the crossroads between north and south, east and west, a crossroads used not only for legitimately traded goods, but also for contraband, including cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Halting and curbing traffic in smuggled goods was an important task for our country even before accession; since accession, however, we have become rather like a bastion defending Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we were very pleased to hear about this exemplary and significant agreement that has been signed with Philip Morris International, thanks to the decisive action on the part of the European Commission and OLAF. We think it is very important that it can be extended to the new Member States too, although the Commission has signed the agreement on behalf of only ten Member States. This means that the advantages it brings in the fight against smuggling and fraud – namely professional, technical and financial support from the EU and OLAF – are now also accessible to us. We were also pleased that, in recognition of our special situation, OLAF has taken up contact with the Hungarian authorities and is developing this mutually beneficial cooperation, that protects both European and Hungarian financial interests simultaneously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been engaged in negotiations with the Member States in an attempt to reach an agreement. Once again I would like to thank the House for its support of our position.</p>
<p class="contents">You have specifically requested that the funds allocated under the agreement should be focused on anti-fraud programmes. You are well aware, as I said in my previous remarks, that these are extra-budgetary funds. The focus of our efforts at this point remains the conclusion of an agreement on how the funds are allocated, not only between the Commission and the Member States, but also among the Member States themselves. The negotiations have been and continue to be difficult, but I am confident that we can resolve the issue in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the programmes to which the funds are to be allocated, the Commission has taken note of the relevant proposal, which will doubtless be considered in due course, once we have reached an agreement on the distribution of the funds. That agreement should then serve to provide the allocation scale for any future similar agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
