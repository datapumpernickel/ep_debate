<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, should it be adopted, will take us into uncharted territory. Why uncharted territory? Because it will give us the opportunity, on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement with the Council, to examine secret military documents and be party to certain information and will therefore enable us to develop a means of extending parliamentary scrutiny to these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been under negotiation for years and I should like in particular to thank the Swedish Presidency, now a distant memory, and the Spanish Presidency for their help, which has made it possible for us to negotiate here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this paper is not perfect. We are entering new territory here and that is why learning is also the order of the day. We must not, however, go too far at the outset, because this is a very sensitive area and at stake are the security interests of the Member States of the European Union and all of our fellow citizens. That is why everyone, both the Council and Parliament, first needs to learn how to work together and to build confidence, so that the necessary information and control processes can then be set in motion on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have also made it clear that either of the two sides can terminate the agreement after two years, so as to draft a new agreement on the basis of the experience acquired, and that this is therefore not a permanent arrangement but just a first step on this sensitive issue of internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been explicitly stated that this agreement in the field of foreign, security and defence policy is without prejudice to future agreements on the transparency of internal documents for internal policies. As has been said, agreements also need to be reached in these areas. I will make it quite clear that in my opinion it is quite conceivable, if not a necessity, that measures will be adopted in internal policy areas, where there are particular sensitivities due to the possible participation of third countries, and that these might go very much further even at the first attempt than is the case in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have achieved something here that certainly bears comparison with the standards in national parliaments and that the security standards, which we ourselves need to develop in this House, will also certainly have their part to play in enabling us to meet the requirements, just as the five Members of the special committee will have to undergo security checks by their respective Member States. As you can see, there are no separate rules here either; the situation is comparable to that of national Members of Parliament. On this basis we can find solutions that will help us to make further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you to support both of these papers on amending the Rules of Procedure and on the agreement itself. I would also ask you to reject one of the amendments, because it concerns the extreme case of criminal offences being committed, by whichever side. This is something that could arise whenever the handling of public funds and public documents is involved. It is regulated elsewhere – not in the Rules of Procedure – and does not need to be regulated here. It is far more appropriate here to proceed in accordance with the traditional principle that action will be taken against anyone committing a criminal offence. Ultimately, of course, we rely on the consciences of those who know of any such criminal offences to speak out, so that action can be taken against their perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this marks a step towards greater transparency and control of our foreign, security and defence policy, and if someone had said five or ten years ago that we would be negotiating the establishment of a committee of this kind in the European Parliament, I would not have thought it possible. This shows how far the European Union as a whole has come since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Cologne Summit on security and defence policy. However, it also shows a commensurate need for parliamentary scrutiny. That is why I would urge the House to support this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is all this about? You can either present and justify all of this as being in the interests of the State, just as Elmar Brok, whom I personally hold in high esteem both here and in other professional contexts, has done, or you can comment a little on the procedure and how this agreement has come about and consider why someone behind me always says, 'EB, EB' when I say, 'EP'.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly need to be a little wary here. I welcome the fact that this agreement will give Parliament a bit more power and that there is also going to be the opportunity to examine certain documents. I do not wish to run the risk of the little man behind me, who always says 'EB, EB', being proved right by people confusing the European Parliament, 'EP', with EB, 'Elmar Brok'.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I saying this, and why, strange as it may seem, are they seen as one and the same thing? Because I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the way in which this has been negotiated is not exactly exemplary, and that the fact is that, in the final analysis, we are faced with a take it or leave it situation. Many Members hardly had the chance to be involved in the negotiating process and above all it is now once again EB who has access to internal documents and, as he himself also said, he is pleased that only Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are involved while the EP, the European Parliament, is left out in the cold.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, indeed we must, live with these objections, because obviously this can be seen as a foot in the door, but as I see it – and I am not the only one – the report does contain some reassurance. It says in the explanatory statement: 'It is ... crucial that the Agreement includes a provision that it will be reviewed after two years at the request of either of the two institutions in the light of the experience acquired in implementing it.'</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that those who are involved now, that is the two EBs and their friends, will not act in such a way that the agreement is unilaterally terminated by the Council or whoever it may be, so that the EP then has an opportunity to have more of a say when the text is redrafted and actually to become what someone previously called a fully-fledged parliament. Each of the individual committees should be able to have their say and fair account should be taken of the very diverse views represented in this House, so that this clash is avoided, and also so that we prove that what was mentioned earlier is true; that we are in agreement here that there can be no democracy without transparency, and that includes within this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Common legislation on the rules for citizens’ access to documents was an important step towards increasing scrutiny of, and confidence in, the European institutions. Transparency is the basis of a democracy and the precondition for citizens’ being able to follow and participate in public decisions. We can therefore increase confidence in, and the legitimacy of, EU cooperation as a whole, two things that we unfortunately know are both in short supply.</p>
<p class="contents">We liberals always push for maximum transparency. We were not entirely satisfied with a number of sections of the legislation, and we believe that there was an exaggerated fear of releasing documents.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Common Security and Foreign Policy, this is an area in the course of development. There is major interest in these issues among citizens and journalists. Naturally, certain documents cannot be made public. Such documents must be kept confidential. We also realise this. Having a small group of members who have access to these highly sensitive documents is, however, one way of ensuring a certain degree of, admittedly limited, parliamentary control in this area, which thus puts pressure on the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, Mr Brok’s proposal is a wholly reasonable agreement. The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party believes, however, that it is necessary to make sure that it does not become too common for documents to be automatically referred to this small committee. Most documents should, of course, be made available to everyone else, the general public, journalists and every other interested party. There should be a few absolutely vital and sensitive documents which are made available to this smaller circle.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased that Mr Brok said that we should have a careful evaluation of this agreement. We could have this in conjunction with a general review of the transparency regulations. In this way, we will hopefully come to realise that transparency as a principle is not dangerous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the ways of doing this would be to give people an opportunity to participate, play their parts and be partners in the whole of the decision-making process taking place in and between the institutions of the EU. The prerequisite of people’s being able to take on that role is that they be able to obtain a feeling for what goes on before the decisions are taken. That is why the principle of access to documents is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">As my fellow MEP, Mrs Malmström, said, we are all of us aware of there being confidential documents that are difficult to make available. The European Parliament has, in my view, embarked upon a slippery slope, however. We find ourselves in a position which we should not have occupied. As the people’s guarantors, as the custodians of democracy and as the institution that should be the democratic guarantor of this project, we have now moved into an area in which we consent to people’s not being given access to documents, with only ourselves or a small group of us having such access. In this way, we are complicit in considering our own interests or, more accurately, those of a small group of MEPs at the expense of the interests of European citizens and their opportunity to be players in the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">As my other fellow MEP from the Group of the Party of European Socialists put it, the whole process involving public access to, and scrutiny of, documents has taken place behind closed doors. That is in itself a problem when we specifically talk about transparency and public access to, and scrutiny of, documents. That is why I do not warm to this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He also said that either party could propose that this agreement should be reviewed after two years. Nevertheless, on behalf of my own group, I should like to draw attention to the weaknesses of the arrangement right from the start. The agreement refers to the fact that it would be, as it were, inspired by best practices in Member States. This must mean that the European Parliament would be guaranteed an absolute right to inspect secret documents on security and defence policy, but I wish to raise the question as to whether this will in fact be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the fact that this agreement allows the Council full powers to decide which documents it will in point of fact actually hand over to this small special committee of the European Parliament. I might imagine that the background to this is discussions held between the Council and NATO. In many respects it seems that the wishes and requirements of NATO have dictated the content of this agreement to a considerable degree. In my opinion, the interests of the European Parliament have not necessarily been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, my fellow Members have quite rightly pointed out that the European Parliament cannot reserve for itself exclusive rights to implement democratic and public monitoring of foreign and defence policy on behalf of our citizens either. Sometimes I feel that when this agreement was negotiated it was thought that these matters were no business of the public, but that Parliament’s small, handpicked team would assume full responsibility for them. That is why I tabled the amendment the rapporteur has already mentioned. I should like to stress that the exceptions in the Rules of Procedure, which Members of the European Parliament must submit to on the basis of this agreement, must be strictly linked to confidential information as mentioned in the regulation on public access, that is to say ‘sensitive’ documents, and no others.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can the right of the Members of the European Parliament to obtain information concerning foreign and security policy, a right that is already guaranteed to them by virtue of Article 21 of the Treaty, be weakened by this agreement. Finally, it is extremely important to stress that, should confidential information contain any reference to some sort of criminal activity, nothing must be allowed to prevent a Member of the European Parliament from contacting the authorities. I would request that Amendment No 2, which is broader in scope that that proposed by the committee, be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the important political forces therefore support the transparency placed on the agenda when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht on 2 June 1992. We have seen progress in a number of areas, but we also have a number of things to look forward to. The Commission now publishes its agendas and the minutes of the meetings at which decisions are taken. It is important to know who said what and how they voted. The Commissioners must be accountable to the public. The Council has issued minutes relating to the working party’s discussions on transparency. We must have similar access to other working parties’ working documents and minutes, and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently debating a proposal for a compromise on Parliament’s access to confidential information, but the new rules would limit that access to which all MEPs are entitled under the Treaty. I believe we could make more progress by going to the Court of Justice, as has been done with great success in connection with proper agreements. I shall not therefore vote in favour of the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">If truth be told, the European Parliament has never negotiated anything in the way of progress. There have been individual MEPs who have exerted pressure, together with the Ombudsman and active citizens who have won one legal case after another. It is before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that we have achieved most progress, not in negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. That is the sad fact. The European Parliament is always ready to make demands, but it becomes silent whenever, as now, there is the possibility of a framework agreement’s being entered into or a regulation on transparency’s being negotiated, entailing the danger of documents at present publicly available in Denmark and Sweden being regarded as secret as soon as they are forwarded to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor am I happy with the new agreement, and I would call upon the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to go to the Court of Justice in connection with those documents we cannot obtain, such as the screening reports on the candidate countries’ adjustments to EU legislation. The screening reports are very good examples of documents it should be possible for everyone here in the Chamber and in the candidate countries’ parliaments to read. I doubt if we should be able to obtain them under the new rules. I cannot imagine the Court of Justice preventing us from obtaining documents that are a clear part of the legislative process. I believe we can obtain more progress by putting up a fight than by entering now into a poor compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although there are gaps in the agreement, as the rapporteur himself points out when he says that Parliament has had to make concessions to the Council, it is, at least, a step towards greater democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as a member of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I find it absolutely inconceivable that Parliament should be blatantly denied access to documents in the field of justice and home affairs, the very area in which rules have a direct impact on the citizens’ rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14 and 15 October discussed the framework decision on drugs, but the most recent document available on the register dates back to June. A number of documents have been circulated since then but the European Parliament has not seen any of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that the citizens are being prevented from knowing what compromise the Danish Presidency has proposed? Maybe it is fear that people will find out that the ministers do not respect the mandates of their governments, parliaments and citizens behind the closed doors of the Council and that they are therefore doing at European level what they lack the courage to do at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the Danish Minister, Mrs Lene Espersen, lacked the courage to describe the contents of this compromise to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights today. One last example: at least 20 of the 39 documents discussed at the meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs of 14 and 15 October were not published on the register.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that there must be an end to this way of treating the European Parliament and the citizens who elected it, who continue to be disgracefully humiliated by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Parliament has no competence in that area, either legislative or budgetary. Furthermore, it has to be said that, within the context of the Treaties, the function of this Parliament is to scrutinise the Commission. Its responsibility does not extend to the scrutiny or review of Council activities. Scrutiny of Council members remains the responsibility of individual national parliaments. It is to them that their individual ministers are responsible. Only those parliaments can hold ministers to account.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, it seems to be a measure of the self-importance of the Members of this Parliament that they are seeking information that is not in the public domain. I would say that it is none of their business. Parliament should not be asking for it, and the Council should not give it.</p>
<p class="contents">This also has wider implications. The information is not to be given to all Members but to a select and privileged cartel within this Parliament. Furthermore, those who receive that information are to be sworn to secrecy and can be disciplined for breaches of confidence. There cannot be a better way of muzzling representatives of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The central point is that, if the primary role of Parliament is scrutinising the Commission, then that is exactly what it should be doing. Time allocated for debates on these matters is already ridiculously short, and scrutiny is therefore minimal. It would be far better if the House concentrated on its statutory duties, rather than poking its nose into areas which are none of its business.</p>
<p class="contents">In pursuit of more information, therefore, it would be much better if it devoted its energies to pressing for more transparency and openness from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement can also be adopted or rejected regardless of them, but it cannot yet enter into force, as the security rules have not yet been adopted. The Interinstitutional Agreement can therefore be adopted tomorrow in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me to address a brief comment to the Members. We are dealing here solely with foreign, security and defence policy, none of which form part of the legislation. That, Mr Bonde, is why this committee does not deal with any papers that have to do with legislation, in which area Mr Turco is talking about justice and internal affairs. I have said quite clearly that the Agreement recommends that a separate agreement be negotiated for this area, and I believe that this should go much further in taking Parliament's rights into account. Mrs Hautala is right to say that, if this does not succeed, one of the options provided is that of an appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, by the way, like to tell Mrs Hautala and others that it is only when we know the documents that we can say whether their classifications are justified. If we see that access is not being given to papers that Parliament as a whole is actually meant to be able to see, we can say that they have been wrongly classified, and in this way bring about a change in practice at Council level. If, though, we know nothing about the documents, we can have no criticism to make on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, we have to say that getting access to such documents represents a new start for the Council and the Commission as well. Without such a settlement, we will have difficulty in carrying on any sort of European foreign and security policy. In this instance, therefore, all the institutions have a shared interest in finding a point from which they can all start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
