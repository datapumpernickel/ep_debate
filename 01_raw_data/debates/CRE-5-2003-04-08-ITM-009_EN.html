<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kirkhope (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, although what I have to say is not quite as exciting as what we have just discussed – at first sight, that is – I must say as a former UK immigration minister, that one of the most difficult processes in the immigration system arises when you have to remove a person who has gone through all the legal processes and no longer has a legal right to remain, or has not provided a legal reason to remain in a Member State and has to be returned to the place from whence they came.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of course a difficult decision for everybody involved in the handling of the matter: it is difficult for the officials, it is difficult for the Ministers themselves; but it has to be done in a way which is both humane and also effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this, where the travelling arrangements require assistance to be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other European countries on the way back to where they have to go. Because of a lack of coordination or cooperation, it has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned; it has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out in a successful manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore this German initiative, one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur, is aimed at trying to bring this matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are really looking for here is that the persons concerned should be afforded the necessary support, if required, in terms of sustenance, in terms of medical assistance, should that be necessary when they transit through airports on their way to their destination. But in particular, we need also to make sure that the airlines carrying them are aware of what they are carrying and the situation during the procedures. That has not always been the case in the past, and this report should assist in achieving that end. Similarly it is important that the documents sent with the persons concerned are treated in a proper manner during the process of transit. That is not by any means the case at the present time. This is something we also wish to see as a result of this work.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else's responsibility to see that these matters occur in the proper way. Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this not only in Britain, but indeed in most of the EU Member States. I know that this is a measure that will be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that at last we are beginning to realise that we have to get together in order to achieve ends such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not in any way affect the individual Member States' procedures, nor is it a measure which tries to be ambitious and look again at the whole issue of asylum procedures as such, or indeed asylum criteria. That would indeed be ambitious, and it is not something that I aim to pursue. It is purely a simple and very practical measure which will bring about the result which has to occur from time to time once the proper legal processes have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because it is a clear demonstration that regardless of our political views on Europe and its future role, there are many areas like this where we can work together in a way which makes a practical difference to many people – both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations. For that reason, apart from any other, I am pleased with this report and I hope that it is supported in the House tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Return Action Programme of the Council adopted on 28 November 2002, which is based on our communication, also calls for a comprehensive Community return policy, which should be gradually developed, starting with some practical steps for operational cooperation as the matter in hand. In that framework, reference was also made to the German initiative for a Council directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purpose of return by air, which I support, as you do. I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report. Indeed, a common framework should be set for questions relating to transit during the return process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has presented a proposal on burden-sharing of costs during the return operations. But often it is necessary to use airports of other Member States, due to a lack of direct connections to the country of return. In such cases it is important that we establish a clear legal framework for the transit procedures, especially as far as the use and competences of escorts in transit is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless a fully-fledged common return policy must additionally strive for medium-term legislative measures which will not only smoothen cooperation among Member States, such as the binding mutual recognition of return decisions, but will also set certain common minimum standards on expulsion, detention and removal, to guarantee that all Member States – not only the 15 but all 25 – abide by and respect human and fundamental rights standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently the Commission envisages presenting a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for return procedures and mutual recognition of return decisions by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the only elected European Union institution is justifying these expulsions and helping to organise them shows that it is worth no more from a human or social point of view than the national institutions, that is not very much.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of inhumanity comes hypocrisy, because no one can ignore the fact that industry, construction and industrial agriculture rely to a large extent on immigration, whether it be legal, illegal or seasonal. Turning so-called illegal immigrants into fair game for the police means above all handing them over with their hands and feet tied to their employers: this reduces some workers to semi-slaves, it pushes down everyone's wages and it is part of the war being waged on the poor by all the governments of Europe. I therefore protest against these expulsions and call for all those without papers to be given a proper legal status and the same civil and political rights as all workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal is one of numerous initiatives seeking to combat unorthodox immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union has to have a common immigration and asylum policy and has to provide itself with the means to manage migratory flows, this policy should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are universally recognised and acknowledged by the Member States. This is why we cannot support an approach which seeks to make the deportation of third-country nationals who do not have the right papers a populist tool at the service of a repressive policy on the reality of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many expulsions by air have ended in the death of human beings because of the way in which they have been treated. Everyone remembers Semira Adamou, who suffocated in a plane in Belgium while being deported. Last month, again, in France, two other immigrants who did not have the necessary papers died at the hands of the same violence. Recently, on 3 March, France and Germany expelled a group of 54 Senegalese and Ivorians who had not been admitted to these countries, had had their asylum applications dismissed and had been kept in a waiting zone. This sounds to me very much like forced and – at the very least – mass repatriation. Were Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that was ratified at the Nice Summit, respected? Furthermore, in the Ivorians' case they were sent back to a country where there is currently unrest and civil war. Were the procedures for applying for asylum that are guaranteed by the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees also respected? Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the principle of non-refoulement, that is recognised in asylum law, was fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The security-based approach that is being proposed to us today is entirely in keeping with the Union's practices, which, we have to admit, have not enabled the problem of illegal immigration to be resolved. We urgently need to recognise that the myth of zero immigration and its corollary, the all-repressive approach, are a failure. So far the Member States' repressive immigration policies have not caused a decline in illegal immigration. Quite the opposite: they have reinforced it by breeding more immigrants without the proper papers and they have sent hundreds of thousands of people underground, people who are now in the grip of networks of exploitative criminals, traffickers in human beings and advocates of modern slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">This failure demands a thorough revision of the immigration and asylum policy. This is a major and complex issue with a great deal at stake in the long term and our democracies have an important responsibility to assume for it. In rejecting a Community policy so as to meet the national demands of the Member States, in putting the rights of migrants and their families at risk, thus handing them over to the violence of deportation, and in refusing to recognise the wealth that these citizens, whether legal or not, bring to the project of European integration, this proposal is based on a philosophy that runs counter to our conviction that Europe should be a place of openness and solidarity, and that is why the Group of the Greens rejects it. We call on the Council to establish a genuine Community asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms. We recommend a European campaign to legalise the situation of all those who do not have papers, who have ties in the host country and who reside there on a long-term basis. We recommend putting an end to the injustice of people being punished twice and sometimes even three times because of the readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to remedy the contradictory situation of people who can neither be deported nor given legal papers, by finally recognising the right to live in a family. After the minimalist proposal for a directive on family reunification that we examined just now in this House, we can only imagine the kind of discrimination that the European Union intends to reserve for the most marginalised and weak in the future. We are against these practices and assure you that we will remain vigilant and active in our efforts to ensure that all those who reside in Europe can be full citizens and enjoy equal rights. Whatever their nationality or their administrative situation, these people should be treated with the dignity that all human beings deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
