I see a good number of familiar faces. I wish to pay tribute to my shadow rapporteur, Mr Harbour, who again is attending a late-night sitting with me. We probably spend more nights together than we do with our respective wives.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to pay tribute to a number of people who have worked on this report, not just within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market but also within the Commission and the Council. It was not a difficult conciliation but it was successful and I was very pleased at the outcome. I should also like to give the thanks of probably about a third of the population of the European Union to Parliament, for I am anticipating that the vote tomorrow will go the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">There are something like 35 million registered disabled people within the European Union; we have 120 million elderly people. The two groups are obviously not mutually exclusive, but they make up about a third of the population of the European Union. The outcome of tomorrow's vote will very largely decide what their quality of life in the future will be. For years now people with disabilities have not been able to get around the towns and cities of the European Union as they should; they have been trapped for too long in their own houses. If this directive is adopted tomorrow, it will open up that door. It will be one small step towards freeing a lot of people who, as I said earlier, have been trapped. I would like to convey their thanks to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that some of my colleagues on the right of this House have had difficulties with this directive, mainly because of its technical nature. I fully understand and appreciate that. However, I would ask them at this late stage to consider what we are doing, because if this directive is adopted tomorrow, it is something that everybody in Parliament could be proud of, because we would be improving the lives of the citizens of the European Union. For once we would be making a difference. Too often we stand up in this Chamber and talk about various great plans, schemes and motions, etc. and they do not impact on people's lives. Here is a small thing that does impact on the lives of the European citizen and it is something we should all be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand my colleagues on the right will be abstaining tomorrow. That is unfortunate but it is, at least, an improvement on voting against in the second reading. I would ask them, however, to look at this again and cast their votes in favour, because all along I have tried to leave out the technicalities and have concentrated purely on the policy and philosophy of getting people with disabilities mobile again. That is an aim and objective I think we would all agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I have really not much more to say, because this has been discussed at length. The Commissioner is well aware of the contents of the report and probably could recite them as well as I could.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank very much all those who have helped draft this report and who tomorrow will help to adopt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to pay tribute to him for his persistence in working through this, and particularly for the masterly way in which he handled the conciliation process. This is the first time I have been involved in a trialogue, so I have been able to study the process at work. Indeed, as he says, we have reached a very satisfactory outcome. I fully supported the final compromise and, indeed, the benefits that it will deliver. It is important that we finally, after five long years, bring this to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">In a moment I shall refer to some of the issues involved. However, it is important to add that, in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about, we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed. The buses are only part of it. That is something that we have not been able to tackle but that other committees will wish to look at.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the principles? He quite rightly said – I tipped him off beforehand – that we will be abstaining on this. It will go through tomorrow. We certainly do not wish to obstruct it or vote against the conciliation procedure, but we feel, on this side of the House, that the principles that led us to vote against this last time – and my colleague, Mr Rübig, who will speak later, is a veteran of the previous process – are entirely consistent. So we will not be obstructing it. It will go on its way with our qualified support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Miller has played the role of the man riding the last dinosaur, if I may put it that way. Commissioner Liikanen told us at second reading in the debate that he does not envisage bringing a regulation of this complexity before Parliament again. That is absolutely the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take the opportunity to say to the House tonight that I, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, have made a proposal to other committees and to the Commission on ways in which Parliament can exercise its political role in scrutinising and putting forward ideas for motor vehicle regulation. We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation, specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and, indeed, covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about.</p>
<p class="contents">That will allow this Parliament, through all its various committees, to take a serious look at the political content of regulation and not ever again become immersed for five years in this sort of complex, technical regulation – a process that we finally sign off this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament and the Council seriously disagreed on this point. The European Parliament’s insistence on provisions to facilitate access for persons of reduced mobility, especially wheelchair users, was vindicated, as was the rapporteur, Mr Miller. The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with the position taken by the European Parliament, proves yet again how important issues such as the quality of life can only be promoted through courageous policies which are free from technocrats' reservations and financial considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive introduces a broader definition of the term ‘persons of reduced mobility’, stipulating that it includes all people who experience some difficulty when using public transport, especially the elderly and the disabled. Reduced mobility does not necessary depend on some form of medical complaint. This is an important innovation which could be used as the starting point for similar adjustments to give substance to policy on the quality of life. To be specific, disability may take different forms, including not just physical mobility but also intellectual and sensory impairment. Therefore, it also includes people who merely have limb impairments, are of small stature, pregnant women etc. It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface. It is also worth pointing out that it does not limit itself to vehicle specifications; in order to ensure passengers can board safely, it also makes provision for easier access through local infrastructure planning. This should guarantee safe, pavement-level boarding by all persons of reduced mobility. I would like to believe that the spirit of agreement achieved here will prevail over other similar endeavours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved only a small partial success with this directive on the EC procedure for approving vehicle types because, of course, national procedures for type approval still apply concurrently with, and in addition to, the directive which is now being laid down. What we want matters here, and I would like to express my thanks to Mr Miller for working so hard to ensure that what we want prevails.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, not true of national procedures for type approval, which prevail at present and will continue to prevail in future. The success is a very modest one, and we will therefore be abstaining tomorrow, because it does not go far enough for us, because we would actually have liked a general regulation for all buses.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that the Commission's proposal was a very, very good one in terms of content and from the points of view of engineering and technology, but must be rejected absolutely on the grounds of logic. At first reading, we had 160 pages of detailed Commission proposals on the table, Members worked out another 110 amendments to them, and I think this House and, at the end of the day, Europe as a whole, is overburdened with this sort of detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of affairs we will be deciding on tomorrow is such that we have now even fixed the curvature of the rear panel of a bus at a normative maximum of 150 mm. Even compared with the European standard cucumber, that is a sensational success! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
