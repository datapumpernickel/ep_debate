It is very difficult for us to find a line here which expresses this deep concern about the situation in North Korea, yet does not escalate the conflict. We do not want to create a similar situation to Iraq, but we do want to exert massive pressure on the North Korean government to focus on the needs of its people instead.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, this is not the first time we have turned our attention to this issue. What is especially disappointing is that we have made numerous overtures to North Korea in a bid to work towards exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy, so that the country's few resources can genuinely flow into development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we want to make it clear yet again that we want to work for dialogue, and that we urge North Korea also to engage in dialogue with us. We are pleased that the Americans too are prepared, in this instance at least, to engage in dialogue towards a peaceful solution and that talks are currently taking place. We call on the Commission to continue the provision of humanitarian aid, despite these unpleasant and unacceptable political conditions, and to help the country's starving population. With this in mind, Madam President, I think we are able to support the relevant resolution and express the hope that the United States and Europe will opt in this instance for a common approach in order to persuade North Korea to help its own people instead of posing a threat to the global community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tannock (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, as North Korean dictator, Kim Jong–Il sips his specially imported French brandy and savours his freshly cooked pizzas cooked by two Italian chefs, as he mulls over what he will say to the UN envoy, many thousands of his oppressed subjects, including babies, are literally starving to death as his disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees.</p>
<p class="contents">Even worse is that many of his people are rotting as political prisoners in re–education camps where they are being tortured and beaten. The country outrageously styles itself 'the Democratic People's Republic of Korea', and yet the people have never been consulted, as Mr Kim inherited his mandate from his late dictator father.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only has that country, which is a brutal, secretive, communist dictatorship, repeatedly violated international agreements such as the 1994 one to end its bomb–making uranium enrichment programme, it has also in the past violated every standard of civilised behaviour, from kidnapping Japanese civilians – which the government justified, almost unbelievably, on the grounds of needing language instructors for its spies – to engaging in political assassinations such as blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years ago. It was also responsible for blowing up a South Korean airliner.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently – and this is the reason for my motion for resolution – it has starved many thousands of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies and the fact that it has chosen to maintain one million men under arms with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military, irrespective of the deprivation suffered by its civilian population. It remains a failing and rogue state and a very dangerous one at that. It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it technically remains at war.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the EU must tread carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid to its long–suffering people. Nevertheless, aid donors must still insist on verification procedures to ensure that the food gets through to those it is intended for and is not given to the army or, worse still, resold to raise cash for more armaments or luxuries for its political and military elite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the ‘Great Leader’ lives in the lap of luxury he is literally allowing his own people to die. More than two million people are said to have starved to death over the past few years and more than 13 million are suffering from malnutrition. Communist misrule has ensured that the malnourished people are left out in the cold and are deprived of proper medical care. In this workers’ paradise, about 200 000 people are kept imprisoned in re–education camps for political reasons. What is more, China is systematically returning North Korean political refugees, knowing full well that inhumane punishment awaits the returnees.</p>
<p class="contents">An appropriate response from the world community is seriously hindered by the nuclear game with which Kim Jong-Il is challenging the world. It is not clear whether it is possible to talk to Kim in a reasonable way. America’s attitude towards North Korea is a model of caution compared with her stance towards Iraq. As far as this nuclear threat is concerned, the European Union must fall in line with the United States – insofar as she does have a line. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of an unpredictable dictator are a permanent threat to world peace, and this cannot therefore be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also focus on humanitarian aid in order to prevent human suffering from taking on even greater proportions. It is a good thing that the Commission is intending to earmark another EUR 9.5 million for women and children over and above the 50 million already spent. The question is whether this is enough. I assume the Commission is willing to do more should it be necessary. I would appreciate confirmation of this from the Commission. North Korea has gone from bad to worse as a result of her self–imposed isolation. We must look for ways of breaking through this and putting an end to the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In bitter winter conditions, the combination of few or no energy sources and lack of food is crippling. So the Verts/ALE Group welcomes the Commission's decision to provide EUR 9.5 million in food aid to North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a need to reconsider fundamentally our approach to ensuring energy supplies. The Korean Energy Development Organisation, KEDO, was unsuited to meeting the country's needs and infrastructure, and this situation cannot be allowed to continue. We condemned it and the European Union's approach to the energy crisis needs to be completely overhauled. I was pleased to hear Commissioner Patten declare that the European Union will have to develop an alternative energy programme for North Korea. We welcome the Commission's position on this, and we look forward to the development of a suitable programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look again at our policy of cooperation with North Korea in terms of a poverty alleviation programme to offset the effects of introducing a market economy, democratic reforms and respect for human rights, and official diplomatic recognition for North Korea by other states as well as the European Union. This would open up opportunities for North Korea to access funds from the IMF, the Asian Development Bank and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The key, as Mr Swoboda said earlier in this debate, is to continue to talk, to continue with the negotiations and, above all, to work for a peaceful solution to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the 38th parallel there hangs an ‘iron curtain’ that is more hermetically sealed than the Berlin Wall ever was. Behind it, after the ‘Great Leader’ Kim Il-Sung, the ‘Dear Leader’ Kim Jong-Il is now playing the depressing game of the ‘Great Lie’. In what is virtually dynastic succession, father and son have been sacrificing the people of North Korea to their megalomaniac self-glorification and personal dictatorship for more than half a century. Pyongyang has long tried to deny this awful reality. The testimony of those North Koreans who have managed to escape has been rejected as lies. Satellite pictures provide incontrovertible evidence, however: there really are slave camps for political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Our eyes have been opened very late to the acute danger that the North Korean regime poses – to the international community as well. The immediate cause of this was Pyongyang’s recent unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear non–proliferation treaty. The possible development of North Korean nuclear weapons and the clandestine sale of these weapons, including missile systems, now requires a quick response from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make a case for a regional diplomatic approach to the North Korean crisis. Incidentally, the international community should emphatically reject Pyongyang’s <span class="italic">diktat</span> – a non–aggression pact with the USA enforced by the threat of nuclear weapons – out of compassion for the citizens of North Korea behind Kim’s ‘iron curtain’ who have to spend their lives in conditions that are almost impossible to imagine, and also for the sake of their safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After visiting that country three times, however, I believe the most aberrant, most monstrous kind of breach of human rights is the fact that, if today North Korea held free, democratic elections as we do, the current leader, Kim Jong–Il, would win them. This shows, first, the terrible ability of the North Korean leadership to keep their country isolated from any external interference – and in today’s globalised world that is not easy – and, secondly, the degree of capitulation and humiliation to which the population has been reduced. The violations and violence not only affect their bodies, through hunger and the concentration camps, but also their minds, for they have been brainwashed and left unable to think, as in the Soviet gulags; the North Koreans have been reduced to sheep that follow their leader blindly.</p>
<p class="contents">This barbarous and, at the same time, grotesque regime must be contained. I am one of those that believe that the United States’ policy is right, especially in the last few days: they have moderated their demands, they have avoided a crisis with South Korea and they have made overtures to China, a key country for resolving the crisis in the area. The contribution that Europe can make, that we can make, is only minor on the political front, I am sorry to say. We can and must do more on a humanitarian level: we must send aid, certainly, but we must also make sure (as has been said so many times) that it gets into the right hands, the hands of those that need it. Despite all the declarations and personal statements given on this, I am not at all certain that there is any guarantee of this today. I would very much like there to be, and I would very much like the Commission to be able to give us this assurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of you have pointed out the contradictions that exist in North Korea. On the one hand, it is a country with an enormous army, it has a secret uranium enrichment programme, it is the first country to have withdrawn from the Non–Proliferation Treaty and is threatening its neighbours, and on the other hand, it is suffering from serious internal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of the Cold War took away the country’s cheap sources of oil and raw materials, and it cannot produce enough to satisfy its needs. There is a shortage of medicines, there is not enough power, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the European Union respond to such a contradictory situation? It is clear that we cannot continue to do things as they have been done so far. That is why, last November, the members of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation decided to suspend the delivery of heavy fuels to North Korea. At the same time, I think that it is essential, as some of you have suggested, to pursue our efforts, to pursue the dialogue in order to make them see reason. We are currently discussing with the Member States of the Union the best way of achieving this objective, and we are also pleased to see that the United States are considering some of these problems with a view to holding a dialogue with North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, while we are concerned about what is happening in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, we cannot, and do not want to punish the weakest and most disadvantaged sectors of the population of Korea, especially for the errors of their Government. Some of you have talked about grotesque governments that do not respond to the reality of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, following the discussions held in November in the Council, the Ministers agreed that we need to maintain our humanitarian assistance, including food aid. You have proposed that we should maintain the aid, but you also warn that we should be much more careful in monitoring it. The Council fully shares this view. Adequate supervision of the supply of humanitarian aid is therefore a high priority, and we are considering that issue in particular, both in bilateral contacts with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and in contacts with the World Food Programme, which distributes our aid in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the data we are currently using could be useful to Parliament. As you are aware, ECHO is the main foreign donor of humanitarian aid to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, excluding food aid, and since 1995 it has supplied more than EUR 62 million in humanitarian aid. The aid is granted impartially. It is supplied to the most needy through European Union NGOs, the Red Cross and United Nations Organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, EUR 11.5 million were allocated to the restoration and protection of water supplies, wells, sanitation structures, distribution of water containers, chlorine tablets, hygiene materials, medication, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of food aid, we are currently a relatively minor donor. In 2002, as some of you have pointed out, we supplied 23 000 tonnes of wheat worth EUR 5 million to the World Food Programme for North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week we approved a package of emergency food aid amounting to EUR 9.5 million. It was 39 000 tonnes of cereals especially for children, in response to the appeal made in November by the World Food Programme for North Korea. It was granted by ECHO solely on the condition that – and we are once again concerned about the problem of monitoring – the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea accepted the requests of the World Food Programme; this would mean better supervision and checks on the ground. With regard to this most recent request, the Commission, Italy, Norway and Switzerland are the only countries that have committed to progressing down this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
