A rapporteur without such sound qualitative input is only a small cog in a big machine. We have been able to establish a sound dialogue, which is what is important at the end of the day. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, especially Commissioner Liikanen, for the sound cooperation and meaningful debates which we held, but more than anything, I am grateful to him for his willingness to take into account the debate and vote on this report in the publication of the new directives. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, five years ago, it was totally inconceivable that today, we would be talking about competition in the field of services but also, above all, competition in the field of infrastructure within Europe. This is completely new. If we close our eyes and think ahead about what is going to happen in the next five years, then this is an enormous development. This also means – and that is my second point – that you have to think very clearly about what to legislate for at the moment within the European Union in order to promote this convergence process which is moving at the speed of light. I think that the point of departure should be that we decide, if at all possible, in favour of full competition and that, based on full competition, we identify what we still need now in terms of sector-specific regulation. There will, of course, always be sector-specific regulation, but eventually, we need to move in the direction of competition as a guiding principle. I therefore think that the Commission was right – and my report has hopefully contributed to this – in opting in favour of fine-tuning the – to my mind – more rigid model which was used by the Commission in the first instance, the so-called ‘significant market power and dominant position’. I honestly hope that the Commission will move further in the direction we have proposed. The markets are moving extremely fast. The developments transcend national borders. We are witnessing all kinds of vertical and horizontal integrations. We can see inter-sectoral movement, which means that, each time, we need to examine one particular sector within the market. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my third point is that you also need to consider the supervisory structures which are in place. It will, of course, not be the case that in five years’ time, we will still have 15 telecom/ICT markets in Europe. As far as this is concerned, we will need to grow towards one European internal market. This also means that I can see two developments in this field, which cause me some concern. One is that national supervisory bodies are still working in isolation and my report offers an enormous boost to these bodies to link up, merge or integrate with the general national competition authorities and, where necessary, with media supervisory bodies. We also need to ask ourselves how long we need to continue the specific sector supervision. It is, of course, excellent to have a High Level Group, but the main drawback of having such a group is that, because of its huge significance, it is extremely difficult to sideline. I therefore hope in this respect that by means of sunset and horizon clauses, we will be able to do something about limiting the time during which these groups are active. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is of utmost importance to the citizen for prices to become much more transparent and the cost of roaming to drop, and for the citizen to gain an insight into how this mechanism works. The citizen would also very much welcome number portability, as would the mobile sector, so as to empower the consumer, and I think we should fight for this. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, auctions should also come under close scrutiny. Currently, auction prices far outstrip the actual administrative costs, and I am therefore very curious as to whether the Commissioner would like to answer my urgent written questions at this stage, namely to what extent the forthcoming auctions in the United Kingdom and other Member States comply with Article 11 of a Licensing Directive which explicitly states that only administrative costs should be covered. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, another important point is 112, caller location. If something happens to me, it should be possible to trace me immediately. This is why this caller location facility is so vital. But it is also important to combat the abuse of 112. In addition, it is also of great importance, in my view, certainly in the case of third-generation mobiles, to offer the caller location facility. This does mean, however, that the user should grant permission to set this up. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a serious problem is the democratic hole within the entire ICT sector. Once we have completed 5 or 6 directives in the foreseeable future, we as European Parliament will have outlived our mandate in this field. At the same time, the Commission will carry on with the CoCom (Communications Committee), the Council delegation. In my report, I expressly call for an EP working party which is authorised by Parliament to negotiate with the Commission on the same terms as the CoCom. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, surely it should not be the case that Parliament could be sidelined in this day and age. I therefore make an urgent appeal to Parliament, but also to the Commission, to plug this democratic hole which currently exists in the way I have just described. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have now reached the stage where at the end of this month, the European Commission will produce the directives. I have thanked the Commissioner. I also hope that the Commissioner is able and willing to take into account the outcome of this debate in the forthcoming directives, because that is what it is all about at the end of the day. That is democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Approximately two years ago, the national telecommunications markets were successfully liberalised by Community directives and the transposition thereof. A new legal framework will be framed this summer at European level, as Mr van Velzen has already mentioned. It is intended to strengthen competition, particularly at local level, and will take account of our experiences with the existing legal situation. Furthermore, a new legal framework tailored to new dynamic and unpredictable markets with considerably more players than there are today must be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Permit me briefly to address four key points that are also to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on whose behalf I am able to speak today. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, particular attention must be given to the transposition of existing directives, so that what are still major disparities in the liberalisation of the national markets do not become entrenched, thereby impeding implementation of the new regulatory framework. Of course, this is where the Commission comes in, as Guardian of the Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the possibility of deregulation, or rather the gradual transition from sector-specific rules to general competition law must be enshrined in the directives as of now. However, that too has already been catered for by Commissioner Liikanen and his team.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new legal framework must take account of the convergence of the media. However, this should not lead to the highly competitive mobile radio communications market, which has grown freely, being subject to the same rules as apply to the fixed network. In any case, the operators are currently being hit hard by the auctioning of UMTS frequencies. According to the experts, it will take them several years just to raise the funds needed for auction. This alone is very detrimental for Europe’s future industry, the mobile radio communications sector. We must not add to the problem by imposing ex-ante access and interconnection obligations on investors in transmission infrastructure and introducing the instrument of operator selection developed for the fixed network.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, ultimately, the unbundling of subscriber access should be laid down in a binding manner. The competitors of the former monopolists should be afforded direct access to the final customer via the telecommunications cable in all Member States, so that they too are able to offer broad band services. This kind of competition will increase the number of Internet connections with a high data transmission rate and reduce the cost of Internet connections. So as not to disadvantage those Member States that have already complied with this requirement, it should be left to the Member States themselves to decide which aspects of unbundling subscriber access they wish to lay down in a binding manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done an enormous amount of work on the amendments to reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years in Europe. Regional differences are still too great, however, for us to be able to speak of a free telecommunications market. Every Eurocitizen must be afforded the opportunity to use all communications services at a fair price. For example, factors that restrict competition in mobile communications, such as the overpricing of the ‘roaming’ facility and the lack of the preselection and call transfer facility, must be rectified through action at Community level. The Commission must give assurances that these obstacles to competition are removed as promptly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, simply concentrate on wireless communications. The situation regarding competition in the fixed networks must also be radically improved. The monopoly status the telephone companies enjoy must be destroyed right down to the last copper wire. Otherwise, people living in remote areas, in particular, will be at a disadvantage. I hope the Commission gives a clear response to this question: how will local loops be opened up to competition, or, in other words, how can we most effectively break up the monopolies in the fixed networks? </p>
<p class="contents">The question of the distribution of the UMTS frequencies is a matter that should not be regulated at Community level. Arguments could be put forward in favour of both spectrum auctions and so-called beauty contests. The fact is that the astronomical prices that result from spectrum auctions always end up with consumers having to foot the bill. Beauty contests are, in many respects, more consumer-oriented, and more of an alternative that supports the freeing up of the market. Unlike spectrum auctions, beauty contests do not involve operators having to pay a sum of money that is in the nature of a PAYE tax. I would like to ask the Commissioner, in connection with this issue, whether the Commission considers that spectrum auctions promote competition. I hope that I will receive unambiguous answers to these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Read (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, is to be congratulated on having produced a balanced and well-founded report and a balanced and well-founded speech in support of it. I can applaud, as always, his comprehension of the need to regulate but with carefully argued parameters. It is right to remind ourselves that when we talk about regulation, it is not something of which we have either more or less; within the European Union we plan to regulate for a purpose, for a goal, over a certain period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good, too, that Mr van Velzen's report has a clear appreciation of what the convergence of various technologies means. He and many other contributors to this debate have reflected on how both Parliament and the Commission have been able to look at what has happened in the past and try and guess – educated guesses – about what may happen in the future. Where we have not guessed correctly, we have been able to put things right. The speed of change, not only in terms of technology, but also in global competition in this field, has meant that the margin of error is much less. This is why this report is so important. It lays the groundwork for the future development of the Commission's plans and Parliament's response for this industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group will not be able to support all of the amendments and the details of qualified criticisms of the "auctions versus beauty contest" proposals. We had hoped to be able to have split votes on that. I regret that we cannot; nor can I support the amendment that calls for mobile telephones and the mobiles market to be excluded. We ought to take great care not to introduce rules that limit growth in this startlingly versatile market. Nor do we want to enter into a situation where mobiles are excluded and other forms of telecommunications are included.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw attention to Amendments Nos 3 and 4. Amendment No 3 calls for a clearer and unambiguous formulation of the political aims and principles underlying the further development of the European telecommunications market, which is absolutely essential. Amendment No 4 highlights the urgent need to devote special attention to implementing the existing directives so that major differences in the liberalisation of national markets do not become entrenched and thereby hamper the implementation of new rules. We still have 15 partially liberalised and still largely segmented markets. What we have here is the basis for opening up the European Union market in a genuine sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend Mr van Velzen's report to you and congratulate him again on it; and I congratulate the Commission on the speed, diligence and thoughtfulness with which it has approached the redrafting and relaunching of European Union legislation in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I want to point out that we support the original report. We cannot, however, support all the amendments because they do not show the increased clarity which might well be demanded when, within a few weeks, we shall have the concrete draft directives on the table. I do not think it is necessary for us to agree upon woolly compromises a few weeks before we have the directives in front of us. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we can discuss the telecommunications area at a sociable hour and not, as we usually do, late in the evening with just a few telecommunications freaks taking part. There is therefore also good reason for noting that, since we last met, important solutions for Europe have been produced at the <span class="italic">World Radio Conference</span> in Istanbul.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we in the European Parliament should support the preparatory work which has been done in the CEPT, or <span class="italic">European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations</span>, and that we should not criticise this work for I believe that it was one of the reasons why Europe was successful to the point that our models were adopted and that we obtained supplementary limits for the third generation telephones, as well as uniform frequencies throughout the world. </p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the forthcoming principles, I think it is extremely important that, then too, we try to strike a balance regarding technology-neutral solutions. I believe, for example, that, even today, the auctions we are talking about are not technology-neutral because they discriminate against mobile telephony in relation to the existing, fixed networks. That is not being technology-neutral. </p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled amendments to cancel the demands to merge the national regulatory and competition authorities. We do not think that this would be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. There is no reason for requiring a merger in this context. What is more, we have a very great variety of solutions in different Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate him on having done so. But it is pointless to make liberalisation an end in itself. Hence political objectives must be fulfilled. Liberalisation should benefit subscribers and competition. </p>
<p class="contents">There are a few points that we definitely still need to address. There has certainly been a drop in prices, however, this has happened in the business sector and there is little or no evidence of it in the case of local calls, roaming, or calls between the fixed network and mobile phones, and vice versa. Therefore this is a clear example of market imperfection. Perhaps it is not cost-effective for new firms to work at this level. Consequently, there is a need for regulations here, otherwise the citizens in more remote regions will be at a disadvantage because they will not be connected, i.e. they will not be part of the universal service. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we are calling for the state to be given the right to intervene. Secondly, we demand a more flexible formulation of universal service, for e-mail and the Internet used to be considered a luxury. These days, people who do not have these services are almost being discriminated against. Accordingly, Internet access ought to be counted as one of the universal services. Thirdly, needless to say, drops in price must not be to the detriment of quality of service. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are agreed on transparency and on the matter of choice. Pre-selection is restrictive for the subscriber and is something they should be able to sue over. Like you, we are in favour of having transmission obligations. You have also taken account of health in recital E, which is a matter particularly dear to the heart of the Greens. </p>
<p class="contents">By and large, we support your report, however we cannot support 8a or 8b, both of which are new. 8a is contrary to the Amsterdam Protocol No. 32 and to the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive. I have only this to say about 8b new: the ‘television without frontiers’ directive is not the object of this dossier. The guidelines for a common audiovisual policy are discussed in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and specifically in the Veltroni report. This discussion has only just begun and we must not prejudge the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to issue a rebuke of the Commission for failing to wait for Parliament. It is continuing to work on an independent basis. I just felt that this needed to be said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Market or society. We are indeed dealing with a market. That much is certain. Everything is moving in that direction. It remains to be seen, however, what sort of a society we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though Mr van Velzen’s report is very technical, the purely technical issues end by confirming two other problems of a technical nature which are, moreover, brought up again in the amendments: access for all, democratic access to this information society market, and the definition of a public service, henceforth known as a universal service, without forgetting the development of the content of these information and communication networks, a content which seems to interest so few people, which never fails to amaze me.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the subject of democratic access, people will tell me that other reports and other programmes, the one on “e-learning” for example, exist to support the efforts made by European countries to promote access to the Internet and to new technologies. These programmes must not, however, be just a salve for the existing infrastructures, specifically the ones we are currently setting in place. May we hope for some consistency on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Next, what form can a universal service take nowadays? What undertakings must Europe and the Member States set themselves in this regard? Affordable access to all communication services is not enough to guarantee a universal service. We need financial commitments from the Member States in order to guarantee a public service, in schools and libraries for example, and we also need them to monitor the quality and diversity of the proposed information content.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the matter of content. It might be feared that our reintroducing this question could be taken for an automatic reflex on our part. But how is it possible to agree to our opinion being consulted on the regulation or on competition without our being asked to deal with the matter of the content of information and communication?</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, 94 of the world’s 106 most visited web sites are American. While Europe is certainly ahead of the United States in terms of mobile communication, it lags behind them specifically in relation to the handling of content. This reminder is, perhaps, just a reflex, as I tell myself every time our only concerns with regard to the new economy are the actual networks. Is it, however, possible that the matter has become urgent today?</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to note Amendments Nos 6 and 7 to the van Velzen report clearly acknowledging that the question of content was a problem. I also take the fact that, on 24 May, the Commission adopted a programme that was proposed to promote European content and multilingualism on the Internet, as a very good sign. It is only a start, but let us not forget that we also have the task of building a cultural Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to focus on a few points relating to this important report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must keep pace with the technological changes which are taking place globally at this time. If the economies of the Union are to prosper and succeed, businesses must be apprised of new changes in the field of information technology. In many ways, the Union is ahead of the United States of America in the field of technology. EU-technology in mobile-phone systems is well advanced. Most Union countries have extensive competition in the field of mobile-phone markets. This is going to continue with the next set of mobile-phone licences known as UMTS licences when the respective EU governments give them out.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support competition in the telecommunications market, because it is good for consumers in terms of the prices they pay for telecommunication services. The European Union is behind the United States of America with the Internet. EU governments must redouble their efforts to ensure that all businesses are fully linked up to the Internet and e-commerce companies must be promoted at every turn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for social policies, in terms of promoting the Internet in rural parts of Europe, to be incorporated in the EU strategies. I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating Commissioner Byrne for setting in train the process for the regulating of contracts on the Internet. The Commissioner has started this process of looking into mechanisms to guarantee consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to bring forward proposals to regulate procedures and for dispute mechanisms for contractual arrangements entered into via the Internet. Entering into contracts on the Internet must bring with it regulatory procedures and dispute-regulation mechanisms so that consumers will enter into such contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in my own country of Ireland there are 750 software firms employing over 23,000 people. I am confident that this sector will increase as new opportunities and e-commerce fields open up to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sector, however, not only needs regulation at European level, above all it needs regulation on a global scale. These rules require the necessary flexibility, as rapporteur Van Velzen pointed out with good reason. After all, it is unclear what the future holds for that sector. We therefore need to restrict ourselves to prescribing pre-conditions for future developments and proposing measures which can enter into force at the time when the developments are in the offing.</p>
<p class="contents">The drafting of pre-conditions requires attention to both the supply and demand side of the communications market. Fair competition is vital to suppliers. Accordingly, our pre-conditions should in any event create equal access to national frequencies and infrastructures. Pre-conditions are important to consumers too. A new social chasm between consumers who take part in the information society and those who do not is undesirable. </p>
<p class="contents">In the field of universal services and the supply of public services, the national authorities should, therefore, be free to intervene within the market. However, this sector is not just about access for everyone and as much freedom as possible for the consumer. It is not enough to optimise the customer’s freedom of choice by providing information on the services on offer. The national Member States, the Commission, but also other international legislators are required to act prescriptively in the supply of services. The Commission’s current stance against child pornography and racism are good examples of this. However, there is a need for standards which apply universally and worldwide. I would like to call for the standards of the Bible to be applied, as they offer the consumer the best protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that it would be appropriate to proceed to a new phase in the liberalisation of the electronic communications sector which will mirror market developments and constantly evolving technology. </p>
<p class="contents">The new legislation should affect all the communications infrastructures and related services by means of recommendations and codes of conduct and other vehicles. If we keep the regulations to a minimum, this will ensure proper coherence between market developments and the reference legislative framework in addition to promoting investment by operators, improving the quality of the services and, therefore, giving the consumer greater benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, considering the substantial increase in the number and size of operators and the changing conditions of competition over the market as a whole, the national regulatory authorities should, henceforth, start to use their competences, moving on from an <span class="italic">ex ante</span> approach to regulation to an <span class="italic">ex post</span> approach. In a scenario where the issuing of licences is genuinely liberalised, no prior approval should be required by the regulators before operators can enter the market unless this is strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission that, in this second phase of opening up of the market, while full competition has not yet been achieved, it would be appropriate for there to be specific legislation governing the activities of telecommunications companies which used to have monopolies and whose economic and financial strength is such as to influence the market.</p>
<p class="contents">When competition is consolidated and the free telecommunications services market has fully developed its potential in the various sections, it will be possible to reduce the sector rules and the special obligations for the operators dominating the market which I have just referred to. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will have to be careful not to create inequalities between the different national product and service markets. Moreover, in the longer term, a joint public and private action appears essential in order to make it possible for all people to use all the telematic services of a distinct social nature, such as telemedicine, teleworking, electronic public administration services and electronic commerce. These objectives are an integral part of the well-known e-Europe initiative, which is a universal service based on a development philosophy which is social as well as economic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There are two questions which, to my mind, need to be asked about this report: how much regulation and what sort of regulation do we need to promote a competitive European internal market? As I see it, three questions have emerged from our joint debate. Firstly, there is the question as to what the role of the Member States should be. European rules are needed for a European market, for example the unbundling of subscriber access, and of course the much-lamented principle of subsidiarity means that we need rules where they can best be made use of. This may be at Member State level, but it may also be at EU level. That being the case, we should at least issue a reminder about the need for reinforced cooperation and coordination between the national regulators in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second issue – also raised by previous speakers – concerns the auctions, or beauty contests. I will be quite honest with you, opinion is extremely divided in my group too, on which of the two is the best method. I still think that auctions are the most viable way of finding the most efficient and effective operator in a competitive setting. Of course it is a problem that some Member States opt for this method and others go for a different one. That is bound to lead to distortions in competition. When these come to light, surely it falls to the Commission to intervene. We should learn our lesson from that and make sure that in future, everyone is treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, how long can rules be put in place for? There will need to be a review as of the year 2005, at all events, for no one is in a position to say at the present time what we will need in the way of new sector-specific rules in the year 2005, or indeed whether we will need them at all.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I have a comment of a personal nature to make about the caller location system and the 112 emergency number. We had a few discussions about this in committee. I must admit that having lived behind the iron curtain in the Eastern block for four decades, and having grown up there, I am always sceptical about being monitored and controlled ‘big brother is watching you’ style. I therefore think it is absolutely essential where the 112 emergency number is concerned, for the prior consent of the user to be required for the use of caller location facilities, even in the event of an emergency. But that is something I personally feel strongly about. We will find a reasonable solution when it comes to the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have made the point often enough that everyone should have access to the new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, neither basic provisions nor universal service are defined. And it is so very important to define these tasks to my mind, because otherwise the marginalised target groups will find themselves even further back in the queue, for example the elderly, the disabled or immigrants. All the report says is how the undefined basic services are to be achieved, i.e. more market freedom and less state intervention. You are right to note that the state is not providing, in an optimum manner, for fair access to information technologies. But companies are even less motivated in this respect. They are only interested in developing for the market, as was reconfirmed by the UNIC Summit at the weekend.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It will only be possible to stop people from becoming digital illiterates if we afford them self-access to the new media in schools, universities and other public spheres. Only then will people become truly innovative in their dealings with these technologies, and will a discussion about opportunities and risks take place. Unfortunately, this is where the report is lacking in concrete proposals. For example, for there to be fair access, the state should not spend billions on Microsoft programmes when there are more democratic, innovative and secure software versions, namely Open Source, available for free on the Internet. </p>
<p class="contents">The opportunities are there but they are not being used. The issue of data protection, as Mr Glante has just mentioned, may have been raised here on more than one occasion, but there are no ideas forthcoming as to how to give it concrete form. It is all very vague. There has been one concrete proposal to this effect, i.e. automatic caller location for purposes other than emergency calls, for commercial applications that is. Firstly, even if the consent of the user were to be required, this would start to chip away at fundamental rights, and secondly, the proposal is completely out of touch because it has long been possible to ascertain the location of callers using mobile phones without obtaining the user’s prior consent. The market is not a panacea, and secondly, the statements on data protection are still vague. As such, commercial interests are taking precedence over the protection of fundamental rights. Therefore I intend to vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that Mr van Velzen’s political approach differs from mine does not prevent me from recognising a serious piece of work, such as the report which he has presented to us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the European Union’s policy in the telecommunications sector is to fully liberalise the markets, develop competition and privatise public-sector corporations. The Communist Party of Greece is fundamentally opposed to such policies. We take the view that basic sectors, especially sectors of strategic importance to the economy and to the very existence of a country, should be under government control. This ensures that the necessary investments are made in order to develop these sectors and provide services even to the most remote areas, such as islands, and, at the same time, it guarantees low prices, because there is no corporate super profit motive involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s report endeavours to evaluate the application of this policy to date and proposes measures for the future. The Commission should recognise that the number one problem which needs to be addressed is the fact that the market is monopolised by a few extremely strong players. This is proof positive of the fact that the European Union is guilty of hypocrisy when it maintains that it wants to impose equal and fair operating and profit rules, since its very policy takes us in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, not only do the various agreements, alliances, acquisitions, mergers, etc. not want competition; they indirectly abolish it by creating extremely powerful groups which crush small- and medium-sized businesses or force them into submission. Even yesterday’s competitors are coming to private agreements and arrangements, thereby adulterating the competition. Under these circumstances, it is idealistic to believe that measures to strengthen competition further will prevent the market from being control by a handful of monopolies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member new to this House with his first involvement in work on the telecommunications directive, I have certainly learnt a lot from the process, and I think other colleagues have as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus on some of the crucial issues raised in the report and, in particular, the whole transitional period towards a future single open market for all electronic communications. The important thing about this debate is that by and large there is a strong consensus towards that. Our colleague, Mr Alyssandrakis, does not agree with that – and it is always good to have his distinctive contribution to our debates. But Mr van Velzen has quite rightly focussed on some of the difficulties in making that transition and how it is going to be regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue on which there is important consensus is that we do not want a centralised regulatory body at European-Union level. We want to see the national regulatory authorities have the responsibility, but there are going to be new responsibilities which will need a strong measure of coordination to ensure that process is carried out quickly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Liikanen that one of the things to be addressed is that in thinking about combining the regulatory authorities with the overall competition authorities in each Member State, let us not forget that those competition authorities are already taking on significant extra responsibilities through the activities and policies of his colleague, Mr Monti. We need to ensure that those competition authorities are adequately staffed, conscious of their European responsibilities and prepared to buy in to the coordination process that is being proposed in this report, because they will have that crucial responsibility. That will need very careful monitoring, a lot of cooperation between the Member State governments and as Mr van Velzen said, we as politicians have an important role to play in putting pressure on the Member States to ensure that process is achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the question of universal service, which has already been mentioned earlier. It is quite right that in his report Mr van Velzen does not propose that we should move to an extension of universal service at the moment. Everything we are talking about shows how fast the market is changing. The value added, the commercial potential of every connection is going up all the time. In remote areas the potential for remote shopping and remote services is going to be much enhanced in the new world we are living in. It is right to keep that under review and not to make a significant change at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we study this issue horizontally, first there is the production of content, then the transmission systems and associated services, which are dealt with in Mr van Velzen’s report, and then comes the terminal equipment: televisions, telephones and computers. These are manufactured by companies whose methods and staff have encroached on each other’s territories, and this causes the confusion, although there is also new business, which is the issue here. We need an analysis of the situation as a whole from the Commission. I, too, believe that we can expect one, as the Commissioner has looked long and hard at the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The large converged monopolies are becoming a problem for us Europeans since they often make mutual agreements on regulations to control the market and thus stifle free competition, i.e. as we deregulate here, they re-regulate: they make new regulations, and this balance – as I understood Mr van Velzen to say – is very important. In my opinion, the digital divide<span class="italic"> </span>has already happened. It is just a question of how to get rid of it, as this equipment and hardware is so expensive that the only people to possess it are those who can afford to use it in converged form.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the universal service, about which my learned colleague, Mr Harbour, spoke. Perhaps there is no need to define it, but it should be returned to, as this concept is constantly evolving. We are always having to return to the matter of the universal service, as it must be made available. It may involve, for example, hospital services, consultation services, and other important services of this type. I agree with Mary Read that UMTS should have been included here, as they provide everything we can get from elsewhere – perhaps they were omitted for reasons of economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say one last word on spectrum auctions. They are causing Europe to lag behind America, and this to me is a serious issue, this process that works against an <span class="italic">e</span>Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need competition if we are to have any chance at all of creating the necessary conditions for the information society. At the same time, however, we want to afford EU citizens equal and secure access to these IT facilities. This report demonstrates this in the form of important points. I would like to touch on four of them.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the report emphasises the need to separate regulation from infrastructure and content. This is absolutely essential if we are to secure not just a stronger market, but also greater diversity of information for citizens in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report is in favour of using open standards and the common interface to secure access for all citizens to the information society and to enable them to participate in it from a technological point of view.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, accordingly, it is both right and logical to use must carry rules to secure transmission opportunities for public service broadcasters under the terms of the content of their task.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, I would like to point out that what we need to do now is to analyse very carefully, on the basis of this report, what conclusions we should draw if we are to secure a broadly-based right to information for all citizens in the future. I hope there will be sound cooperation between the Commission and Parliament at the forthcoming discussions on the new directive, and also on the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a matter, here, of the European Commission providing the European Union with a world class communication infrastructure with the best possible quality/price offer, if not the lowest possible prices. Of course, no one can disagree with this objective, and I am in favour of it myself. As for the means of achieving it, however, this is a very different matter and, personally speaking, I refuse to validate the rapporteur’s excessively liberal alternatives which go beyond the text presented by the Commission, which, however, is intended to promote the competitive European single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add four points, which I consider are important, to this debate. Firstly, regarding the principle of competition, I could never accept this being considered an end in itself. Secondly, regarding monitoring, I am not in favour of subjecting national regulatory authorities to outside supervision. Thirdly, regarding the allocation of the frequencies necessary for UMTS licences, I think this must remain within the remit of the Member States. Fourth and finally, regarding the universal service, I am in favour of quickly implementing a review mechanism which is transparent, proportional and non-discriminatory, and I endorse the request to place Internet access within the scope of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, while thanking our rapporteur for his work, I incline more towards the Commission’s view on this case than the rapporteur’s, some of whose liberal, or even ultraliberal ideas I find rather disturbing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr van Velzen on an excellent report. I totally support his emphasis on the need to protect the European consumer. We must at all costs ensure that the revolution in technology benefits everyone equally and that we do not create an information underclass. We also need more transparency, especially in roaming and international tariffs. I believe we should be looking at making invoices much clearer, for example, so that the consumer can tell whether he or she has chosen the right tariff. Where I differ with the rapporteur, however, is with his concerns on spectrum auctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Auctions are a fast, transparent, fair and economically efficient way of allocating the scarce resources of radio spectrum. Governments should not be trying to judge who will be innovative and successful. Industry, not government, is best placed to judge the opportunities offered by third-generation mobile telephony.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate today and in committee criticisms have been levelled at allocating spectrum through auctions. It has been suggested that auctions are simply a device to provide extra money for governments. That is wrong. The fact that they raise money is subordinate to other aims such as fairness and economic efficiency. A well-defined auction with well-informed bidders ensures that licences are awarded to operators that can generate greatest economic benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been claimed that licence costs will just be passed on to the consumer. I do not believe so. Auctions allow the market to determine the commercial value of scarce radio spectrum. More importantly, they give greater opportunities to new market entrants. Beauty contests often favour incumbents with established track records. Auctions are fairer than picking winners, which can be more subjective and less transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, what we are trying to do is to ensure that the EU maintains its position as the world leader in mobile telephony. The only way to maintain the EU's global lead in this sector is by maintaining a balance between regulation and innovation and not ruling any option out. I believe this report will help us reach this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commission for its professional work, because it has endeavoured to stimulate dialogue and discussion. Europe’s strength is its objective problem-solving ability, and not rejection of dialogue. I believe we must have transparency, particularly where pricing is concerned. We want to be able to ascertain immediately, and at all times, what an incoming or outgoing call costs. We want to make it possible for there to be a benchmark, which the most efficient and competent operator can actually implement. We need transparency in this sector to this end.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, we also want portability of numbers, so that a number is a personal distinguishing feature and people can actually be recognised by their numbers. It should be possible for there to be portability without the number issuer being able to charge for it. Of course, it should also be possible for there to be number portability from the mobile to the fixed network, and perhaps also to other future technologies. The emergency number 112 has very special significance. I myself have advocated in the past that 112-operators must be able to deal with calls in the official languages of the European Union, and that it should, of course, also be possible to ascertain the caller’s location, because it is in emergency situations, for example in the event of fire or accident, that a person is most likely to be in a state of shock and is often unable to provide a precise definition of their location. Therefore, I believe it would do those who find themselves in emergency situations a great service if it were possible to ascertain their location automatically.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The caller location facility should be regulated where consumers so desire, but in a clear and transparent manner. It is absolutely vital for there to be transparency in relation to the costs, and for no contracts to be awarded on the quiet here, unbeknown to the public and the consumer, but which still have to be paid for. Hence all operators in this sector must be governed by the same regulatory framework. Needless to say, it is also important to tackle damaging content. We should give thought, in this respect, to whether it would be possible to conduct studies analysing who in the European Union, is actually responsible for tackling damaging content.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the proceeds from auctions. I believe this is another area in which we should offer best practice models as to what should happen with the funds, so that it is not just used to cover debts but is used mainly for forward-looking investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would stress, in particular, the fact that the legislation which we are going to vote on and adopt tomorrow will, of necessity, prove to be a regulation which will become obsolete within a very short space of time. Technological development in the sector is, in fact, so rapid that Parliament and the Commission will have to go back to the issue in a very few years’ time and update the legislation we adopt now.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would argue that the laws on telecommunications should be kept rigorously separate from laws governing other sectors, particularly the TV information and broadcasting sector, and this point will have to be clarified tomorrow when we vote. With specific regard to communications, I feel that this is a good starting point and that we all agree upon its structure and substance. The rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, has done some excellent work, for which all thanks are due to him, although we must be aware that any regulations we adopt today can, by definition, only be limited in time and are destined to become rapidly obsolete.</p>

We now have before us a large package of reforms which it is vitally important that we adopt and implement swiftly in order to further the process of freeing up markets. It is good that Mr van Velzen’s excellent report gives weight to the importance of common competition legislation to promote competition in the telecommunications sector. It will be important in applying common competition legislation, however, that the legal provisions relating to a dominant market position are interpreted in a way that does not discriminate against operators in smaller markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has reservations about licence auctions for third generation wireless communications. I am also worried, for my own part, about how licence fees will affect the development of markets. As spectrum distribution will be the responsibility of Member States, however, we in Parliament have to accept that competition strategies in the different countries will vary. Only time will show what the most rational solution will be. It is also important that the trend should be towards a technologically more neutral operational environment, and that the sector-oriented approach be abandoned as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger of too much regulation must also be taken into account in good time. I support the ‘soft law’ approach in the creation of the new operational environment, in a way, however, that the legislator is given ample opportunity to make his or her position known to the Commission and the Council, before recommendations are made concerning the matter or other decisions taken revising the operational environment. I would like to ask the Commissioner how the Commission intends to promote this ‘co-regulation’ approach. How will it be possible for Parliament to exert sufficient influence?</p>
<p class="contents">I would still like to stress that competition should be promoted openly and transparently, to a degree that is adequate, and not through price policy regulation. Tariffs must be open, consumers must be able to acquire information regarding the cost of calls easily, and pricing mechanisms must safeguard the ability people have to compare prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to say that everything Wim van Velzen tackles turns out well, and his report is highly principled in its responsible treatment of the issue, which he makes his own. The communications industry is having an increasingly influential effect on our lives. It has an impact on the economy, the information society, global competition, Europe’s position in the world and employment.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, the communications industry also has an effect on democracy because it enables more and more people to participate in the democratic process. It increases the transparency of political activity. We must continue the privatisation programme. Competition led to price reductions, rapid innovation and diversity of supply. The organisation principle underlying the social market economy demands liberalisation and competition on the one hand and necessary rules on the other, so as to be able to do justice to a sense of social responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said. I should like to add just three points by way of conclusion. Communication also means information. I therefore call upon the European Parliament and the Commission to step up the involvement of all public bodies in their information campaigns and to enlighten them about the new media.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I call upon all public bodies to get themselves an e-mail address, to acquire their own homepage, to own an SMS mobile phone, and to involve the constituency media in their communication by using the new media. I urge the European Parliament and all national parliaments to establish a file containing all the e-mail addresses of all the public bodies, because we should not just be drawing up framework directives, but actually making use of them as public bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in my opinion, further study of certain areas is necessary, such as the way the competition criteria are applied and how to tackle a market which is as yet imperfect. </p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that excellent results have already been achieved in the mobile telephony sector, I would argue – and the rapporteur has put in a great of deal of work in this area which has certainly paid off – that the cable transmissions sector is developing new infrastructures which may require convergence of regulatory policies. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the final objective is liberalisation where the general competition rules guarantee the legality of the procedures, favouring a more competitive market and producing better results for the end user in terms of both services and price. These are further reasons why I feel that the directives’ application period should be limited, so that it can be determined to what extent the sector is still in need of legislation and whether that legislation would be able to react swiftly to the developments in a market which is constantly changing. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I feel that it is important for Parliament to express its disapproval of the auction system. Auctions tend to push licence fees up above their effective economic value, and this increase is then passed on to the consumer as prices are raised and it is no longer possible to introduce new services. The Member States which have applied this system should, moreover, not treat the profits as their own general resources but should use them to promote the development of the information society and electronic commerce, as they were called upon to do by the Lisbon Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the true sense of this communication and my first request to the Commission is that we act in this area diligently, and with some urgency, since time is passing at Internet speed. Each year is equivalent to four years and we ask that those proposals included in the Commission’s legislative programme be communicated to Parliament as soon as possible. I think that I can say, on behalf of the whole House, that we will show a special interest in making the parliamentary procedure as quick as possible, as dictated by the importance of the issues in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the citizens expect this of us and that the Treaty of Amsterdam allows us to shorten and speed up these processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Many important things have been said. Allow me to support what has been said with regard to universal service, access for schools, etc. However, there are three questions which seem to me to be more problematic. Firstly, we must establish a better definition of what public service means, failing which we will not be able to make progress, and for the same reason we must also define what the general interest in the field of telecommunications really means. Secondly, we must separate the regulations for private open television and public television, regardless of the transmission system. Furthermore – and this has already been said – it is necessary to promote dialogue between the national regulators and the regulators of society, of the private sectors, on this “co-regulation” which is a distinguishing mark for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I will say that it is necessary to protect – and we are relying on the diligence of Commissioner Bolkestein who is responsible for this area – this system which we are putting in place on copyright, which is one of the great traditions of European culture which is in real danger in this new state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, I first wish to join in the congratulations of many here today to Mr van Velzen, whose profound knowledge and experience can be seen in this important report. I also want to congratulate the whole Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the quality of its work. The debate here shows that many members of that committee have taken part not only in the reflections on this report but also on the whole range of issues on the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with most of the report and welcomes the conclusions and recommendations. The report reflects a deep understanding of the sector and what sector-specific regulation should do to support future development of the electronic communications area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the goals of the report to regulate with a view to achieving a competitive market in this sector. We also share an understanding of how sector-specific rules can contribute to this objective. Furthermore, the report accurately notes the two kinds of <span class="italic">ex ante</span> regulation needed: first, the regulation needed to inject effective competition into the market. This includes a symmetric regulation related to market power and other pro-competitive regulations, such as number portability. In this respect, I welcome the fact that the report pays attention to the need to ensure that number portability is not impeded by technical measures or other arrangements which limit consumers' choice of operators and service providers. Second, the regulation needed in respect of general public policy objectives, like consumer protection and universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concurs with the Commission's intention to withdraw <span class="italic">ex ante</span> regulation needed to substitute for competition and to allow the normal competition rules to apply once the markets in this sector are competitive. It is also noteworthy that this report represents the shared vision of what the sector can contribute to society and to individuals. Looking in the same direction is an important step in ensuring that everyone reaches the desired destination.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes that in order to be able to respond quickly to market developments, the directive should be in place during 2001 and that the working period of the directive should be limited to the year 2005. With regard to the fast adoption of directives, the Commission totally agrees. As to limiting the life span of the directive to 2005, this raises some questions. The risk is that it would weaken the credibility of legislation and, in particular, the independence of the regulators. However, of course we are ready to discuss any comments made in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts that there is a certain tension between legal certainty and flexibility. Our approach to flexibility is to allow the regulators to determine on the basis of a close-to-the market analysis that effective competition in the market allows the <span class="italic">ex ante</span> rules to be dismantled. This sends the right signals to markets. Otherwise major players will have an incentive to simply delay until the time period expires.</p>
<p class="contents">It also takes account of the different levels of competition in each Member State and the different speeds of development, both of which the report recognises as needing consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">On licensing, Parliament calls for one-stop shopping in respect of authorisations in this sector. The Commission's proposals would both harmonise and simplify the process that companies go through in order to provide communications services. If the current widely diverse system were retained, then the one-stop shop model would be logical as the report says. If the harmonised registration system is the solution, it could be as simple as the one-stop shop model. We must consider the alternatives at the end of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Velzen has sent me a written question on the auctions. I will use the normal internal procedures to reply to that question, but perhaps I can make some comment at this time. I will return to this issue in the formal way. The same question was put by Mrs Matikainen-Kallström.</p>
<p class="contents">According to current law, Directive 97(13), Member States determine which procedures to follow in allocating the limited-frequency spectrum available for third-generation networks, provided they comply with the principles of objectivity, non-discrimination, proportionality and transparency established by Community law. The Commission is of the view that the use of auction procedures for the allocation of radio frequencies for third-generation mobile networks is not in itself contrary to those principles and as such cannot be subject to infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the need to foster the development of innovative services and competition, it depends on the economic effect of the various auction formulae used. These are dependent on a variety of variables – length of licence, rules of payment for licence fees, conditions for network deployment, roaming obligations, etc. – which cannot yet be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to monitor the licensing process in Member States with great attention to ensure that the above-mentioned principles are respected. It is making an ongoing assessment of the economic impact of procedures used. I will return to this issue in detail, when I reply to the written question of Mr van Velzen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Matikainen-Kallström put forward the question about local laws and also put the question about the local loop. How can we guarantee that the liberalisation of the last mile will take place? When the Commission discussed this issue last time it was decided to make a recommendation to Member States to liberalise the last mile so that both full access and shared access can be guaranteed in the local loop. I find it a very important issue. Added to that, my colleague, the competition Commissioner, will monitor the issue from the viewpoint of potential abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have decided to put that issue, too, into the legal proposal for the future legal framework. The first question is: could this part be separated out to get it through more quickly? But I agree with your concern that the question of the local loop is the biggest issue this year. In two or three years' time we will have other issues, but right now we have the network ready, connecting lines everywhere and we can use the existing network with new technology to achieve an enormous increase in broad band everywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Glante asked the question of who decides what. This is a big issue which we have discussed in many contexts. Some people say we should have a European regulator to guarantee full European coherence on those issues. On the other hand there are people who say that it should all go to the Member States' national authorities and national regulators. Our intention is to try to balance this issue so that we have some coherence at European level, coherence of interpretation, so that we can have a European level playing field but not to interfere in the issues where the national regulators can do their jobs in a coherent manner. We shall come back to that issue in our final proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I want once more to express my thanks for the report and for the very interesting debate today. The Commission will look forward to working together with the European Parliament in the course of the forthcoming legislative process. After the debate and your votes it will go back to the Commission and I hope that we will be able to make proposals at the end of this month. I share Mrs Palacio's wish that on this issue the European Parliament and the Council will be able to take decisions very speedily. Of course there will continue to be a need for an in-depth discussion, but we must be able to create a competent and clear legal framework for electronic communications in the new converged world. Otherwise the European economy will suffer severe losses and European consumers, too, will lose the possibilities that new technology can give them if applied in the proper legal framework which guarantees full competition between operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
