One is a decision to ratify this Convention on behalf of the European Community; the other the regulation required in order to implement the Convention in the Community. The decision on ratification hardly needs further elaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for an implementing regulation reflects the position of both the Commission and the Member States: that the provisions should go beyond purely incorporating the Convention, which was the result of a compromise between all of the parties to the negotiations. The Community called for stricter provisions in certain respects but did not manage to push them through.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the proposals are well balanced and that they will contribute to the achievement of the Community’s objective of improving the protection of human health and the environment in importing countries – especially developing countries – from hazardous chemicals, without preventing the smooth application of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful for the support the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given to the proposals. It wants the Community to ratify the Convention early on, in accordance with the spirit of the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit. The Commission hopes, therefore, that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the implementing regulation, which it considers to be a prerequisite for the work on ratification to continue. In this connection, the Commission wishes to stress the efforts of the Council and Parliament in making progress with the work on the proposals, above all, the compromises reached as the basis for a possible agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading of the proposal for an implementing regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, something which I should have said right at the start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, I do not often get 10 minutes of speaking time but I hope I will not need it all. We have before us two reports regarding the import and export of chemical products.</p>
<p class="contents">The first report supports the approval of the Treaty of Rotterdam in respect of specific hazardous chemical products and pesticides in international trade. I propose that we do this as quickly as possible, given that the Treaty can enter into force from the moment that it has been ratified by sufficient parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concentrates mainly on the following three points:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, parties to the Treaty can only export chemicals included in the Appendix to another party to the Treaty if they have obtained prior approval from the importing country. This is called the PIC procedure – <span class="italic">Prior Informed Consent.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, new products may be added to the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a party exporting prohibited or strictly regulated chemical products must provide information to the importing party. Moreover, all products listed in the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies, must be labelled.</p>
<p class="contents">These matters have already been more or less laid down in a regulation dating back to 1992. The chemical industry also began to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam voluntarily in April of this year. There is therefore no longer any reason to delay the ratification of this Treaty any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report aims to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam through a regulation. This regulation goes further than the Treaty of Rotterdam on a number of points. It is somewhat stricter, more precise and broader, and this can be seen as an improvement to the legislation. More has also been done in respect of providing information to third countries, especially developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A more difficult issue is that in the original proposal by the Commission, the Commission itself wanted to impose a monopoly on the procedures. This is not sensible, as Member States do not all have the same legislation with regard to chemical products. I am referring particularly to pesticides and biocides. As you know, it will take another five to ten years before we have Community legislation on this area. It is also possible that, even after this period, Member States will make use of exceptional provisions. It is therefore a good idea to leave some leeway for the Member States in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted 15 amendments. The legal basis for the regulation has been amended from the internal market to the environment. This means codecision for the European Parliament. More freedom has also been created for the individual Member States, meaning that individual Member States can pass more far-reaching measures. This will be evident from the fact that individual Member States may also make proposals with regard to adding new products to the list to which prior informed consent applies, as there is still a group of products for which there is still no harmonised European legislation, such as pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">Another improvement is that the lists of hazardous products will only have to be updated each year at the most. It is very important that persistent organic products are added to this regulation. The arrangements made as part of the Treaty of Stockholm are included in the list of prohibited products.</p>
<p class="contents">As it seems that the Council had a similar vision to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as<span class="italic"> </span>rapporteur I have tried to complete the legislative process at first reading. For this purpose I was given the mandate by the parliamentary groups. The talks on this area were most satisfactory. The Council adopted most of the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Council’s mostly technical adjustments were easy to incorporate. This led to 42 new amendments, which were signed by most of the groups. The Council sent a letter which promised that if the European Parliament accepted the total package of compromises, the Council would lay down the common position accordingly. This means that we could complete matters by the end of the first reading, saving a considerable amount of time – at least a year. I am really pleased to hear from Mrs Wallström that the European Commission is also able to endorse the measures wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to request that special attention be paid to Amendment No 22. With regard to the scope, it has been agreed with the Council that the rules will in any case apply to amounts exceeding 10 kg. This will be very sensible in practice for feasibility and control purposes. This is also part of the whole package of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the package of compromises before you is a very satisfactory result that I can heartily recommend to Parliament. The voting slip comprises 4 blocks. Block 1 covers the compromise amendments with the Council. If block 1 is adopted, block 2 will no longer apply. Block 3 comprises the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy which were approved by the Council, so we must vote in favour of these. Finally block 4 comprises 3 amendments which must be rejected by Parliament, based on the total compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Danish Presidency for their proper, constructive cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal for a Decision requests ratification as soon as possible of the Rotterdam Convention, whose main objective is to regulate the international trade in hazardous chemicals, but also, and this is what we believe in Parliament, to protect human health and the environment, and it is important that this be done now. We have therefore asked that the legal basis be changed from Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which regulates commercial trade, to Article 175, in accordance with codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Regulation, which is exhaustive and very strict, lays down very strict rules for intra-Community trade in pesticides. What we are asking for is a degree of flexibility. As Mr Blokland has already said, we have reached an important agreement after many discussions amongst all the political groups, so that, after the change in the legal basis, this package of amendments can be ratified and accepted both by the Commission and by the Council, and so that Parliament’s position can end at first reading and we can reach a conclusion which we all agree on.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all regulations – as Mr Blokland also said – relating to pesticides are equivalent in all countries, and the Commissioner is perfectly aware that they will be unified, but not before the minimum time limit of between 5 and 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on pesticides and the analyses for approval are very delayed, since of the over eight hundred active areas to be regulated, not even one hundred have been analysed. We can therefore assume that this issue will be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation we are going to approve, on the prior informed consent procedure, is important because it gives the receiver prior information on what the sender is going to send. This is not only valid for the Member States of the European Union but also for non-Member countries, to which we must apply the same requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Members of Parliament to support the report as it stands, with the voting list proposed by Mr Blokland, whom I warmly congratulate, since he has done great work on an issue which is very controversial and difficult and highly scientific. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by agreeing with the last speaker. This is a good report and the rapporteurs have worked really hard on it.</p>
<p class="contents">A first-reading agreement, though it is not absolutely certain yet, is what we would like to see. We think that by and large the amendments are sensible additions to the text. We are a little concerned about the proposals on Member States including chemicals in the PIC procedure and think that everyone should be properly consulted if that is going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this measure without delay. It will help to improve our public health and environmental protection, both inside and outside the European Union. We are anxious to go through with it and we will be supporting the vast majority of the amendments and following the rapporteur tomorrow. We would like to see a solution as quickly as possible. We need more international agreements like this and we need speed. Many pieces of chemical legislation have taken too long to be properly implemented in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, the Danish Presidency and the Commission for making a real effort to arrive at a solution which is satisfactory and acceptable for us all, even if not all of our amendments have been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The intentions of the Rotterdam Convention are important, and it is also important that it be ratified as quickly as possible, because it concerns the trade in extremely hazardous chemicals. I also think that it can be said that the Commission did an excellent job in presenting this proposal for a regulation, which is to replace the present legislation on hazardous chemicals and pesticides with the rules of the Rotterdam Convention. The proposal actually goes beyond the Convention, for example in proposing that the export notification procedure, too, must be extended to cover articles containing so-called ‘unreacted’ forms of chemicals and that the export of certain chemicals must be banned outright. I am extremely pleased with the proposal, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this whole exercise and of the Convention is to improve the control of the trade in hazardous chemicals and to place joint and increased responsibility on importing and exporting countries. It is about protecting human health and the environment. For this reason, I also believe that it is reasonable and fair that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with the help of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has changed the legal basis from Article 133 to Article 175, which means that the European Parliament has codecision powers and, at the same time, enables the Member States to have stricter rules. I really hope, therefore, that we obtain a large majority, perhaps unanimity, in favour of this report tomorrow. I believe that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our rapporteur, Mr Blokland, has, as always, done a precise and excellent job, for which he deserves our thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has the objective of increasing shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among parties to the agreement in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals, thus promoting environmental and health protection. At the same time the intention is to encourage the environmentally sound use of chemicals with increased transparency and information exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">All these are aims worthy of support from the point of view of the EU’s targets, but some of the provisions now being discussed go even further than the Rotterdam Convention. For example, the rules relating to the timing and frequency of export notifications and the level of information required are clearly more advanced than the rulings of the Convention. That is how I think it ought to be too. Parties to international agreements on the environment are countries at different levels in terms of commitment and the levels agreed in the Convention do not necessarily go far enough at all with regard to the EU’s targets. For that reason, agreements on the environment in my view should always be implemented to a more ambitious degree in the EU than they would require in themselves. Only then would we achieve a dynamic that would help steer the negative development that we are seeing in the areas of the environment and human health in a healthier direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s suggestion that this proposal for a regulation should take into account the Stockholm Convention concerning POPs concluded in May last year should be supported. The objective of the proposal for a regulation is the protection of the environment and human health. That is also the main goal of the Rotterdam Convention. That is why the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, has arrived at the absolutely correct conclusion when he proposes that Article 133 of the Treaty that relates to common commercial policy should be replaced with Article 175 as a more suitable legal basis for the proposals. The legislative proposals thus also clearly come under the codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most relate to the draft implementing regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly on the legal base, as the Commission has already made clear in the Council, it believes that Article 133 – not Article 175(1) – is the correct legal base. The Commission has to reserve its right to make use of the legal means at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Given our position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept that national regulatory actions taken by Member States should only fall within the scope of the regulation and be subject to the procedures for export notification and PIC notification. It follows that the Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 20, 26, 33 and 34. On the other hand, the Commission recognises that Community import responses for PIC chemicals should, additionally, give us as complete a picture as possible. The Commission can therefore accept Amendments 11 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Commission's role as regards Community participation in the Convention, given its position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 28. Article 14 of the Commission proposals provides for the possibility of an export ban for certain chemicals to be listed in Annex V. The Commission knows the wish of Parliament and the Council to add the chemicals subject to the POPs Convention to Annex V, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant annexes to that convention. However, the Commission can accept Amendment 56, as drafted, together with the associated Amendments 41 to 46, 48, 50 and 53.</p>
<p class="contents">The remaining amendments are technical, mainly aimed at giving greater precision to certain provisions. The Commission can accept all these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the draft ratification decision. Three amendments have been tabled and, for the reasons I have already explained, the Commission cannot accept the change of legal base proposed in Amendment 1, nor can it accept Amendment 3 that stems from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission can accept Amendment 2 which reintroduces the principle of a key Commission role in the Community's participation in the different bodies implementing the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall hand over a summary of the Commission position on oral statements, if that is acceptable to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, once again I thank Mr Blokland for his hard work on a constructive and valuable report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
