<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Voggenhuber </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the representative of the Council presidency has not been welcomed by name, so I do not know whom I should be addressing at this moment. But I do hope that a representative is here. Mr President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on behalf of which I speak here, there have been serious concerns that the Council might not manage to arrive at decisions in time to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the European Union and that the relevant legal instruments would then automatically become part of the third pillar. That is why the fact that this agreement has been reached and that the decisions have indeed been taken has been greeted with a degree of relief. That is the good news I am able to give the presidency. The bad news is that the way in which these decisions and stipulations were made has drawn heavy criticism and even protests from the overwhelming majority of our committee, and I hope that the House will share our indignation, because this is a very important matter in terms of parliamentary control and codetermination in the field of internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty itself dealt with the incorporation of the Schengen agreement, the institutional issues, the distribution of powers and the procedural arrangements in an extremely questionable and vague manner, namely by relegating these matters to an additional protocol. I do believe we must dwell on the significance of this line of approach in order to appreciate fully the nature of the criticism voiced by the committee and by Parliament. The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the European Union is surely the most important and the most complex transformation of international law into the law of the European Union. It lays the foundations on which the freedom of the individual can be enshrined in EU law, it is the means by which the Union can become an area in which freedom, justice and security are guaranteed, and it is certainly the most significant increase of powers in the field of internal security. It is a transfer of power that will have a massive impact on fundamental rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask the presidency of the Council at this point how the European institutions, and particularly the elected representatives of the European people, are to explain to the public that such a project can be implemented without involving Parliament, without informing or consulting Parliament. How are we supposed to explain that this Parliament has not even been accorded the right to deliver an opinion, that we have not even received detailed documentation and information about this scheme, and that we now have to discuss it without actually having been briefed on its details?</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to voice the view of the absolute majority of the committee by saying that this is not only a matter of the rights of Parliament, important though they may be; one of the roles in which this Parliament has always seen itself is as the advocate of fundamental rights, of civil liberties, of personal rights in the European Union, and it is difficult to serve as the advocate of the European people if we are excluded in this way from Council projects, an exclusion which we believe is contrary to the letter of the Treaty; no doubt we shall have to agree to differ once again on that point, but in any event our exclusion is entirely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I should also point out that the Council's approach once more raises the question of whether the theory of the Council's indirect legitimacy as a legislative authority stands up to scrutiny in the light of such occurrences, because the European Parliament is not the only legitimate representative body discussing these matters without the aid of documentation and being excluded from the Council's decisions and preparations; as we know, our national parliaments have been informed inadequately and at the last possible moment. In other words, we can no longer speak of genuine parliamentary control in the field of internal security, of police and judicial cooperation. That is the particular protest, the vehement protest, of the committee that I bring to your attention today, and it is not only on behalf of our committee that I call on the presidency of the Council to develop an entirely new culture of cooperation with Parliament in this extremely sensitive area of government authority and power in the domain of civil liberties and fundamental rights.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schapper, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, and on that date the Schengen system was incorporated into the European Union framework. The German Presidency has always regarded it as one of our foremost tasks to brief the European Parliament on the progress of the preparations for the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements, and I am pleased to have another opportunity to do so today, since the question of information and the form in which it is imparted has been such a crucial issue. Mr Voggenhuber, I shall also deal in detail with your comments on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to say a few words on the definition of the fruits of Schengen and their place in the EU framework. The discussions that are being held with a view to defining the substance of the Schengen cooperation arrangements and incorporating it into the legal bases of the EC Treaty and the Treaty on European Union have made good progress and are now very close to completion. The relevant draft Council decisions were noted and frozen by the General Affairs Council at its meeting of 26 April. Following yesterday's final deliberations in the Permanent Representatives Committee, the presidency is seeking the adoption of the decisions at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 10 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I make no secret of our pride in the fact that the German Presidency has succeeded, in collaboration with its partners, in answering most of the questions relating to the place of the Schengen provisions, questions which remained thorny until the very end and which were affected by a vast range of diverse political considerations. The way is clear now for an extensive examination of the substance of Schengen, which is precisely what the Treaty of Amsterdam requires. It has not been possible, however, to reach an agreement on the place of the provisions relating to the Schengen information system. While a group of Member States has been pressing for the integration of these provisions into both the first and third pillars, a number of others favour incorporation into the third pillar only. A compromise position, which the presidency supports, proposes recourse to the third pillar as far as the establishment and operation of the Schengen information system and most of the notification categories are concerned, whereas notices of refusal of entry visas and the rules on system‐related data protection would also have legal bases in the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the best efforts of the presidency, a consensus on this point has proved impossible and there is no prospect of such an agreement on the horizon. In this area – and only in this area – the legal fiction in the Schengen Protocol, which provides for the third pillar to serve as the legal basis until further notice, will apply. This, incidentally, will not prejudice the adoption of the decision determining how the legal bases are to be split. I believe that this outcome, which has yet to be finally confirmed by the Council, is acceptable. For key parts of the substance of Schengen, it will prevent innumerable disputes regarding the legal bases on which future developments are to be founded.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be exceeding my terms of reference if I were to deal with the legal bases of each of the Schengen provisions. But I must point out that, about a week ago, I sent you the drafts of the Council decisions, the aims of which are firstly to define the substance of the Schengen rules and secondly to examine that substance in detail. May I ask you to refer to those two documents for detailed information.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now briefly answer the question on the associated status of Iceland and Norway. The association of those countries with the implementation and development of the Schengen provisions will take place on the basis of an association agreement, which is due to be signed quite soon. Now that the Executive Committee of the parties to the Schengen Agreement has had its last meeting, held last week on 28 April, which means that the fruits of Schengen can be defined conclusively, it is also possible to identify the areas in which cooperation with Norway and Iceland should take place in the future. The discussions on this question are almost completed. The presidency expects that the Council will approve the agreement at its meeting on 17 and 18 May and that the agreement can be signed as part of the EEA Council meeting which is being held at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of the association agreement is the creation, at all levels of the hierarchy of EU authorities, of a joint committee through which Norway and Iceland will play their part in the shaping of decisions. In the Schengen framework, these two countries have been directly involved in the work of the authorities, with the right to express their views but without formal voting rights. A direct transfer of this form of cooperation into the EU framework is not possible. The basic rule is that participation in the work of EU bodies is the sole prerogative of Member States. Other forms of involvement, such as observer status, would not have satisfied Iceland's and Norway's legitimate need to keep contributing to the discussion process on the subjects covered by the Schengen Agreement. This is why the two countries and the Member States have agreed on the creation of a special system of committees, the main aim of which will be to serve as a platform for the discussion with Norway and Iceland of proposals and initiatives for further developing the fruits of the Schengen process.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint committee will only have very limited decision‐making powers. These will be confined to procedural matters affecting the joint committee itself and its activities. Substantive decisions on the development of the fruits of Schengen, decisions which Iceland and Norway will have helped to shape, will be taken exclusively by EU bodies, namely the Council and, where appropriate, the Permanent Representatives Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the association agreement I have just described, the draft of which I recently sent to you, the Schengen Protocol provides for the conclusion of another agreement on the legal relationship between Norway and Iceland on the one hand and the United Kingdom and Ireland on the other hand in matters relating to their recourse to the benefits of Schengen. The negotiations on this have begun. I expect that they can be completed within a short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words on the integration of the Schengen Secretariat. On 1 May 1999 the Council, acting in accordance with the written consultation procedure, decided to integrate the staff of the Schengen Secretariat into the Secretariat‐General of the Council, and I hope that a line can now be drawn under the recent debates on this subject and that the presidency, the Member States and the staff of the Council Secretariat can turn their full attention once again to the substantive work that confronts us in the remaining two months of the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the decision‐making process, it emerged that some of the Council Secretariat staff are virtually taking to the barricades in opposition to the absorption of the Schengen staff, who have not gone through the customary selection procedure. I have no sympathy with that position, because the incorporation of former members of the Schengen Secretariat has nothing to do with nepotism or favouritism. On the contrary, it serves to safeguard the subsistence of a group of people who have shown great commitment over the years to the Schengen cooperation process and who must not suffer from the integration of Schengen into the EU framework. Moreover, the Union will also benefit from the specialised knowledge and skills of the trained Schengen staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by dealing with the consultation of the European Parliament on the transfer of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework. The German Presidency recognises unreservedly that the transfer of the Schengen arrangements into the EU framework is of enormous importance to the future work of the European Parliament, and that Parliament has a legitimate interest in the various steps that have to be taken on the way to integration. Germany has always respected that interest by providing detailed information on developments in the process. Interior Minister Otto Schily, staff of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and I myself have briefed Parliament and its Internal Affairs Committee on several occasions. I might remind you that Mr Schily addressed the House on 14 January and that he spoke to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on 19 November and again on 30 March; I myself was at the meeting of the Internal Affairs Committee on 23 November, and Mr Eisel, who heads the other competent directorate in our department, has also briefed the committee twice during the past week. So I believe we have done all we could to keep Parliament and its committee informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should also point out that we have no statutory obligation to engage in formal consultation on matters concerning the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework. The sole basis for the incorporation of Schengen is the Schengen Protocol, which makes no provision for formal consultation. The consultation requirements laid down in the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties do not apply to the transfer of the Schengen system. Let me assure you once again, however, that the presidency will continue to keep the European Parliament fully briefed on the state of the integration process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Lancker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement the Council has reached on incorporating the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the Treaty is yet another of the sort of agreements that Parliament regards with extremely mixed feelings. Of course, it is wonderful that an agreement has been reached, which none of us dared hope would be achieved under the German Presidency. On 14 January this year, we adopted a resolution expressing our concern at the absence of an agreement, which would have meant that the whole of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> would have come under the third pillar. So the fact that an agreement has been reached is quite a feat, and I congratulate the German Presidency on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement also ensures that a considerable number of the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> , those dealing with the free movement of persons, asylum, immigration and border controls, are now mainly Community issues, which means that Parliament and the Court of Justice will be involved in policy in these fields in future. This too is to be welcomed. However, there are certain elements here that we find very hard to swallow because they are completely contrary to the recommendations that Parliament made in January.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost yet again, Mr President‐in‐Office, there is the role that Parliament has played. It is true that the German Presidency held various discussions with Parliament and that we were kept informed throughout the period of the negotiations, for which we are grateful to the presidency. But you cannot deny that the final documents only reached Parliament on Monday, that Monday was the first chance we had to discuss the final outcome of the negotiations, and that the consultation of Parliament is really just a joke because everything has already been decided. A political agreement has been reached and simply needs to be confirmed by the Council on 10 May.</p>
<p class="contents">You are quite right. Formally speaking you do not need to consult Parliament, but politically speaking this would not be advisable, since the choice of legal basis when incorporating Schengen into the Treaty will determine how the future <span class="italic">acquis </span> is to be developed and what the roles of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice will be. So it is a crucial decision that directly affects Parliament"s rights, which was why we felt we ought to be consulted, and consulted seriously. We even said in our resolution of 14 January that if this did not happen, Parliament would have to consider bringing a case before the Court of Justice, and I still think that the next Parliament should consider doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, this is not a matter of injured pride. This is all about democratic control, because Parliament has a number of comments to make on the substance of the agreement too. First, the President‐in‐Office has himself admitted that there is no agreement on the Schengen information system. No agreement is better than just dumping everything under the third pillar, which would have been disastrous, but for the time being the Schengen information system is to remain under the third pillar, and this is a great mistake because the SIS contains a lot of data about immigration, asylum and visas, all of which are areas where enormous problems occur on a daily basis. So I would like to ask the Council what it can do to get us out of this impasse. Incidentally, the protection of personal data is a particularly important issue with the Schengen information system, and we should not forget that the Joint Supervisory Authority produced a highly critical report here. I would therefore urge that a proposal be put forward on the basis of Article 286 providing for an efficient supervisory body to be set up, together with a proposal for the protection of personal data under the third pillar, where there is as yet no such guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also draw your attention to the Commission"s right of initiative now on the whole of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> . The Commission could provide considerable impetus here, but the Council in its wisdom has decided to keep the standing committee on Schengen implementation. This might have been justified if Schengen was to be extended, but it is unacceptable that this committee should be entrusted with monitoring the implementation of Schengen. I would therefore like to ask the Council for clearer information on this. It seems to be something of a curate"s egg. All in all, I hope that this agreement will mean that both Parliament and the next Commission will be more closely involved in the policy areas that previously came under Schengen.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cederschiöld </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, let me begin by expressing my delight over the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty. The Treaty of Amsterdam secures free movement of persons throughout Europe, but we naturally want to avoid creating a free‐for‐all for those intent on crime. Priority must be given to protecting the public. With Schengen as part of the Treaty, more effective safeguards will be offered. Finding the appropriate technical solutions has nevertheless proved a very tough task. We in the European Parliament are understandably dissatisfied with the lack of parliamentary involvement in some areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nordic countries have enjoyed free movement for a long time, and it has facilitated our relations with one another. Schengen will perform a similar service for the EU as a whole. It is therefore fortunate that the Nordic passport union will be protected. The Nordic group of countries is very vigilant when it comes to common Nordic legislation, the existence of which has meant so much to us.</p>
<p class="contents">If Nordic and EU legislation were to clash in any particular area – and there are differing views as to the likelihood of this – then we would naturally need to ensure coordination. Iceland and Norway have been granted much greater authority in respect of border controls; they now share in the overall responsibility for monitoring the Union"s external frontiers. Effective operation of the system is essential, which means ensuring that Norway and Iceland perform to the same standards as the EU countries on border controls and combating crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has maintained a good dialogue with this committee on Schengen issues, keeping us informed of events. I nonetheless wish to draw attention to the provisions in the Treaty which state that Parliament must not be sidelined in the consultation process. As representatives of the people of Europe, we deserve to be much more involved than we have been to date in these matters. The role of the European Parliament has been too weak. And we have been given far too little time for deliberation. Translations of texts were sometimes missing, meaning that people could barely follow the proceedings in committee. This is no way to approach such issues. I therefore hope that the Council will today endorse the view that, in future, sufficient time must be set aside for proper consideration of these matters. We are dealing with sensitive questions and need to ensure that a real exchange takes place between Parliament and the Council.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wiebenga </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this is the last debate we shall be having on European justice policy in this parliamentary term. When we started in July 1994, the Maastricht Treaty had just entered into force. We in the Liberal Group hoped that the Council of Ministers would be vigorous in tackling its responsibilities here, because combating large‐scale international crime and fleshing out Europe"s asylum and immigration policy are matters of considerable importance. When we now look back over this parliamentary term, we are forced to conclude – I am sorry to say – that the Council has made little progress. What has been achieved in these five years? There are 500 000 displaced people in Kosovo, but does Europe have an asylum policy? No. The Commission recently came to grief over allegations of fraud. Are the five fraud agreements in force yet? Again, no.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is the European Parliament"s fault. Here again we have often not been kept informed. When we were, we carried out our legislative duties as quickly as possible, only to find that the Council took not the slightest notice of what we said. I would say to the ministers and also to the officials – although I know that this is unusual – that they really need to change their attitude and their approach. Take Parliament seriously and stop rejecting everything so high‐handedly.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are honest, the Commission could also have played a more active role in this field. Some good progress has been made, but more could have been done. Schengen has now finally become firmly rooted in the European Union, which we have to admit is a positive development, even though Parliament was not adequately consulted. We will now want to take a closer look for ourselves at the decisions which have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I regret to say that I cannot thank the Council on behalf of the Liberal Group for the work it has done during this period, because as I just said the results are far from satisfactory. However, I would like to thank Commissioner Gradin, who is unfortunately not here, and her officials, and I would like above all to call on the Council and the new Commission to make sure that the Tampere summit is a success.</p>

Schengen therefore remains one of our major concerns, both with regard to the freedom of movement of EU nationals and also with regard to freedom being indivisible for third country nationals who reside legally in one of the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I think that we could perhaps ask the Ministers in the Council to insist that France ceases to abuse derogating clauses, particularly with regard to border controls between Belgium and France. To come back to my main point, I think that the Schengen Executive Committee has therefore been replaced by the Council. The Council presidency, proud of its newfound glory, has defined, regulated and established legal bases. It has established terms of association in splendid isolation, without consulting, and sometimes without even informing, the people"s representatives, at least with regard to definitive texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this attitude. We are once again in the position of having to request, no, demand, that the Treaty be respected. It is high time that the new presidency conformed to this fresh request. It is high time that we had a clear definition of police and judicial cooperation, and that we knew precisely who does what and in what context.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission will have a lot of work to do in order to present a coherent plan at Tampere, and so that Schengen can bring about the area of freedom, security and justice that everyone desires.</p>

It is a well‐known fact that the People's Movement against the EU, which I represent, is opposed to the Schengen system, as I am myself, mainly for reasons of public security. I have no faith in claims that the construction of a supranational system of supervisory powers will benefit democracy in Europe. I presume that we all more or less wholeheartedly share the objective of establishing a humane refugee policy, but I take the view that democracy is best placed, as the Danes say, ‘in the pockets of the citizens". Schengen has been included in the Amsterdam Treaty and the opportunity has been taken to sneak Norway and Iceland into the system, whose people have voted against the European Union. By virtue of association agreements, they have something which in reality is equivalent to two thirds membership of the European Union without any influence. This is an absurdity. But now that the Schengen system has been created, I would far rather that it were kept under the third pillar, and for once I find myself in the situation of being able to praise the presidency for the exceptional lack of efficiency that is inherent in the administration of these rules. I would like to add that this Parliament is naturally interested in ensuring the maximum possible openness with regard to these decisions, a wish I fully support. The conduct of the Council in this respect leaves a great deal to be desired, whether the Treaty is interpreted one way or the other.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Andersson </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, may I begin by saying ‘well done" to the presidency. Schengen has now been successfully incorporated into the Treaty and we have a sensible balance between the first and third pillars. So the presidency certainly deserves our congratulations as far as the substance is concerned. Few people believed matters would be taken forward so fast.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is ample room for criticism with regard to the provision of information to the European Parliament and the inadequate use made of the expertise of this directly elected assembly. Clearly – as a previous speaker said – we need to distinguish between the formal and the political levels. Possibly the Council did in fact follow the existing consultation procedures. Probably this was the case, although we still need to cross‐check. On such important political items as the incorporation of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the signing of an association agreement with two very special countries, I still believe that Council should have consulted Parliament and taken on board its views. That is where I feel the ministers slipped up. They came along to the committee and we talked. But Parliament could have been consulted; the Council would then have been able to receive our opinions in the form of reports. That is where the Council has missed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to dwell further on issues connected with the first and third pillars; instead, let me concentrate on the association arrangements with Iceland and Norway. I was surprised to hear what the previous speaker had to say. I happen to know that he lives in Helsingør; I come from Helsingborg, four kilometres away. We both grew up on free movement. The benefits of such freedom, together with the existence of the Nordic passport union, have certainly had a marked influence on my life. I am delighted that we are now set to enjoy similar free movement with other countries too. The system has worked well for the Nordic area, and I am confident that it will work well for the European Union. And I am pleased that Norway and Iceland can also be associated in the agreement. It is somewhat rich that people should be criticising these two countries, when they are the ones behaving democratically and allowing their parliaments to decide. As far as I am aware, there will be a large parliamentary majority in favour – but no one"s hand is being forced. It is up to the democratic institutions to take the decision on whether to participate in this cooperation process. Once the procedures have been completed, I am sure that Norway and Iceland will make the necessary legislative adjustments to bring themselves in line with the system. There should be no major problem here, nor with the Joint Supervisory Authority. The countries concerned will be able to make their voice heard, even though they will not have any formal decision‐taking rights.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, since I came to this House in 1994, Parliament has been very clear about the fact that the future of the European Union is at stake here, in this area bordering the third pillar, in this area of rights and freedoms. Since I came to Parliament, we have worked hard to broaden the extremely narrow limits of Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty. And we must acknowledge that, without doubt, these limits have been transcended, not only by including many of the issues that used to be under the third pillar in the EC Treaty, in other words, in the first pillar, but also by way of the relative progress made with Article 39.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that Parliament has played an important role in these advances. I believe that we must highlight the good and bad aspects of this issue. And I believe that we must be consistent and faithful and exploit this principle of faithful cooperation between the institutions. As a result, we must acknowledge what the Council has done and particularly the German Presidency. I naturally appreciate the work involved in drawing up a list of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis, </span> as we all know that the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> was a web of rules and a web of international public law, which complicated matters even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the presentation of this document on the legal bases of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> , which I have still not had time to study in detail, is clearly important.</p>
<p class="contents">And together with the progress made, we must acknowledge and be aware of the difficulties inherent in integrating the Schengen Agreement into the framework of the European Union. It represents a closed world that is also being built beyond the limits of the European Union so that it can function. And we must also bear in mind that this is how it was born.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all this, Mr President, Parliament cannot remain motionless, for the reasons that have already been outlined. We have a duty to our people and it is extremely important where rights and freedoms are at stake. When the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union, we must clearly give our opinion. It is true that, legally speaking, we have no rights, and on some occasions, not within this House but in committee, some speakers have suggested that this be taken to the Court of Justice. We have no formal rights; we are not protected by the Treaty. Yet, politically speaking, there is no doubt that we must be here, we must be informed and we should have been consulted on these decisions. That was not the case. It is not enough for the German Presidency to merely tell us what they have tried to do, and this must be very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to mention two aspects that the German Presidency has agreed will come under the first pillar: the protection of personal data and the issuing of visas. You are all undoubtedly aware that we must be especially vigilant on these issues. We also hope that the initiatives being taken, particularly by the Commission, will outline some clear future guidelines that will allow us to make progress at the next summit in Tampere.</p>

However, we are still in the dark about the details. It seems that considerable sections of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> have been transferred to the first pillar, but the exact extent is difficult to determine at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is to blame for this lack of information, which is making it difficult for us to make any sort of assessment. The President‐in‐Office said that the Council had put in a lot of appearances here. This is true, we did see you quite often, but that is not the same thing as providing us with information or involving us in the decision making. None of that happened; despite what the presidency promised in March 1998, Parliament was not even kept informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament nevertheless has to do its duty and produce a legal and political assessment of the decisions the Council has now taken. I would like to ask you a few questions. What is the legal status of the section that has been transferred to the first pillar? Does it take the form of directives or regulations? We need to be clear about this if we are to avoid problems with any cases that may come before the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">It unfortunately seems that none of the problems with the Schengen information system have been resolved. It has been put under the third pillar temporarily, but how long is ‘temporary"? The lack of clarity on this point is extremely regrettable, because if we agree to it we will be landed with an entirely unwelcome responsibility. Who is to monitor the operation of the system? Who is to supervise it? The Commission or the Schengen Executive Committee?</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is something Mr Wiebenga also mentioned. A great deal of decisiveness is still needed and there is still a large amount of work to be done. Commissioner Monti is to come up with a new proposal on visas as soon as possible after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force. We are keenly awaiting an active asylum policy and the development of a series of instruments for determining violations of basic rights. The application of Article 286 of the Treaty is a good indicator here. Personal data are to be protected, along with the people to whom the data refer, naturally, and the European institutions are also going to have to comply with this.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are happy with this outcome, which is better than nothing. But there is still an incredible amount to be done, hopefully in cooperation with Parliament once it has been properly informed.</p>

As you know, we had to work right up to the last minute before managing to secure that agreement. We shall naturally continue our endeavours to reach an agreement on the place of the Schengen information system in the EU framework, but I am not very sure that this aim will be achieved before the end of the German Presidency. However, I should like to point out that, because of the automatic nature of the procedures laid down in the Schengen Protocol, the legal basis of the Schengen information system lies entirely within the third pillar. But this naturally means that the joint controlling body which has been monitoring compliance with the Schengen Agreement will continue to operate and will continue to ensure that data are being properly protected within the Schengen information system. As for certain provisions being assignable to the first pillar, Mrs d'Ancona, these are, of course, covered by individual provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and have thus become integral parts of the Treaty. This, to my mind, is one quite palpable result that has actually been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate in general terms that, for all the importance of the results that have now been achieved, the real political decision consisted in the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What has now taken place is the implementation of that decision. It is pleasing that this has been achieved with a fair degree of success.</p>
