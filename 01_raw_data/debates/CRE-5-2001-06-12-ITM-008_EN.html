<p class="contents">We have tabled an oral question on behalf of our group. The main reason for this is our group’s criticism of the way in which the Council used the procedure laid down in Article 133 as the basis for its decision to apply for the appointment of a panel to examine whether section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act is incompatible with the TRIPS Agreement. We did not deal to any great extent with the substance of the Council’s case, although the substantive argument did meet with some opposition and engendered lively discussion in committee; we chiefly focused on the expression of our desire to be fully informed in future and to be included in the decision-making structures used by the Council and the special committee established under Article 133. We believe this is especially necessary in the realm of trade policy. As all of you here – honourable Members, Commissioner and representative of the Council – are aware, when it comes to trade issues, we in Parliament are only involved to a limited extent. For many years we have been crossing swords on this issue – mainly with the Council and only to a lesser degree with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case in question, it is a matter of initiating proceedings to examine whether, in a dispute between Pernod/Ricard and Bacardi, a primarily Euro-Cuban holding and a primarily U.S.-European corporation, the EU is entitled to lend support as it sees fit. The Council has come down clearly on the side of Pernod/Ricard in this dispute, and the Commission supports this position too.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the committee did not pronounce ourselves on this dispute. All we said is that we should have wished to be informed before the institution of proceedings and before the appointment of the panel, so that we as a Parliament could have adopted a substantiated and well-founded position on the decision taken by the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that the Commission, especially Commissioner Lamy, has kept us regularly briefed. Accordingly, none of our criticism in this case has been directed at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the main point, and the reason why we attach so much importance to this issue, is that section 211 of the Trademark Act is one of those cases that relates to our long-running dispute with the United States over the Helms-Burton Act. It is about the extraterritorial application of domestic legislation. To that extent, we support the action taken by the Commission and the Council from a political point of view, but – as I have already mentioned – we do not condone the inadequate briefing of Parliament and its competent committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so important? You will have noticed that legislators on both sides of the Atlantic have been coming under increasing pressure to support the decisions of their respective governments. It is very, very important to us to make it clear to the other institutions that they will only be able to secure our support in future if they provide Parliament and the responsible parliamentary committee with comprehensive information.</p>
<p class="contents">You will see how necessary this is from the letter written by many Members of this House – I believe there were more than a hundred of us – and addressed to both the U.S. Government and the Council. The letter not only criticised the procedure adopted by the Council but also the substance of its decision. That is why I wish to make this urgent appeal to the Council to do everything possible in future to keep Parliament fully informed and to extend this obligation to cover any application for the institution of dispute-settlement proceedings, which means coming to the committee or the plenary chamber on such occasions and briefing Parliament in order to establish total transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Council are well aware of the desires regarding the procedure for decisions on the common trade policy which Parliament has formulated on several occasions. These desires have been examined and assessed very carefully. As we all know, they have also been the object of discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference which concluded its work in Nice on 7 – 9 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes to the text of the Treaty which this Intergovernmental Conference agreed on do <span class="italic">not </span>address this aspect of Article 133. It should also be noted that the vast majority of Member States did <span class="italic">not </span>consider it necessary to amend the article in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the obligations laid down in the Treaty, the Council requires openness. At meetings with the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in particular, the Council regularly informs Parliament of issues which are of importance to Community trade policy and in accordance with the Westerterp Procedure of 1973 the Council informs Parliament of negotiations concerning trade agreements with third countries before they are initiated, while they are underway and once negotiations have been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to note that Swedish Minister for Trade Leif Pagrotsky will hold two meetings with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy during the Swedish Presidency. Furthermore, representatives of the European Parliament were invited to the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Meeting on Trade on 29 May 2001. What is more, the chairman of the Article 133 Committee invited all members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to an informal meeting on 31 May 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schwaiger (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO dispute between the European Union and the United States in the Havana Club case, in other words the dispute regarding section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act, highlights the need for our Parliament to be informed and involved by the Council at crucial junctures in the pursuit of our common trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the Commission, the Council failed to take steps to inform Parliament fully and promptly of the formulation of a common position, as it ought to have done. The Council would normally apply Article 300(2) and the last sentence of Article 300(3), <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, and brief us on such important matters. The point is that the Council, by persisting with its current practice, is evading its parliamentary accountability to the Member States and to ourselves. This situation cannot be tolerated indefinitely, and we demand changes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present case, as Erika Mann has said, the absence of information from the Council has prompted a host of individual expressions of opinion in the European Parliament. Most of these, I believe, have been inconsistent with the prevailing view in the Committee on External Trade, and their cumulative effect has been to undermine seriously the Council position in Parliament. In other words, by failing to provide information, the Council has sown the seeds of uncertainty and has given our trading partners – in this case the United States – an opportunity, if not to weaken the position adopted by the Commission then certainly to present it as rather less clear-cut than it actually is.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that there is ultimately no alternative to a judicious change of procedure. In calling for change, we are merely exercising our parliamentary power of scrutiny. We are responsible as a Parliament for scrutinising the implementation of the common trade policy, and we should be better equipped in future to perform that function. Although the Commission keeps us informed, it is not enough for the Council, as it did through the Swedish Minister of Industry and Commerce, for example, to come to us and hold general discussions with us without involving us in consultation mechanisms such as the EU Trade Ministers’ informal talks. Under the Portuguese Presidency, for instance, we were invited to take part in these talks. I believe the Swedish Presidency still has a pledge to honour in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As spokesman for the PPE Group, I should like to reaffirm emphatically that we do approve of the way in which the Commission has acted on the provision of information as well as in defending the interests of the European Union against the United States in the dispute-settlement procedure, as has now been shown. The Council, however – as I have already said – failed to inform us about this common position, contrary to the undertaking given by Mr Pagrotsky.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the practical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council should show, through its actions as well as its words, that it accepts Parliament as an equal partner on issues of common trade policy, particularly by using the proper legal basis for all the measures with which it implements the common trade policy, in other words Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which is now applicable in conjunction with Article 3, as well as Article 300(2) and (3) – new numbering – the latter being applicable by analogy, given the necessary will to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council should enable the Commission to seek the opinion of Parliament prior to the conferment of a negotiating mandate, as in this Havana Club case, for example. We could then begin a dialogue and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. We also believe there is a need for an interinstitutional agreement on this matter, like the one we concluded with the Commission, until such times as the Treaty is finally amended too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must urge the Council, when it next revises the Treaty of Nice, which I hope it will do at the forthcoming Laeken summit, to reword Article 133 so as to involve the European Parliament in the framing of policy and the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on important trade issues. This proposal is contained in paragraph 28 of the Mendéz de Vigo and Seguro report on the conclusions to be drawn from the Treaty of Nice, and we shall insist on the earliest possible introduction of this amendment to the EC Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too believe – and I am speaking here on behalf of my group – that there is a need to redefine the obligations of the Council in terms of its accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know, of course, that the Council acted correctly in the purely formal sense – this was the honourable Member’s line of argument too – and that the Council is not under any formal obligation to consult Parliament. However, I do not believe we are talking about formal procedures here, but rather about proper substantive political cooperation. As far as proper cooperation is concerned, the Council is still falling far short of its duty to Parliament. My wish for the future is that the Council, instead of constantly invoking the formal position, will find an interinstitutional procedure that enables us to engage in some decent cooperation in future in the field of trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What you have seen this time will be seen more often in the future. But let us not be under any illusions: trade policy is becoming an ever wider field, and many issues go beyond trade policy and into the domain of international politics. These numerous trade disputes with the United States are a prime example. If you want Parliament to stand by you – and Parliament is with the Commission on the substantive issue, as Konrad Schwaiger said – you must ensure that we can cooperate properly on matters of substance. You must look on us as an adult partner, even if the Treaty does not yet formally recognise our adulthood.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the institutions have always found ways and means of cooperating in the past. I wish the Council would do likewise and find a new procedure. It may be that a discussion or briefing session would be held after each meeting of the special committee referred to in Article 133(3). Or, if the Council initiates official procedures, it could come to the parliamentary committee and explain the situation. I believe these would be ways of cooperating, and they would remove much of what I believe to be utterly unnecessary bitterness from the present debate. We largely agree on the substance of this issue. I also hope that many of the honourable Members who signed the letter have come to see that this was not the right course of action. May I therefore urge the Council most earnestly to venture forward, perhaps even today, and make the case for a new form of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, during the formal and informal debate on this issue over the last few weeks and months, both the Commission and the Council have indicated that it is not the business of the European Parliament to stick its nose into the substance of WTO cases. I broadly agree. The Council and the Commission have also indicated that they think it is none of the European Parliament's business to issue awkward declarations on issues which are basically <span class="italic">sub judice</span>. Again, under normal circumstances, I would agree. But I would ask the Council and the Commission to tell me what we are supposed to do when we ask both of them in committee several times for justifications of how and why the decision was taken to launch this highly sensitive case and we get no more than a mere technocratic response.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we supposed to do when we are told the decision was taken over lunch, not even by ministers, but over lunch in some obscure Council working group without any minutes to justify to the public or, indeed, to politicians such as ourselves, why the EU is launching yet another politically sensitive trade dispute?</p>
<p class="contents">What strikes me is the sheer naivety of both the Commission and the Council in tackling such a highly political issue as if it were nothing more than a technical decision. It is simply inconceivable that the US Administration in Washington would rush headlong into yet another trade dispute with the EU without first ensuring there is a minimum of political backing in Congress. I find it very striking that both the Commission and the Council have failed to do that this time.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested that those who have signed this hotly worded declaration were behaving irresponsibly. Some Members of this Parliament feel it was irresponsible. It is surely much more irresponsible to launch such a politically and commercially sensitive trade dispute without even a ritual nod towards the normal standards of transparency and political probity. It is not an issue of reforming Article 133. It is simply expecting both the Commission and the Council to conduct trade policy, particularly on politically sensitive issues, in a more transparent and politically intelligent manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to focus on the wider issue of democracy and accountability more generally.</p>
<p class="contents">This specific case demonstrates precisely the absence of democratic accountability in EU trade policy. That is a huge indictment of the largest trading block in the world which prides itself on standing up for those very values. The Nice Treaty could have been an opportunity to begin to improve the democracy and transparency of EU trade policy but in fact the Treaty makes these matters worse by increasing the powers of the Commission but not balancing that by increasing the powers of Parliament via the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile at Council level the 133 Committee meets behind closed doors. As parliamentarians we are not even allowed as observers much less as participants. We receive no minutes of these meetings. There is no formal dialogue between us. We thank you for the informal receptions which are very nice but they are no real substitute for a formal dialogue. Furthermore in spite of all the rhetoric about trade policy supporting sustainable development, when you look at who attends the 133 meetings, it is usually simply the representatives from the trade and finance ministries alone. But if we are serious about integrating international trade and sustainable development, then the very minimum we need to do is to ensure that representatives from social affairs, from environment, from development ministries have their voices heard at 133 meetings as well.</p>
<p class="contents">If sustainability really is a key issue for the EU and if the Swedish Presidency is really serious about openness, could the Presidency tell us if first of all it envisages a formalised dialogue between Parliament and the 133 Committee, and secondly if it is ready to propose revisions to the composition of that committee. Ultimately, in order to make it more likely that trade policy enjoys the support of both parliamentarians and the wider public, Parliament should in the longer term have codecision powers, not only on the final outcome of any new trade agreement but also crucially on the Commission's mandate for negotiations. The EU says it is committed to reforming the World Trade Organisation but a first place to start would be to reform the decision-making machinery of the EU itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we have to accept that certain decisions of the past require revision. The European Parliament is responsible for monitoring the common trade policy. We have co-decision rights on matters relating to the single market. But on important international trade issues, the Union is not such a model of democratic transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Sweden, which is itself a model of transparency, is called upon as the present incumbent of the presidency to take us another step along this road. It is quite simply imperative to guarantee an open and transparent decision-making process on the basis of Article 133.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the European Union, after enlargement and the forthcoming final stage of the switch to the euro, will be the world’s foremost trading bloc by a considerable margin. In the United States, it is apparent that cooperation between the Government, the President and Congress actually works very well and that information flows freely between them. Cooperation between the Council and the Commission is very good at the present time; Mr Lamy must be complimented for this. I do wish, however, that the Council would also take joint initiatives with the European Parliament on the international stage, because these issues are of the utmost importance to our future. One day, when our membership has risen from 15 to a greater number of States, our clout will increase, and I believe that the link with the roots of the Union’s legitimacy in its Member States is an essential democratic requirement. If we want to develop a global market for our goods, such an effort will ultimately affect all of us. In other words, we must stand shoulder to shoulder as equal partners and strive for success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the discussion here in the Chamber, I have identified two distinct trends. The first trend, represented by Mr Schwaiger among others, would require us to change the procedure. I assume that Mr Schwaiger considers that we must change the rules. Mr Clegg, on the other hand, who represents the second trend, says that the issue is not primarily about Article 133 but about the Council’s desire for openness in general.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can see no other way of addressing this issue than actually working on the basis of what is laid down in the Treaty and Article 133. As we live in a society based on the rule of law, we can do nothing other than proceed on the basis of what is said in the Treaty. Of course, some might think that this should possibly have been changed. I therefore reported on a little of the discussion surrounding the amendments to the text of the Treaty which took place in Nice, and there will of course be an opportunity to return to this question. We have an Intergovernmental Conference coming up in 2004. Mr Schwaiger hopes to see changes as early as in Laeken. This might be a little optimistic but, as I have stated, there will be an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. Let us return to the discussion then.</p>
<p class="contents">So what opportunities do we have if we cannot achieve progress along formal lines? Has the Council done enough to proceed along informal paths, keep Parliament up to date and give Parliament an opportunity to take part in the discussion? Naturally, openness and consultation can always be improved, but it is with a certain amount of regret that I note that, on two occasions during the Swedish Presidency when we invited dialogue on the issues I mentioned earlier, no-one attended from Parliament. There is an English expression “it takes two to tango”, and this also applies in this context. The Council has demonstrated that we want dialogue. Unfortunately, it appears that there was insufficient interest on the part of Parliament and on the part of the representatives of the committees concerned in taking part in such a dialogue. I can only regret this. It only gives us cause to maintain this dialogue to ensure that we obtain a consultation procedure which respects what is set out in the Treaty. Otherwise, we will seek the informal paths which are open to us in order to obtain the democratic support we all desire on these important issues of trade policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as procedure is concerned, I would remind you that the decision to launch a procedure of this type at the WTO forms part of the executive responsibility of the Commission. We took this decision while fully complying with the rules set out in the Treaty, which are what they are unless and until they are changed. The Commission, as you know, would like to change them, but the Council has decided otherwise and up to now, when it comes to amending the Treaty, it is the governments of the Member States who take the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore observed the procedures entirely correctly. The 133 Committee, the consultative body of the Council, gave its support to the launching of this procedure in March, and it confirmed its position in June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Mann and Mr Schwaiger have said, numerous discussions have taken place between the Commission and its staff and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the question of this WTO case. I myself have responded to oral and written questions which have been raised by the Members of this House. I have also met some Members in person in order to discuss the subject with them.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make things quite clear and to add my own opinion to this debate, I would remind you, in case anyone needs reminding, that it was not a question of taking sides in favour of such and such a business, or in somebody’s individual interests, whether that would have been legitimate or not, but rather of assessing, from the point of view of the interests of the Union in general, the compliance of the American law on trade marks with the WTO Code.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believed, and I said so at the time before the Committee on Industry, that a parallel intervention by Members of Parliament in a WTO procedure seemed to me to be rather strange, even inappropriate, and I said at the time, and I shall say it to you again now, that I believe that a proper exchange of information between us should have the effect of avoiding any repetition of this type of incident in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, let me express my thanks to the Swedish Presidency for the recent invitation from the Swedish Ambassador in Brussels to informal talks with the members of the ‘Article 133’ Committee. This, however, was a cocktail party, not a meeting, and I pointed out to several people, including the chairman of the ambassadors’ group, that it was perhaps not an ideal arrangement to hold the event on a Thursday evening, when the Members of Parliament were returning to their constituencies at the end of a plenary week. But these things can be rectified, and another weekday could be chosen next time. That is the first point. Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you said that things will have to be changed – not now but in 2004. But please remember, Mr Danielsson, that we now have a round of international trade negotiations in Qatar, and we have a ministerial meeting at which the U.S. Congress will be represented. The U.S. Congress, however, has not yet approved the ‘fast track’ proposal. This means that the U.S. Congress currently has direct participatory powers in Qatar. We in the European Parliament are no longer receiving sufficient information from you. Compare your conduct, the conduct of the Swedish Presidency, with that of the members of the U.S. Administration, who now speak to the Members of Congress virtually on a daily basis, week in, week out.</p>

I am in the same boat as my fellow Members, in that I was only informed of one of the meetings to which the Council presidency invited us. We were, of course, delighted to receive the invitation. But it was indeed a cocktail party on Thursday afternoon, with all the attendant difficulties. When I arrived, the door was already closed. There was something I had to discuss beforehand and could not make it for the start of the gathering. It would be very good of you, Mr Danielsson, to make a proposal next time for a better arrangement that would enable all of us to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second meeting you mentioned, I should be grateful if you would remind us which meeting that was. I know nothing about any other meeting. Konrad Schwaiger did not refer to it, presumably because he knows nothing about it either. Would you perhaps be so kind as to tell us which meeting it was that you invited our committee to attend?</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point on which I am at one with my fellow Members, and I know that this is not a question but a brief comment: I wish you would truly regard this Parliament as a heavyweight in the political ring and treat it accordingly. We fully understand that we do not yet have the means or the right to demand such treatment, but I believe you can regard us from a political point of view as an equal partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
