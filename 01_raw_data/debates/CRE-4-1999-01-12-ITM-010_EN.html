<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sisó Cruellas </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Danesin, cannot be with us for this debate, I have the honour of replacing him to present the contents of his report, and I would like to begin by thanking him for the excellent work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to a lack of time, I will merely highlight certain aspects of the motion for a resolution on the Commission"s communication on public‐private partnerships in trans‐European transport network projects. The Committee on Transport and Tourism was almost unanimous in approving this motion for a resolution, as there was only one abstention and no votes against.</p>
<p class="contents">If we read the Commission"s communication on public‐private partnerships in trans‐European transport network projects carefully and assess the actual problems that were ultimately what prompted this communication, we can determine the key issues involved. These include the inadequacies of the long‐term European capital markets – which are crucial for the risk management of investments with extended maturities – the lack of advanced projects, particularly for Central and Eastern Europe, and the private sector"s lack of trust and uncertainty with respect to the public sector"s current and future actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the public‐private partnerships have many complicated problems to solve, and, indeed, they may not be capable of solving them. According to the motion for a resolution, these partnerships have to meet certain conditions. They must respect the necessary equilibrium between commercial and socio‐economic criteria in project planning. They must divide the risks so that the private sector ensures that it is able to meet the commitments entered into in such a partnership, thus preventing the public sector from having to provide additional funding to ensure the completion of the project. In addition, each partnership must be analysed individually, with the analysis always including a cost/benefit comparison with a purely publicly financed alternative in terms of profitability and social consequences. Finally, there should be no impact on public deficits in cases where no actual payments take place between the government and private investors.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution also points out that the allocation of public resources has a vital role to play and it therefore calls on the Member States to devote at least 1.5 % of their budget resources to transport networks. For its part, the European Parliament undertakes, within its sphere of competence, to make all possible efforts to ensure a higher level of funding for the Community budget headings relating to the networks. It also calls on the Member States and on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that the legislation on public contracts applicable to infrastructure projects is both clear and flexible in order to guarantee the involvement of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it calls on the Member States and the Commission to ensure adequate transparency and public participation in the planning process relating to publicly/privately supported projects.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main aspects I would highlight in this motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would end by calling on the House to vote in favour of this report, since the public‐private partnerships in trans‐European transport network projects can make a very positive contribution to adapting or mobilising the participation of private capital, which, in my view, is essential. If this does not happen, it will be very difficult to adhere to current construction plans for transport infrastructures. This, in turn, would lead to a significant reversal in the growth forecasts for our economies, our economic and social development and the competitiveness of the European economy.</p>

The report was adopted unanimously by the committee after detailed discussions among the individual Members and the groups. So you see that, for all the issues that may be discussed today and tomorrow in this Chamber, there is still a constructive and cooperative working atmosphere in the specialised committees. My sincere thanks go to my colleagues for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report, we have delivered an opinion on the Green Paper of December 1997. We have been relatively quick and have tried to incorporate all the information we obtained from the port operators and the trade unions. So we did not attempt to confine our deliberations and our labours on the Green Paper within an ivory tower. Together with the Commission, we reached the conclusion – and this was not always the view in port circles – that there ought to be an effective European policy on sea ports, albeit limited in scope in deference to the solidarity principle. That had been disputed for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">As we see it, this European sea ports policy has two primary objectives. The first is to establish fair competition at long last among the European sea ports. There is still no escaping the conclusion that competition among sea ports is distorted by regional and national aid, and that is simply in total contradiction to the principles underlying the single European market.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second objective, we are entirely convinced that the interests of sustainable mobility would be best served if the Community's supply lines did not converge on a small number of major ports but if a thoroughly decentralised system were used with numerous peripheral ports, thereby avoiding a great many overland transport operations and making the transport system easier on the environment. This would naturally imply the need to promote the development of some of the smaller ports or the creation of new ports, but that too must be governed by the precept of non‐interference with fair competition among the sea ports.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the concrete implications of these two objectives in terms of what we are asking the Commission to do? First of all, the Commission should at long last present a transparency study on the conditions of competition between and within sea ports. I have already said that national and regional aid distorts competition. But it also handicaps those ports and companies which have become more efficient through their own efforts and want to remain effective. Steps must be taken to ensure that efficiency cannot be undermined by illegal subsidies, but the relevant facts must be on the table. You have a host of facts, but you have not collated these facts and presented them to us. That is our first priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, irrespective of the transparency study, the Commission is already required to impose penalties for the violation of competition law and to investigate suspected infringements. You should do that more often. You know a great deal, but it is our view that we need guidelines on aid to sea ports and on verifying compliance with competition law if all ports and port companies are to be treated fairly, and we need those guidelines before 2001, which is the date suggested in a paper from your institution, Commissioner. In actual fact, we should have had them five years ago. We need clear guidelines so that, when it comes to certain practices which have become established in one or other of the Member States, it can be made clear that the practice in question has to stop. The system must be changed. We need fair competition. The ports and companies will have to learn to live with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential aspect of these guidelines is that the funding of infrastructure facilities in the realm of port operations and maritime transport must be subdivided into three categories: public ports, where infrastructural measures need not be notified or checked because they do not constitute state aid; company‐related measures in the domain of port infrastructure, which constitute state aid unless they are refinanced and therefore do not possess the characteristics of aid, otherwise they are subject to aid legislation; company‐related measures in the domain of port superstructure, on the other hand, are always subject to aid legislation in our view, in other words they are essentially inadmissible. I shall not go into the question of exceptions here.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me make this appeal to the Commission: create transparency, take action against offenders, but do not create new legislation, Commissioner. Our committee takes the view that, at least for the time being, there is no need for either a directive on port‐related infrastructure, fees or terminals, or a directive on market access for providers of port services. I can assure you that Dutch tugs have penetrated the Hamburg market, and tugs from Hamburg are achieving the breakthrough in Antwerp. It will work without new legislation if the Commission supports the market forces. That is why we ask the Commission to carry on working with the current legislation. Spare yourselves the trouble of making new laws, and operate instead with the existing legislation on state aid and competition; protect the ports that are progressing by their own efforts, and let us cooperate in supporting the others, but the paramount aim must be to preserve a level playing field.</p>

<p class="contents">The global navigation satellite system, GNSS, enables us to meet the increasingly high demands for up‐to‐date information on locations and times in our daily work and leisure. It offers ever greater efficiency within the transport infrastructure, while enhancing safety and reducing environmental pollution. In short, with a European GNSS we shall be able to create a more efficient and environmentally friendly general transport system in Europe. If I may cite a few examples, satellite‐guided air traffic control will make the work of flight controllers easier, thereby ensuring greater passenger safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In the realm of road transport, the loads and locations of heavy goods vehicles will be accurately identifiable at any time, which will allow more precise planning of distribution operations. Perhaps the best‐known application of satellite‐based navigation technology is in the area of shipping and fisheries, where it was initially boycotted but then used as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as leisure activities are concerned, a growing number of amateur sailors have equipped their yachts with satellite‐based navigation technology. The number of potential new applications appears to be infinite. Imagine the thoroughly conceivable scenario that amateur mountaineers too will become dependent on satellite navigation systems in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So when we speak of GNSS, we are not talking about a technological breakthrough that will benefit only a few people, but rather of a new mass market.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, two satellite navigation systems are available for use – the American GPS and the Russian GLONASS. Both of these systems, however, have distinct disadvantages as far as we Europeans are concerned. Both are state‐controlled and are designed for military purposes. The Americans make a point of restricting the availability of their system for civilian use, which makes it far from ideal for European users. This manifests itself in a lack of accuracy, combined with an excessively high risk of technical failure and unduly long waiting times in the event of the system breaking down, as has already happened.</p>
<p class="contents">This means there is no guarantee that the system will always be available. By becoming users of the American GPS, we are therefore making ourselves highly dependent on the Americans and on their willingness to provide us with more or less comprehensive signal transmission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, worldwide satellite‐based communication networks will be established. These represent an enormous growth potential for European space research, and they also give Europe the opportunity to prove itself in global competition and to challenge the dominant suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">We can even establish a leading position here. So GMSS really does have enormous market potential, and Europe can perhaps provide the world's first civilian supplier in this segment of the market. The first step in this direction has just been taken with the conclusion of a convention which lays down the ground rules for close cooperation between the three European institutions in this field – the Commission, the European Space Agency – ESA – and the European air safety organisation Eurocontrol.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy of the EU is based on a two‐stage approach. In the first stage, the aforementioned signals will be used as a basis, but their accuracy and integrity will be improved by means of additional ground‐ and space‐based infrastructure that already exists. The second stage will then see the creation of an independent European system for civilian use or – and this is my own preferred option – a system of international cooperation with the same objective.<br />European industry will secure a broad operational base on which it can develop a variety of applications of this new technology in an innovative and constantly expanding global market. This will also result in new jobs in research, development, equipment and services. The two‐stage model will pave the way towards this new market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one problem, which is the question of funding. The public sector will not bear the entire cost of such a system, and so there is a need for some logical and detailed propositions. We need only think of what Mr Sisó has just been saying about the public‐private partnership model, which will surely have to be a feature of the funding formula.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, to address all the players in politics, industry and research establishments, when you develop the satellite navigation system for Europe, you should create equal access to all potential applications of this innovative basic technology, which is here to stay.</p>

The first attempt to mobilise private capital to finance the trans‐European networks, it has to be said, was an abject failure. It failed for want of appeal and because of administrative, legal and indeed political obstacles. It was argued at the time that such projects were desirable and necessary, and that the accelerated development of trans‐European transport projects was the absolute climax of the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">These projects, of course, were also welcomed for their benefits in terms of employment. But there has been no progress in that direction either. Today I should like to cite another reason for forging ahead with the development of the trans‐European transport networks at this particular time, namely their necessity in the light of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to take some account of the growth rates in the applicant countries, it is absolutely essential to press on with transport projects, even if only for environmental reasons, because otherwise the environmental problems will go spiralling out of our control at the very heart of Europe. Closer coordination between the European Investment Bank and the European Development Fund and long‐term sources of funding, including risk capital, are necessary to make public‐private partnerships more appealing the second time round. In addition, it is necessary to improve the interaction and demarcation between the private and public sectors and to take better account of each partner's needs. That, along with a greater injection of public funds, is the only way we can start work tomorrow on the projects that we already need urgently today.</p>

Hence the obvious need to adopt the appropriate policies, designed in particular to preserve the competitiveness of the EU maritime sector, which accounts for 2.5 million jobs, and to safeguard the prospects for cooperation with the applicant countries and the Union's Mediterranean neighbours, which also represent a major challenge for the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential precondition is to apply policies to remove the existing imbalance between southern and northern ports; there is no sign of this, however, in the Green Paper's strategy. The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, which I have the privilege of chairing, considers that the aim should be to recover the costs incurred in providing port services, while the infrastructures should be financed from the revenue generated by port activities. Self‐financing is essential if ports' accounts are to be transparent; this is a precondition for free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth RTD framework programme deals with the question of ports, maritime infrastructure and marine technologies, devoting particular attention to sustainable mobility, intermodality and research into sustainable marine ecosystems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Research Committee supports the Council of Europe's proposal for the creation of a European Maritime Agency, which would be responsible for encouraging cooperation between centres of excellence in Europe, the European maritime industry and the relevant political decision‐making bodies; the cooperation model employed could be along the lines of Eureka.</p>

I should also like to stress the importance of integrated and multimodal transport. I am pleased that the exclusive interest in road transport is progressively being replaced by other priorities. I would also mention the importance of ports as a connection for Europe"s less developed regions and also emphasise the great geographical diversity. The report does indeed refer to the difficult position of certain insular locations, but I would also point out that some major sea ports are located inland. I live close to Antwerp, so you will understand what I mean. It requires dredging operations costing 8 billion a year to keep the port open and it would be a disaster for this sea port"s competitive position if the cost of this dredging had to be passed on to the user. You will understand that we are looking at the specific measures that will result from the implementation of your policy. Unlike major southern European and Norwegian and British ports, our ports cannot make use of ERDF aid and the Cohesion Fund. I hope the Commission will see fit to take account of this geographical position. I am also very pleased that you intend to implement an integrated town and country planning policy, as our ports are very greedy when it comes to space. I should like to take this opportunity to express my solidarity, here in the House, with a small village in my neighbourhood, by the name of Doel, which is condemned to disappear due to Antwerp"s expansion.</p>

It is a complex issue because of its very technical nature, but the system is also an eminently political issue in that the independence of Europe in the field of air traffic control is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">The GNSS is a prime example of complementarity between the European Commission and the European Space Agency involving Eurocontrol, which also applies to the EGNOS programme. This being the case, I will underscore three points voted for by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, and which I, as draftsman of its opinion, have tabled as amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must emphasise the need to promote, by means of the fifth framework programme of research, the basic research and technological demonstrations required to develop high performance satellites that are adapted to the needs of navigation and positioning, and also the need to improve ground installations and in particular on‐board equipment on the different vessels, aircraft and land vehicles. In fact, the GNSS world market is in the order of EUR 40 billion, of which satellites represent 10 million and ground installations and on‐board equipment represent 30 million. The improvement and in particular the safety of air traffic is one of the challenges of the European GNSS but we must also aim to improve the management of sea and land traffic and also of road and rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to extend the use of the GNSS to other applications such as those mentioned by the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, and in particular for sea rescue. In this context, it is essential to identify correctly the location of the ground installations and, in particular, to ensure that they marry up to airport installations and sea and land transport communications centres. Europe will thus have not only a satellite navigation and positioning system but also the means to use it to improve air, land and sea traffic, which is the ultimate aim of the European GNSS.</p>

Indeed, that is where I should like to begin: the Green Paper on sea ports and maritime infrastructure has aroused great expectations, not least because for the first time ports are recognised as an integral part of the trans‐European network system. Yet it has aroused some concern among port operators concerning the funding of port infrastructure, in that full account does not appear to have been taken of the difference in circumstances between Europe's northern and southern ports.</p>
<p class="contents">After a long period of stagnation, traffic in the Mediterranean has experienced its fastest growth ever over the past ten years, as a result of the increase in international traffic via the Suez route and in local traffic, including that of passengers. Growth rates in double figures have been recorded, and many ports have at last become more business‐oriented, organising themselves in a more up‐to‐date, competitive fashion. Nevertheless, in the main the infrastructure is still inadequate to cope with this growth.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the nature of institutional and administrative cooperation between port authorities and local administrations still differs considerably from one sea port to another in the various regions of Europe. For this reason, Mr Jarzembowski quite rightly recommends in his excellent report that the Commission should carry out a fact‐finding study on the different types of sea port in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress two further points here. The rules on fair competition among sea ports should not allow for exemptions and should, if anything, favour those which have made the transition to private undertakings rather than those still operating as state enterprises. My second point relates to maritime passenger transport which, especially in the Mediterranean, is of crucial importance as a factor of economic, social and regional growth. The expansion of sea port infrastructure in the Mediterranean must be encouraged, including in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on now to satellite navigation, as spokesman of the Committee on External Economic Relations I would add a few comments on the excellent report by Mrs Langenhagen. Europe is clearly embarking here on a strategy with tremendous potential; it is not too complex technologically, nor is it disproportionate to Europe's resources and ambitions. In short, it is within our means. Furthermore, this venture would symbolise the use of technology for safety and efficiency purposes, and could make European cooperation more visible to our citizens. The time has therefore come to press ahead with the decisions and investment needed for a European satellite navigation system. I believe that the Research Committee has done its work on the fifth framework programme; it is now up to Mr Kinnock to propose a method of funding the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as international negotiations are concerned, clearly the United States still regard the GPS as having dual use, civil and military. I would therefore say – somewhat paradoxically – that it is in the interest of the US, as well as Europe, for Europe to take its own initiative concerning a new constellation of regional and global satellites. Of course we wish for interoperability with the American system, that is obvious; let us also foster cooperation with Japan and with the countries where the space sector is taking off, such as China and India. It would likewise be worthwhile to continue cooperating with Russia, despite the risk that their system may be unreliable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a European entity needs to be established to certify satellite data protocols. This too should be given due consideration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Castricum </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, last week I heard a story on the radio about a transport firm which did a trial run by sending a container by train from the south of the Netherlands to Cadiz and was notified five and a half days later that its consignment had arrived in Spain. I could not help thinking of this when I was looking through the Green Paper on sea ports and maritime infrastructure again and was struck by the second rule. Europe"s competitiveness in the global economy is increasingly dependent on an efficient and profitable transport system. This is something that we need to bear in mind now more than ever before when dossiers come before our committee. There is a lot of competition between ports. The Green Paper – and not a day too soon – calls for a system that is in line with the rules which apply to many other sectors. This is all the more necessary as port complexes have increasingly developed into areas where many different kinds of transport, industry, commerce and often other valuable services are concentrated. Unfortunately, I am not able to go into the most important elements of the Green Paper in any depth at this point. I congratulate the Commission for the thorough job it has endeavoured to do and my colleague Mr Jarzembowski for the results of his diligent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the Green Paper was published at the end of 1997. Since then we have clocked up another two years, which is another way of looking at it, Mr Jarzembowski. You opted for a somewhat different approach, but we have clocked up another two years since then. Although I have no doubt that the Commission will accept Mr Jarzembowski"s report, soon to be approved by Parliament, we must assume that, given the passage of time, the Commission has progressed with the necessary work. The first but decisive step is to gather the necessary information. Reliable and comparable information. I would appreciate it if the Commission could inform us this evening what progress has been made in this area, as I understand that detailed questionnaires have been sent out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, various groups have submitted amendments. The fact that there are not very many further underlines what we have known since we looked at the report in the committee, namely that there is broad support for Mr Jarzembowski"s report. We therefore have no need to support the new amendments. But I should like to put one question to the Commissioner in connection with Amendment No 8 tabled by Mr Lagendijk. Could the Commissioner review the scope for promoting genuine cooperation between ports, while respecting the subsidiarity principle, as in my decided opinion this would also benefit the competitiveness of Europe"s economy in the world.</p>

<p class="contents">It is very clear that the development of trans‐European transport networks is crucial for economic growth, socio‐economic cohesion and the competitiveness of the European economy, and we are all very aware of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also very clear that, in order to build such infrastructures, we need substantial investment. Given the current budgetary constraints, it is impossible for the Member States to finance such projects. The participation of private capital is therefore essential. That is why the public‐private partnerships proposed by the Commission may be a valuable way of ensuring the funding required to implement trans‐European transport networks and allow them to become operational.</p>
<p class="contents">This will only be possible when potential investors and construction companies, along with transport service providers and the capital goods sector, are offered a stable framework for their financial transactions. This stability will naturally also be dependent on governments and partner countries accepting their responsibilities, thereby creating a clear political and legal framework that enables investors to recognise the political and administrative risks involved in the projects. It would mean, too, that the European Union"s rules on competition, the environment and public procurement were being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, and in spite of a general sense of goodwill, it seems as though the various agents involved are not having a great deal of success in initiating the involvement of private capital in the construction of transport infrastructures. To overcome the present difficulties and bring together the resources needed to create the transport infrastructure network, we need greater efforts on the part of all Europe"s financial institutions, both public and private, and on the part of the various economic and social agents concerned. This network is essential to achieve the objectives the European Union has set itself, which include the construction of a trans‐European network of infrastructures that will promote the successful enlargement of the European Union, and the opening‐up of the pan‐European transport system to the countries of Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>

The sea ports are naturally the most important intersections in these networks. Not only the most important intersections in fact, but also by definition points where intermodal transport takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the Commission"s view that short sea shipping‐ must be encouraged. I should now like to put a specific question to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN) Mr Commissioner, would you please reply to this specific question: if subsidies are not allowed for infrastructure because they do not fall within the public domain would there then not be another possibility, because intermodal installations are eligible for subsidies. So you could always turn around the argument and say no, this is not infrastructure for private use, this is intermodal.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) Mr President, I shall now revert to my mother tongue and must again make it clear that we need to abolish subsidies and increasingly move to normal market mechanisms. Consequently, the sort of idea proposed by Mr Castricum that ports should work together is utter nonsense. Ports are general companies and you cannot tell them to have one kind of transport in one port and another kind of transport in another. Ports compete with one another and we must allow the market to do its work. Perhaps the cooperation between socialists and liberals which we have had for so long in my country can convince Mr Castricum of this.</span></p>

<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission"s Green Paper has been eagerly awaited by professionals in the sector, who quite legitimately hoped that it would generate development prospects. However, the response to these expectations, as described in the Commission document, is a long way from living up to the hopes they had inspired.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot help but note that this document does not correspond to the objectives set initially. We must regret in particular the limited view which the Commission has of the role and importance to be given to sea ports. In fact, to my mind, ports do not merely have a commercial role but are also tools for developing employment and regional planning. In this capacity, they must be able to continue to receive a certain degree of backing from public authorities. We thought that the inadequacies and gaps in the Commission"s proposals would be noted by the rapporteur and that certain points in the Green Paper could usefully be improved upon when examined in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We ourselves had made a number of proposals to promote a new dynamism for Europe"s ports. However, none of our proposals was included either in the Commission text or in Mr Jarzembowski"s report. For this reason I am sorry to say – and Mr Jarzembowski must forgive me – that we find the present report no more satisfactory than the Commission text. Both documents have an excessively restrictive view of sea ports. Certainly, these have a commercial purpose but I must stress that they also play a fundamental role in terms of regional planning and have a certain impact on employment. The absence of references to the necessary public service obligations assigned to port authorities is regrettable.</p>

This sector plays an important role in employment, economic development and regional planning; it cannot therefore be considered solely in commercial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We approve of the fact that Mr Jarzembowski"s report rejects the idea of adopting directives on infrastructure charges and on port fees and for the moment sees no need for Community legislation on organisational structure and market access for port services, given the current diverse situations. This position is also in line with that of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">While we also appreciate the progress made in committee, we must note that the report, like the Commission proposals, relies too much on reasoning that is based exclusively on the market. This reasoning leads the Commission to propose, as in other sectors, a process of port liberalisation, and thus aims to restrict financial aid. The public service tasks performed by these structures are highly underestimated and must be given greater consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group"s amendments aim to affirm that port activities serve the general interest and, as a result, refuse to ban the aid needed to achieve these tasks. Such decisions must remain a matter for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that it would be useful, on the other hand, to draw up a Community framework for professional qualifications and respect for safety requirements in order to fight effectively against distortions of competition and to promote social harmonisation from above.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, despite a certain degree of progress, this report in its current form does not in our opinion meet this sector"s development needs.</p>

I would add that, as Greens, we maintain that proper use of marine and inland waterways forms an integral part of a sustainable transport system. For this very reason, however, we consider it important that some aspects which the Commission has to a certain extent endorsed should appear not only in the recitals but also in the body of the text. We Greens have therefore put forward an amendment asserting more forcefully the need for strategic environmental impact assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the creation of new sea port infrastructure, we believe that account should be taken of existing capacity and, above all, of cooperation between sea ports.

They argue over which can call itself the biggest, or whether the financial state of affairs in Europe"s fiercely competitive ports is according to the rule book. The great differences in structure between the ports is to blame here. I would stress that ports grow up in a particular culture and are characterised by this. This is why verifiable regulations must take account of this diversity. It is not a good thing if ports inside Europe are given unequal treatment. In order to correct this discrepancy, it is first necessary to conduct a thorough inquiry into the financial structure of Europe"s ports. In addition to this there must also be guidelines for identifying any improper aid, which must be clear and unambiguous in every respect. That is why I have tabled two amendments on this point that should enable the classification of financial flows to be considered on the basis of clear and simple criteria. Irrespective of whether ports are legally granted state aid, the area of tension between state aid and fair competition needs to be more clearly defined. Excessive subsidies going to competing ports cannot be allowed to destroy everything a port has built up over many decades with major investment. We must remain very vigilant about this. On the other hand it is desirable to take measures to stimulate coastal transport. On many previous occasions Parliament has expressed the view that more transport should be by means which place the least burden on the environment. For this reason I should like to see more investment in our ports in order to encourage a shift in the modal split in this direction.</p>

The development of transport TENs is obviously a key element in the process of European unification. In my opinion, mobility – especially within the single market area – is crucial not only in economic but also in cultural terms, so as to promote trade, competitiveness, communication and overall social development. As the report makes clear, however, these projects require substantial financial resources and a considerable economic commitment, and the Member States' current difficulties in supporting such ventures through public funding are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">This report therefore proposes that use be made of joint public‐private partnerships to create the trans‐European transport networks. We share this view; we also share the concern of the rapporteur, Mr Danesin, that, on the one hand, private operators should be assured of profitability – obviously, if there is no profit there will be no private investment – but that, on the other, the infrastructure created shouldt be socially beneficial. Hence the need to share out the entrepreneurial risk, taking account both of commercial and of social and environmental criteria, as part of an overall strategy for mobility within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore endorse the report's concluding proposals. Finally, I hope that the Commission will not merely offer long‐term credit arrangements, but will also take more active steps to attract substantial private investment.</p>

In some respects we have been rather slow off the mark in this area, but we realise that this development has considerable potential, not only for navigation but also for safety, and that it offers major opportunities in terms of urban and non‐urban traffic management. Every effort must be made to ensure that this network is interoperable, building on the intelligent transport system currently being developed in a systematic manner within the Community, which has already had a significant impact in the EU's most built‐up areas: Turin, Hamburg and London have all experimented with intelligent transport systems. The navigation network represents a step forward, and the cooperation between the European Space Agency, Euratom, the IMO and the ICAO underlines the value of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that this approach should be regarded not merely as being dependent on the wishes of the Commission and the EU institutions; a significant input of both public and private resources is also required. I would point out here, for example, that in Italy the Prime Minister has established an ad hoc group on satellite navigation systems, thus attributing great importance to this sector. Moreover, with reference to the likely impact of the positioning and navigation system, investment should not be restricted to positioning alone; investment and experimentation should also be furthered by boosting the role of SMEs, providers and all bodies capable of making a valid contribution to disseminating this advanced technological system.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now make two observations concerning the Green Paper on sea ports. There is a need for competition in this field; we need to find out all the facts, yet we must not forget that investment required in strategic sectors – the environment, combined transport and so on – is enormous. Of course we should not confuse investment with subsidies, as Mr van Dam rightly said, but we must bear in mind that Structural Fund resources are vital to economic cohesion in Europe. In this light, Structural Fund resources cannot be regarded as unfair competition.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McIntosh </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome all three reports and the high level of support from all political groups within the Committee on Transport and Tourism attained by those reports. I should like to concentrate on the Danesin report so eloquently moved this evening by my colleague, Mr Sisó Cruellas, and on the Commission communication on public‐private partnerships in trans‐European transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Trans‐European networks have a crucial role to play in achieving and operating the single market and assisting European businesses to speedier access to that market for their goods and services. I would like this evening to unreservedly support and encourage partnership between public and private sectors in this field. Through you, Mr President, I would like to make a plea to the Commissioner this evening to look closely at the United Kingdom model and in particular to learn from the private finance initiative schemes operating in the United Kingdom. While I am sure he will accept that this initiative was the creation of the last Conservative government, it has been so successful that it has been wholeheartedly embraced now by the new Labour government.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I think we could use the opportunity presented to the House this evening to set conditions in which public‐private partnerships can flourish. We must ensure that conditions of legal security or, more properly expressed, legal certainty apply. The public sector needs to know that the legal framework for public‐private partnerships can flourish with private investment in trans‐European transport network projects; that these investments will be secure and will not necessitate at some future date that the public sector or the governments must intervene to bail out the private investment financing or operation of the project.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the European Union in my view can benefit from the United Kingdom experience I referred to earlier, where we have built up some very real, concrete expertise in both road‐building and the construction of new schools.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, through the Danesin report and the Commission communication we must seek clarity in the implementation of competition rules to avoid any distortion of competition within and between the Member States. Equally, there should be greater transparency and clarity in the implementation of the European Union rules on public procurement. Also, greater access to long‐term financing and availability of risk capital will be hugely beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the Danesin report will be a great and positive step along the way, building on the Commission communication to create such public‐private sector partnerships. I am delighted that three major UK schemes will benefit as priority projects: the Ireland‐UK‐Benelux road scheme, including access to the east coast ports, the Channel Tunnel rail link and the west coast mainline rail improvements. I would make a plea that the A120 road scheme in north Essex will benefit sooner rather than later.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and address myself to the Danesin report also on public‐private partnership financing.</p>
<p class="contents">New trans‐European networks, as has already been stated in this House, provide an opportunity for greater mobility and easier access to the market for people with their goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further consequence which links in with our debate here some time ago on the coming into operation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is the question of employment. These are such major infrastructural works that they require massive amounts of people to be employed which gives a kick‐start to many economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of reform of the EU financial systems and reductions in structural funding and cohesion funding to certain countries under the Agenda 2000 reform package, it is essential that we find new ways of financing these very essential projects. So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public‐private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union, which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, whom I congratulated on his initiative on this point, has drafted a report into this question and has seen the positive benefits which could accrue from it. That is not to say that we do not need safeguards to ensure that there is not exploitation and to maintain the legal certainty which my colleague, Mrs McIntosh, referred to. It also encourages governments like the Irish Government to be innovative in the way that they look to the future. They need not be afraid to take on the challenge of a reduction in future funding from Europe, and should grasp the opportunity to encourage Irish business and the Irish financial institutions to get involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could I say that if we are to guarantee the success of these measures then it must be done on a tripartite basis with national, local and European involvement. Most importantly, now we can bring in private financing to give the extra impetus and kick‐start needed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, in the little time I have, I wish to say something about the trans‐European transport networks. I want a voice of protest to be heard on behalf of working people.</p>
<p class="contents">Six years after the White Paper by Mr Delors, the trans‐European networks, which were put forward as a way of increasing employment to compensate for the complete disruption of labour relations and the promotion of flexible forms of employment, are still making very little progress due to lack of the resources to finance them. Now, the Commission is abandoning any final pretence. Knowing that against the background of restrictive financial policy for EMU there is no prospect of Community or state funding for the trans‐European transport networks, it has adopted its well known policy. In an ingenious way, it is handing over these important infrastructures to private profit‐oriented capital and indeed promoting a whole range of legal guarantees to ensure that the related capital and profits will be completely secured.</p>
<p class="contents">That policy is to the disadvantage of our peoples and their interests, it promotes an accumulation of private profits to the cost of the public service, and it constitutes a complete abandonment of any prospect that trans‐European networks could contribute to the development of employment. Let us understand this at last: the market cannot provide solutions for social problems, nor for the problems of infrastructure and public service development.</p>

It takes a brave Commissioner to throw a green paper – not to the lions – but to the harbour masters and port authorities in this way. They will immediately begin to compare and compete with each other. However, the real challenge does not come from the neighbouring port, but from the roads. The message from Parliament this evening will be that by modernising, by giving the ports some opportunities and by being united, we can change transport habits. Go home to your own ports and tell them that it is not the neighbouring port which is the competition, but the roads, and then let us ensure that we make some progress. I know that there are very large differences between ports as far as public‐private partnership financing and harbour costs are concerned, but let us remember that we cannot change transport habits through market forces alone. So now and then we should also try to do so through political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say to Mr Wijsenbeek that I regard him very highly, but his contribution this evening shows that he does not know very much about ports and ships. So stick to the roads, Mr Wijsenbeek, and the rest of us will take care of the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also express my unreserved support for the project concerning a strategy for global navigation systems. It is extremely important that we participate in this, and that the Commission, the Council, Parliament and so on all contribute to creating a European profile in this area.</p>

The great challenge facing the European Union at the moment is to ensure that its industry establishes the EGNOS service. In doing so, we will have reached the goal of having a specifically European component in the first generation global satellite system for the year 2003. It would be similar to the Union"s great achievement in the area of GSMs, having already succeeded with the second generation of mobile communications, and now trying to succeed with the third.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that this first generation of satellite communications still has to rely on the dominant military systems: both the American GPS and the Russian GLONASS. However, there is no doubt that this first step must act as a trampoline for the next stage, that is, GNSS2, which is planned for 2008. This will be exclusively European and will be independent of the Americans and the Russians. A great deal of patience is required in the race to achieve this objective of the fifth framework programme for research.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to make two recommendations. Firstly, the group of experts being formed for this purpose, which is naturally going to rely on the European Space Agency, must in no way marginalise Eurocontrol. And secondly, if a decision is finally made to use the Structural Funds for the resources needed, these must be provided in accordance with the regulations, with absolutely no exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I have time to say on this excellent report by Mrs Langenhagen.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mendes Bota </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, it is quite clear that the construction of the trans‐European transport networks, envisaged in the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment in 1993, has veered off course.</p>
<p class="contents">The straitjacket of the stability and employment pact has led the Member States to restrict their budgets and investment plans for major public transport works. However, aware of the multiplying effect of this type of investment on economic growth and the creation of jobs, and also on the internal cohesion of the Union, these same Member States still want to take this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we escape from this impasse? Using partnerships between the public and private sectors or national and regional partnerships may be one solution. However, these cannot solve all the problems because it is never easy to reconcile objectives of financial profitability with those of risk control which govern private investment. This is due to the equilibrium between macroeconomic, social and environmental criteria which must be achieved by public bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that increased effectiveness may be achieved by transferring the technical, commercial, financial and management experience of the private sector to the PPPs during the initial design stage of the projects. It is also true that there could be better coordination between the Community instruments for financial assistance, the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds, the EIF, the EIB and even potential new instruments such as structurally subordinated loans and the so‐called ‘mezzanine funds".</p>
<p class="contents">But we must take care! Our hope that these partnerships will provide a miracle solution must not be too high as there are many projects, particularly in less‐populated or more outlying areas of the EU, which will not raise any interest because they are simply not profitable. It is not just a question of altering the legal framework of public contracts or competitions in order to encourage these partnerships, as this is not enough. Without a strong political will on the part of the EU, the 14 priority projects defined at Essen will not be developed. In 1995, these projects amounted to nearly ECU 99 billion. Between then and today, the Community budget has allocated the measly sum of ECU 1.8 bn, or less than 2 %, which is absolutely nothing. Agenda 2000 only provides ECU 5 million, which is also nothing, and nothing plus nothing will continue to produce nothing, until a sensible sum is provided which can achieve something.</p>

I should like to make five points. One, it is a complex business, and each country has its own subsidies. To my mind, greater transparency must be an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Two, not only state aid but also differences in the regulations and their application in the field of the environment, safety and employment can lead to distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, how does the Commission believe it can strike a balance between its objective of regional development and its task of combating distortions of competition?</p>
<p class="contents">Four, I would criticise certain passages in the Green Paper on financial intervention in order to increase the efficiency of ports. I would warn against new interventionism at European level. I place my trust in market mechanisms to produce efficient ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, good links with the hinterland are important for Europe"s competitiveness. Public‐private partnership seems to be a good instrument in mobilising the necessary private capital. Could the Commission primarily look at the waterways and railways in this connection? I thank the Commissioner for his positive response to the link between the Scheldt and the Seine. I should like to ask him, also on behalf of my colleagues Mr Tindemans, if he could consider whether the Commission can play a stimulating role in the renaissance of the ‘<span class="italic">Ijzeren Rijn</span> ", as we call it. This link is included in the trans‐European networks" list of priorities for combined transport. It is by far the shortest rail link between Antwerp and the German Ruhr, but the special thing about it is that it runs through three countries when the supposed national interests of the three countries do not correspond. Hence our question.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Wijsenbeek I think it would be a good idea to consider the advantages and disadvantages of cooperation between ports, given world developments. I would point to the cooperation in the aviation sector here.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Stenmarck </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, first of all let me congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent report on European sea ports. Maritime transport is very important, in particular because it has the great advantage of being able to reach most parts of the world in a reasonably convenient way. The majority of the world's goods are therefore transported by sea. In terms of figures, this means that the EU"s ports handle over 90 % of Community trade with third countries and that 30 % of intra‐EU traffic is handled by the port sector. More than 200 million passengers a year are also transported in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime transport also has a less damaging impact on the environment than other forms of transport. During its work, the committee stressed that the various research and development studies being carried out in the infrastructure sector should take account of long‐term environmental effects. But despite its numerous advantages, issues relating to port and maritime infrastructures have often been marginalised in EU discussions. This is clearly indicated by the fact that this branch of the transport sector was not included in the initial discussions on the trans‐European transport networks. But as a result of increased trade with more countries and the opening‐up of new markets, especially in some of the former Eastern bloc countries, the maritime sector has grown considerably and become more globalised. While all of this is extremely good news, it is essential to encourage the sector and to promote further development. As a matter of course, therefore, all countries should to a large extent apply the same rules, practices which distort competition should be eliminated, and the efficiency of our ports should be increased. In this way, we shall be able to strengthen the EU's overall position in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, it would clearly be advantageous for EU ports to be integrated into the trans‐European transport networks. It would enable us for the first time to adopt a truly comprehensive approach to the transport sector as a whole. We might then be less inclined to deal with transport legislation on a piecemeal basis and more inclined to view the sector as a single entity – a major advantage in many respects.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee's view, the Commission should make recommendations on the future public financing of port infrastructures at the earliest opportunity. The report by the Transport Committee contains one item which I regard as crucial, namely that transport networks and the rules relating to them should not just apply to the existing Member States. They must be extended as quickly as possible to cover the EU's neighbours and, in particular, the applicant countries in the former Eastern bloc states.</p>

It is a great pleasure for me to see that the Commission and the Council have succeeded in reaching agreement on a strategy. The strategy follows the approach which Parliament set out in earlier decisions on European space travel, on the basis of the reports which the former Member of the European Parliament, Mr Toksvig, and I myself presented in the last parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of increasingly accurate systems with accompanying communications possibilities will lead to a strengthening and a much better and safer use of European airspace. The economics and safety of the roads will be improved and there will be substantial savings in the modernisation of railway equipment, for example in connection with reconstruction in Central and Eastern Europe. I expect the ESA – the European Space Agency – to continue to act as the EU's technological arm in this area. Even if substantial public financing could prove necessary, there is no doubt in my mind that the savings on new infrastructure projects will easily be able to pay for much of the establishment of GNSS.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all three rapporteurs for their reports and, indeed, all who have contributed to what has been a very interesting and mixed debate this evening. It is very regrettable that this joint debate does not allow us to do full justice to each of the reports we have been considering, so my responses will be rather more limited than I would have liked under other circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with Mr Danesin's commendable report on public‐private partnerships in trans‐European transport network projects. I should like to respond to Mr Sisó Cruellas, who was good enough to stand in for Mr Danesin, and report on some recent initiatives undertaken by the Commission. First, together with the European Investment Bank, we have examined further setting up a mezzanine fund to play a catalytic role in the development of public‐private partnerships and to encourage the participation of institutional investors in the financing of the trans‐European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will be aware that our proposal to amend the TENs financial regulation envisages support for the development of risk capital funding. If the support of Parliament and the Council can be secured for such an initiative, we hope to see it taking effect from 2000. In a related and encouraging development, the Vienna European Council has asked the EIB to look at how it can develop its instruments to support the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, amongst the initiatives and developments on which I should like to report, the House will be aware of our proposal to increase the budget for transport TENs to ECU 5bn in the period between 2000 and 2006. Although that would obviously still be a very small fraction of the projected total investment needs, its main value would be in levering other funds, which is obviously important for the development of public‐private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we welcome Mr Danesin's call for clear and flexible legislation on public contracts. As honourable Members in this House may know, the Commission has already presented a general communication on public procurement which will be followed before Easter by another that specifically addresses the application of public procurement legislation to concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I am happy to undertake to report to this House on policy changes and key developments relating to the projects listed in the annex to the Commission communication. For example, the development of the Dutch section of the PBKL high‐speed train link has now reached the point at which the Dutch authorities will decide upon what form of concessions they will offer in a public‐private partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should inform the House that the listed projects were simply those so far identified as being suitable for the application of a public‐private partnership approach. That obviously does not apply to all infrastructures. Most of those listed were at a very early stage of consideration and, naturally, the Commission has been actively involved in continuing discussions.<br />I welcome the positive response that this report gives to public‐private partnerships and the way in which that view has substantially been echoed in the course of the debate this evening. Apart from its other merits, that report will further underline the value of encouraging the private sector to supplement limited public sector resources and to help to improve project design and to increase value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski has written a characteristically excellent report on the Green Paper on sea ports and maritime infrastructure, published 13 months ago. I welcome the fact that the report supports the full integration of ports into a multimodal trans‐European network and also recognises that the Green Paper is a valuable basis for achieving greater transparency in conditions of competition between and within the ports of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and the Commission are also in agreement that any rules on sea ports should always respect the subsidiarity principle. Consistent with that, of course, European Union ports policy must never be centralised or over‐centralising. Imposing or trying to impose any so‐called uniformity on the activities, charges, operational methods or many other aspects of port operations would be wrong and counterproductive and it is certainly not an objective of our ports policy. As the report acknowledges, we want free and fair competition. Obviously, that objective poses particular challenges for financing and charging imports simply because current practices vary significantly. Increasing numbers of ports seek to cover their costs through charges, whilst others still rely on other more traditional forms of financing. It is a divergence which could potentially distort competitive conditions significantly and also contradict fairer competition, which, of course, must be based on non‐discrimination between users and increased transparency of port accounts. I believe, however, that the view expressed in the report that the proposed directive on charging is not the right instrument for achieving these goals may be based on a misreading of our true intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome this opportunity to clarify the point and say plainly that we do not want to harmonise port tariffs. Any proposed charging framework will be flexible and based on certain general practical principles while commercial considerations, including the actual setting of tariffs, will be left to individual port managements, as indeed it must be.</p>
<p class="contents">In preference to a charging framework, the report calls for guidelines on state aids to ports. Whilst I would agree that the current approach to state‐aided ports certainly needs to be clarified I have to say that state aid guidelines would not, on their own, address the whole issue of financing and charging. They cannot, therefore, be a full substitute for a charging regime. In fact state aid guidelines and charging frameworks will complement each other and both will be needed in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the call in the report for an inventory of current public financing and charging practices. I am glad to be able to inform the House and Mr Castricum, Mr Jarzembowski and other honourable Members who raised the issue that we have recently sent a comprehensive questionnaire to Member States so that they can provide information that will be a useful source of knowledge about the practices in relation to financing and charging and a good basis for drafting legislative proposals later this year. When that information has all been returned – hopefully by the end of next month – I trust that we will be able to put it together in a form that would be available to Parliament, since I know there are many Members who are interested in the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that Mr Jarzembowski's report sees no need to consider legislation on the matter of port services. As someone who tries to avoid proposing unnecessary legislation, I would like to be able to share that view. However, the increasing number of complaints that we have received in the Commission, in DG VII, from port users, especially about the provision of technical nautical services, demonstrates that there really is a problem that needs an effective response.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I would make is that any proposal for legislation would be complementary to our examination of individual cases and would address only general broad criteria for access to the market and training requirements whilst respecting important safety considerations and local circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we can all agree that market access must be founded on the principles of transparency, non‐discrimination and high safety standards while giving due respect to public service obligations. I believe that the time is right for a proposal that would make such provisions. I look forward to discussing the issue further with Mr Jarzembowski and his parliamentary colleagues, many of whom are doubtless here at this debate this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to Mrs Langenhagen's report on navigation and positioning systems. Again, I am grateful to the honourable Member for her support, not for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the Union's approach to the development of the global navigation satellite system is vitally important, not only for transport reasons, but also in terms of employment, competitiveness and our wider strategic interest. Since this approach is strongly supported in Mrs Langenhagen's report I concentrate on the work that the Commission has been doing since January last year following the publication of our action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">First, with the support of the GNSS forum of experts and industrial representatives, we are now on track to provide recommendations on the policy approach that the European Union should follow by February. In fact the draft proposal will be available early next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we have developed our international contacts, especially with the United States of America and Russia, and from those contacts it is clear that the United States of America will not accept joint ownership and control of the core global positioning system, primarily of course because of its continuing military role. But that does not preclude a genuine willingness to cooperate with us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian Federation also appears to be very keen to cooperate and also to accept our conditions. Without our assistance there would certainly not be a fully operational GLONASS system for some very considerable time to come. Russia's ambition is to contribute to a state‐of‐the art European GNSS developed from GLONASS and we are conscious of course of the fact that it has an allocation of scarce frequencies as well as extensive experience of operating a global satellite system.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background the financial issues are obviously particularly crucial. Naturally I am very much aware that Europe could decide to have no system at all. As I have often made clear that may seem to be the cheapest option but only to the very short‐sighted. I am absolutely convinced that such passivity would be immensely costly in the long term because of what it would imply in terms of lost market opportunities and under‐performance in terms of European growth and indeed employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It could also leave us dependent, as Mrs Langenhagen has pointed out, on a system over which Europe had no control or influence for all our increasing satellite navigation transport needs, many of which are safety‐related, not to mention other economic and social activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission therefore we are examining costs and we are examining all options including public‐private partnerships and the involvement of other countries in the development of a European GNSS system.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear, of course, is that we will not be able to charge for services that the United States of America makes available free. Public money will therefore be necessary if we are to go ahead with the system. I realise the implications of that but I have to emphasize that GNSS is a vital part of our positioning and navigation network. Because satellite signals transcend boundaries, it is quintessentially trans‐European. The current Agenda 2000 discussion of the TENs financial regulation will therefore be crucial in determining the extent to which the public sector contribution of GNSS can come from the budget of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">While we will of course be seeking a mechanism to allocate fair proportions of the costs between different user groups, the size of the overall financial envelope for TENs and our proposal to increase the limit on the share of a project that can be financed from the Community budget from 10 to 20 % in exceptional cases are vital matters for the future of Community assistance for GNSS.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore encourage Mrs Langenhagen, and all other Members, to follow the TENs financial regulation very closely, to give the same attention to the broader Agenda 2000 discussions on the finance available for internal policies in order to ensure that adequate finance is available for GNSS.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would ask everybody to work to ensure that the rules eventually adopted do not excessively restrict the share of the crucial trans‐European project that can be financed from the TENs budget. If there ever was a case for Community commitment to network development then it must be in the advance of our policy in global navigation satellite systems. We will reap massive benefits if we are properly engaged. We will suffer horrendously and for generations to come if we do not make that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certain that is the accumulated view of this House. I hope that it can be shared by the Members of the Council. I am sure that Members of this House will be active in all of the areas required to ensure that we get an adequate financial regulation, a sophisticated policy on global navigation satellite systems and an urgent execution of both to the advantage of the Community.</p>
