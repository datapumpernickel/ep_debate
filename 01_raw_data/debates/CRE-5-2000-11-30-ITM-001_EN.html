<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gayssot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was especially keen to be with you today for the debate in the European Parliament on the first maritime package because you are about to examine three important texts which are a vital step in an issue which recent events have unfortunately made into headline news.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has 60 000 km of coastline bordering some of the busiest seas and oceans in the world. The importance of maritime matters to Europe is undeniable but that also gives Europe a tremendous responsibility. Since the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident last December, considerable work has been done within our European institutions in order to move forwards. In this connection, the first package of measures proposed by the Commission in March has been examined by Parliament and by the Council. A second package of measures is expected in the near future. The European Council in Biarritz examined this issue, and it will again be an important subject at the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the occasion of each disaster, the people of Europe express their anger at the lack of maritime safety and at the risks posed by the dozens of ships transporting toxic or hazardous substances which sail the waters off our shorelines on a daily basis. I believe we ought to understand their emotion and their anger. Naturally, we want to ensure that things move forward. How can we accept maritime transport, which is vital for our trade and commerce, being developed to the detriment of environmental and human safety? How can we accept that more and more ships, increasingly larger in scale and increasingly automated, ply the waters off our coasts without always respecting the strict safety, navigational control and social rules, after the fashion of land and air transport?</p>
<p class="contents">What we can no longer accept is the logic which makes the quest for the lowest price the operational rule of maritime transport. What we can no longer accept, what we must no longer accept, is the connivance of certain States, which we know to exist, which register some of the oldest and most corroded ships, sometimes for just a few dollars. What we cannot and must not accept are the shipowners and operators who deploy underqualified and underpaid crews, classification societies which, for fear of losing a client, pay scant regard to the quality of the ships and their crews, and charterers who seek, above all, to reduce their costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am told, especially in France, that stringent national measures must be adopted to protect French coasts: it has also been proposed that French coastguards should be deployed. But the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> were not French ships. Their owners and their classification societies were not French, and they were both sailing in international waters when they sank. Hence, even though each State has to assume its own responsibilities, decisions must be taken on a broader scale, at least on a European scale. To achieve this, the Members of the European Parliament not only have a role to play – and I am well aware of their determination to do so – but, even more importantly, they are crucial in pushing forward Community regulations as far and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe have woken up. We see this in the case of animal meal and mad cow disease. They are now challenging us; they are challenging international institutions and are calling on them to be effective. If a new accident, a new shipwreck, occurs tomorrow off the coasts of Europe, we will all be justifiably denounced for our shortcomings, given these inadequate rules. Personally, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, that the fact that we are examining these proposals today is living proof that the European Parliament is an effective institution, which can take on board the concerns of our citizens speedily and effectively. That is why I am delighted that, under the impetus of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, significant progress is about to be made towards bringing about a truly safer maritime Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, on the basis of proposals we made last February, the European Commission put forward its own proposals with the greatest alacrity. Today, you are examining these three texts in first reading. I recognise that the European Parliament and its rapporteurs are motivated by an unshakeable will to see the rapid adoption of texts that are binding and effective in terms of maritime safety. I also recognise that we share the same objective of improving maritime safety and the same analytical approach to the methods of achieving this. I also recognise, as do the rapporteurs, that the technical aspects of the texts relating to classification societies and to port state control may need to be gone into more deeply.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to whether the fact that there is a new part-session of Parliament in December will make it possible for any residual problems to be solved. This may also enable the Council Presidency to have discussions with the Member States with a view to obtaining the Council’s approval of your proposals and to adopting the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority voting. We could seek the broadest consensus on the system of liability of classification societies, on toughening up the system of banning the worst offending black-listed flag states, on introducing on-board black boxes, and on putting in place immediate inspections for ships posing the highest risks.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this fundamental text on enhancing maritime safety and eliminating single-hull oil tankers, we can already congratulate ourselves on the work that has been carried out by the European Parliament. If this text is adopted, as I believe your rapporteur will propose, it will make it possible to phase out more than a third of single-hull oil tankers by 2005 and the remaining two thirds by 2010. This is a considerable achievement and it should make it possible for the dangerous ships sailing off our coasts to be speedily replaced and to ensure the greatest level of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, as you see, here we have the opportunity to enhance the safety of maritime transport. We all know that these measures, which you are going to be debating today, are inadequate. The Heads of State and Government highlighted the urgent need to examine a second package of proposals relating to the supervision and transparency of maritime transport and to the establishment of a European agency, and to making all actors involved in the maritime transport of hazardous or toxic substances aware of their responsibilities. What is more, on this occasion France reaffirmed the need to set in motion a Community project on the training and working conditions of seamen, and I know that some of you also share this concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, it seems to me that the determination of all Community institutions is decisive, and I am convinced this determination is total. It is starting to bear fruit here in Brussels, in the European Parliament: so that only safe, sound ships with trained crews living and working under normal conditions are authorised to sail, so that, at last, responsibility falls to each of the actors involved in maritime transport, so that the rules of maritime transport evolve with due regard to the coastal State’s right and its aspiration to protect its environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I believe it is beyond doubt that the Commission, like the French Presidency considers the question of maritime safety and environmental protection to be of extreme importance. In fact, it has been among the highest priority items on the Commission's agenda ever since the fatal sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika </span>11 months ago. Even more recently, only some weeks ago, another tanker, this time a chemical one, the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> sank off the coast of France. Once again we were reminded of the potential disastrous consequences of such accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The European public no longer tolerates oil spills or other environmental disasters caused by industrial accidents in shipping or otherwise. Indeed, citizens have the right to expect that ships are safe and that they can transport their cargo in an environmentally acceptable way without endangering the life and economy of people living on nearby coasts. Let me say that I saw the effects of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident myself whilst visiting the site and I know that it takes a very long time and a lot of manpower and, of course, money to clean up. The effects are disastrous. It is evident that, because of geography, it will always be the same regions that suffer the risks of maritime oil transports, despite the fact that the benefits of such transports are enjoyed by the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken this message very seriously indeed and it is exceptional that the Commission has acted so quickly and so consistently with six different legislative proposals within a year covering very different issues. All lie at the very heart of the regulations of shipping as a whole and I want to remind you that, in addition to the three proposals which are to be discussed here today, the ‘Erika II’ package, as Mr Gayssot has already mentioned, will be put on the table next week. This set of measures will propose the creation of a European maritime safety agency, a new European system for the adequate compensation of oil pollution victims and a new traffic surveillance system for EU waters.</p>
<p class="contents">This swift and focused approach resulting in the two ‘Erika’ packages and six proposals has created an enormous momentum. I believe it is fair to say that only after the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster did Member States and the international maritime community fully understand and feel the determination of the European institutions to improve maritime safety. They have realised that the determination remains even if such actions involve friction between the EU and the international maritime institutions and tension with the economic interests of the maritime industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that there are Commission proposals on the table we must not lose this momentum and forget the issue until the next accident happens. In order to make a real change for maritime safety, the three institutions, but in particular the two co-legislators, must adopt the texts. Legislation alone is not enough. Member States must also ensure that they have the proper means to implement it, in particular I am thinking of the necessary recruitment of port state control inspectors. Otherwise the benefit of the exercise will not be what the public expects from us. On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that it is our clear intention not to spare any effort to make ships safer and our seas cleaner, both next year and in the years to come. This goes for all sectors of maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking Mr Gayssot, President of the Transport Council of Ministers, for his encouraging comments. We hope and expect that the Transport Council, on 21 December, will add their part to the common determination among the European institutions to bring about a real improvement in maritime safety by the adoption of common positions on all three texts. The Commission is not ready to accept any compromise just for the sake of achieving a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to thank this House and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Ms McKenna and Mr Watts, for their understanding of the importance of the first ‘Erika’ package which is evidenced by the excellent work already done in such a limited time, and for the generally good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in the field of maritime safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, in a few days time Europe will mark the first anniversary of the loss of the oil tanker, <span class="italic">Erika</span>. Since then, sadly, there have been many other disasters at sea, we know only too well. Before the <span class="italic">Erika</span> sank, many other ships sank as well, with the loss of oil, other cargoes, or tragically, the loss of lives of crew or passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right. In that context, I wish to pay tribute to the Commission for bringing forward this ‘Erika’ package to try and right some of those wrongs, to try and prevent another <span class="italic">Erika</span> occurring. We also pay tribute to the French Presidency, in particular the minister, for his determination to ensure that, in a very brief period of time, we truly learn the lessons of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and make sure that they are applied to prevent an <span class="italic">Erika</span>-type disaster occurring again. Without the minister’s determination, without the determination of the French Presidency, the IMO's working committee would not have agreed with us that single-hull tankers should be phased out rapidly throughout the world. So I pay particular tribute to them for that achievement, which I hope is confirmed by the full IMO assembly very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem throughout the world is not the lack of maritime laws but the lack of the willingness of countries throughout the world to enforce them. For example, I am afraid that the whole history of port state control is the lack of willingness of Member States within the European Union and beyond to implement port state control adequately. That is why we welcome the amendment to the directive because it gives us the ability to make sure people implement the port state control Directive effectively. However, in my view as rapporteur, the proposal from the Commission simply does not go far enough. It is not strong enough. In our view, if implemented, the Commission's proposal would allow another <span class="italic">Erika</span> to occur. That is why this morning we cannot agree with the Commission's proposal but we are putting forward four proposals which we believe will significantly strengthen the proposal and would therefore secure this Parliament's support.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we agree that there needs to be enhanced compulsory inspections of the most dangerous ships. We all agree on that, but we have to find the methodology by which that particular priority can be implemented, and we have yet to secure an agreement between the three institutions on that. I think it is within sight but we need to be sure that this agreement will be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we make a demand again this morning for 'black box' style voyage data recorders to be fitted, not on just some ships or new ships, or in 10 or 20 years time, or whenever the IMO eventually agrees. We want black boxes in all ships as soon as possible. That is a very clear, fundamental demand, which we are not willing to compromise on.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we support, and there is a great amount of support, that a dangerous ship should not simply be detained and then allowed to return to sea. If you are detained three times in a period of 24 months or 36 months, then you should be banned for life – three strikes and you are out. There must be a clear signal to sub-standard ships that we will not tolerate them in European waters or in European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have a clear message to the flags of convenience, the black-listed states. Countries like the Lebanon, Liberia, Syria, Azerbaijan, Albania, whose fleets we all know in our hearts are unacceptable overall. Seventy, eighty, ninety per cent of their ships have serious defects. We cannot tolerate a situation where these rogue flag states continue to allow their ships to sail the seven seas. We must as a Parliament express our clear view that in a matter of years we simply will not allow them in. Again I hope that we can find a compromise between the three institutions to secure the objectives which I know we all share. We must eliminate dangerous ships. We must protect our environment and, ultimately, we must save lives at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the importance of safety at sea is, I think, obvious, as we have seen twice in France recently with the <span class="italic">Εrika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> and as we have seen in my own country with the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Express Samina</span>, a real human tragedy. Eighty lives were lost and the final act of the tragedy was played out just yesterday, when the chief executive officer of the company which owned the ship committed suicide.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Parliament's stand on this particular subject? Allow me to remind you that Parliament demanded action right from the start, on the very day the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was shipwrecked, calling on the Commission to put forward proposals for adoption. We have examined these proposals and, because certain misunderstandings have arisen, I should like to say that we agree with the French Presidency on the timetable, which is why we are holding the debate now, today, before the second Council of Transport Ministers, so that decisions can be taken at first reading. We have reached agreement as far as my report is concerned and, once it has passed its first reading, that will be that and we shall be able to start withdrawing single-hull tankers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there are still some problems with the other two reports. There are numerous points, as Mr Watts has already explained, where the European Parliament takes a firmer stand than the Council appears to be taking. I understand and I welcome the minister's efforts to expedite these two reports as quickly as possible and I therefore consider that, in principle, his proposal to discuss the matter, if possible in December, is a positive one. However, Minister, from my discussions today it would appear that your proposal is a little late – most people doubt that it will be technically possible for Parliament to find time in this last week to discuss the matter in detail from the beginning and vote on it in December. In all events, please be assured that Parliament is at the Council's disposal, it will vote on its reports, they will be passed to the Council, the Council can approve a common position and we shall examine the reports as quickly as possible – they will be our top priority. We shall be finished by spring, provided that the Council moves quickly and provided that the bilateral negotiations are a success and I think that they will be because the will is there on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the withdrawal of tankers, to come back to my report. Obviously, withdrawing single-hull tankers is a step in the right direction – in fact the IMO has also been making moves in this direction under the Marpol convention for some years now – and I think that the fact that the withdrawal of these tankers is being accelerated is even more encouraging. Not that this is a panacea, of course, as we saw with the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, which was a new, double-hull vessel, from which we must conclude that this measure alone is not enough. We also need to take fundamental action on shipping registers and port inspections. We need to advance on all fronts. In this sense, the initiative by the French Presidency to contact the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, in a bid to find a solution was an important initiative, because this is an international problem and international problems need international solutions. I may add that the Commission's initiative in presenting this position was an important initiative because it acted like a sword of Damocles, effectively pressuring the ΙΜΟ into getting a move on. The IMO working party did get a move on by reaching an agreement in principle – a few issues still need to be clarified, but most issues have already been clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the basic approach in my report? For large tankers I have kept to the timetable of the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation. For the second category, the post-Marpol tankers, I have kept, where there are different approaches, to the common European approach. And I think, in the end, we have struck a balance. We are protecting the environment, we are providing safety at sea but, at the same time, we have not touched competition in the shipping sector or the normal supply to the market. For small tankers, we have adopted a compromise position between the 5000-tonne limit set by the ΙΜΟ and the 600-tonne limit set by the Commission. We have reconciled the need for safety with the need to supply certain regions of Europe, such as island regions especially.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I think that we have taken a step forward today, a fundamental step forward. Parliament has taken a clear and unequivocal stand on the Commission's proposals, we are at the Council's disposal, in the hope, I repeat, that this issue will be brought to a close as quickly as possible, because all of us here, the Council, the Commission and the House, are acutely aware of the importance of this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ortuondo Larrea (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the <span class="italic">Erika </span>accident on 12 December of last year and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun </span>accident more recently clearly revealed the limits of the action of some classification and inspection societies in terms of monitoring the construction and, above all, the seaworthiness of vessels that are under their responsibility by delegation from the flag states.</p>
<p class="contents">However, and especially in this field, it is the public institutions who have the essential task of responding to the people’s demands with legislative initiatives that ensure the preservation of the environment and an optimum level of maritime safety, as well as the duty to ensure that the rules established are complied with correctly. With this in mind, and in order to remove the obvious differences that exist on an international level between the various classification societies in terms of the competence of their inspectors, the level of development of their IT resources and the degree of technical requirements in their inspections, the Commission has presented us with a proposal to amend Directive 94/57/EC which will apply to all vessels, including those transporting oil products, and which establishes the rules that the Member States, and the classification societies authorised by them, should comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has been analysed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, with opinions from both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. There have also been talks with the sectors concerned and a great deal of contact with the French Presidency with the aim of being able to arrive at a text agreed by consensus that can be adopted quickly by the two legislative bodies: the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of all of this, we have drawn up a parliamentary report amending the directive, which suggests improvements in various aspects aimed at strengthening the classification system, as a means and a valid tool for guaranteeing the safety of maritime traffic. Thus, first of all, it is considered that no element of this directive should be interpreted as an exception to the absolute duty of the shipowner, which cannot be delegated, to maintain and use seaworthy vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, the harmonisation of the requirements that classification societies have to fulfil is being considered, with the Commission, assisted by a committee, being responsible both for the granting and, if necessary, the suspension or withdrawal of their European recognition. In order to do this, they will take into account accident rates and the results of recorded incidents and accidents on all the vessels classified by each of the societies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, there is a commitment to improving the quality of vessel inspections as a measure to prevent maritime accidents. On the one hand, it is stipulated that the classification societies must have their own system of internal audits in order to measure the quality of their services in all the locations where they work, as well as clear rules for the responsibility and monitoring of all its branches and staff. On the other hand, it requires that inspections only be carried out by specialist, exclusive inspectors, that they may not have a relationship with or be dependent on the shipowner in any way, and that the shipowner may not control the vessel classification society.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, a high degree of transparency is established for information on the results of the inspections carried out on vessels, operating conditions or operating restrictions and changes, suspensions and withdrawals of class. This information must be made available to the European, State and port authorities, and to interested members of the public. Also, the transfer of a vessel from one class to another – change of classification society – is dependent on all overdue recommendations and conditions that may be pending being satisfactorily complied with. Thus, periodical inspections and supervisions are established, to be carried out by the Commission and the Member States in order to check whether this directive is being complied with by organisations that are recognised at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is stated that the Commission must lay down strict rules and ship maintenance inspection procedures, with a view to compelling all the participants concerned to assume their responsibilities. In this area, the initial proposals from the Commission and Parliament’s amendments aimed to define the system of financial responsibility for the classification and inspection societies. However, the Commission has already announced a second package on maritime safety, which will propose a system of responsibility for all the parties implicated in accidents: shipowners, the owners of the cargo, classification societies, etc. I therefore consider that the various parliamentary groups should not now get lost in a partial debate that is also futile and will prolong the time it takes before final approval, on what should be the financial responsibility of classification societies. I think it would be better for us to leave this for the second package and move forward immediately in order to reach a consensus at first reading with the French Presidency, so that in the next Council of Ministers on 20 December there will already be an agreement with the European Parliament and the first package can be adopted definitively this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment of western Europe. This region represents one of the most intensely industrialised areas of the world where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships. The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several tragic examples of accidental marine pollution from tankers and other ships carrying other forms of dangerous cargoes. As we have just heard, two of the most recent were the Italian chemical tanker, which sank in the English channel, and also the Maltese registered oil tanker, the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which sank off the coast of Brittany causing major environmental havoc.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, more by good fortune than planning, there has not yet been a major accident with a ship carrying radioactive materials. Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping-ground for much industrial waste. Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought for the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable. However, the legacy of the years when materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with very severe consequences. It is a lesson which tells us that, when we attempt to throw things away, they do not actually go away because there is no such place as 'away'.</p>
<p class="contents">This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Furthermore, there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational, historical, radioactive and other harmful substances. Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents, in terms of chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern. In terms of the environment, whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no consequence, the environmental impact remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumps of redundant munitions, is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States, the sights of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases a threat to human safety. Often fishermens' lives are at risk, as is the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful materials carried at sea or discharged into the sea, or which have been dumped as part of a historical dumping regime, is a vital prerequisite to facilitating the preparation and coordination of any responses necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective mitigation requires a rapid response. The longer an accident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact. Hence, it is too late to start trying to get information after an accident has actually occurred. Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations. It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessment of the risks. The public's trust in the authorities is important and must be ensured with adequate responses.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations have been made, what types of material are threatening and what impacts are to be expected. To this end, publication of information is a vital component in the establishment of a way for the general public to obtain information, emergency phone contact numbers, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation procedure the European Parliament delegation was able to reach a compromise with the Council, which is close to the original amendments on all the major questions. The definition of accidental marine pollution includes a reference to munitions dumping. A definition of harmful substances in line with the water framework Directive was added in order to cover but not, unfortunately, explicitly mention radioactive substances. The cooperation includes exchange of information and mapping of munitions dump sites. The polluter-pays principle is recognised, and the Member States should take this into account in order to provide compensation for damages. Nature protection organisations are also included in cooperation at local level. We did actually achieve most of what we wanted in the conciliatory procedure, maybe not exactly as we wanted, but we are happy with the result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">France may have been especially hit by various maritime disasters, in particular by the recent wrecks of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun </span>off the coast of Brittany, nevertheless what is at stake is the responsibility of the entire European Union, which managed to draw the necessary conclusions. The European Union has demonstrated its willingness to accept responsibility by putting forward strong proposals aimed at avoiding a recurrence of such serious accidents. I thank Mr Gayssot who, on behalf of the French Presidency, has shown great conviction and skill in dealing with these issues effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must be aware that these proposals which, as highlighted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, are essentially a response to the legal requirements which have been identified in the areas defined by their respective objectives will only be effective insofar as they are correctly implemented by the Member States and monitored by the Commission. I would therefore like to highlight the points which, I feel, cannot be ignored if, following the adoption of these regulations and this directive, the expected progress is to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the action of Member States must be translated into action integrated at European level. We must deploy adequate numbers of properly trained people, used to cooperation, whatever their country of origin, and to using similar equipment. I am convinced that this will mean, in the longer term, the establishment of a European coastguard. I expect a great deal from the second series of proposals and from the establishment of a European maritime safety agency. It is at this level that, in one way or another, this indispensable European cooperation must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we must, at all costs, eliminate ships whose characteristics give cause for the gravest concern, and this means we must demand transparent intervention on the part of the inspection authorities, who must take measures against ships in a poor condition, irrespective of their age and structure, in line with a significant minimum target factor. We must refuse to permit ships to transit the 200-mile exclusive economic zone if they are not equipped with an IMO-compliant voyage data recorder (VDR) intended to provide information for the purposes of inquiry in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor let us forget, as Mrs McKenna said, that a large percentage of marine pollution is due to practices coyly described as ‘operational’, that is, tank cleaning and other deliberate spills, against which the arsenal of deterrents must be intensified. I know how much attention Mr Gayssot pays to the action of Equasis and now to Galileo, which we must implement. Vigorous action must be taken on the question of flags of convenience, including that of the Kerguelen Islands in the case of France, and against ships which fly the flag of states with above average detentions and delays during the 36 months preceding the adoption of these directives, which are blacklisted in the annual report of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. Attention must also be paid to the complicated financial set-ups based on ‘brass-plate’ companies. My thanks go to Mr Watts for the specific proposals he has made in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteurs and I urge my fellow Members in the European Parliament to take these proposals into consideration. They seem to me such as to make significant progress possible, which is crucial for the effectiveness of the legislative resolutions we are going to be voting on, which must not remain dead letter terms throughout the territories and waters for which Europe is responsible. I have in mind not only the Atlantic and other oceans, but also the Mediterranean Sea, where disasters such as we have been experiencing could be irreversible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amending the directive in terms of greater stringency in its application and the harmonisation of legislation, especially regarding the selection of ships for inspection and the scope of the different types of selection is clearly a positive step. Even then, the European Union would need to ensure that current legislation is enforced by the Member States. The fact is that Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, France, Ireland and the Netherlands, which are obliged to inspect 25% of ships, do not do so. Worse still, the existing directives, even though they date from 1995, have still not been transposed into national legislation in Italy and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for Member States to enforce existing legislation, they must allocate sufficient resources to inspections so as to ensure the proper application of international conventions and the directive amended by the European Parliament. In concrete terms, this means employing additional inspectors, broadening the competences and the scope of inspection, notably concerning respect for social standards and for shipboard living and working conditions, and their publication. Since human error is the root cause of 70% of accidents, the inspection of crews, their living and working conditions, their level of training and their numbers must be an integral part of a ship’s inspection. Non-compliance with these standards must be a reason to detain a ship and to impose sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission proposals still do not go far enough: they, in fact, concern no more than twenty or so ships. The positions adopted by the French Presidency, which we have heard elsewhere, which would water down the Commission proposals even further, such as amending the proportion of ships targeted with the aim of reducing inspections by half, are naturally unacceptable. I am in complete agreement with the rapporteur about refusing port access to ships posing a serious risk, irrespective of age, and those that have been flying a flag of convenience for more than three years. We must also go further and ban them from sailing in Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we must strengthen international maritime law. Moreover, it seems to me that we need to be more restrictive concerning flags of convenience, especially those of Member States, as well as those, Minister, of the islands of Kerguelen, Wallis and Fortuna in the case of France.</p>

The three reports from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were adopted either unanimously or by an overwhelming majority in committee. In other words, we discussed the issues objectively and arrived at a common position. For that reason, it is important that we stand by that position.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was very honourable of you to ask at the last minute to have the votes on two of the directives postponed so that we can still reach an agreement. But I put it to you that this is a somewhat ambivalent move. First of all, we in Parliament were criticised for having caused a delay. The President of Parliament specially brought the debate and vote forward from the scheduled date in December to today's sitting. We have had no written statement from the Council which would have enabled us even to discuss a compromise. I believe your intentions are honourable, but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the Council. To that extent, it is impossible to change anything, because we discussed this material meticulously in our committees, and it would be impossible to hammer out a compromise wording on the various issues that are particularly awkward, to have these compromises printed in eleven languages and to discuss them with our colleagues in time for next Tuesday. I can therefore only ask you to accept the directive and the regulation in the form in which Parliament adopts them at noon today. That would take us as close as possible to our common goal of increasing maritime safety without delay. The choice is yours.</p>
<p class="contents">On those points where you feel unable to accept our proposals, produce a common position in December. Do not delay it in the Council. We are prepared to negotiate on proposed compromises for the second reading from January onwards, so that the second reading will be completed early next year, just like that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate that the urgent action upon which you are now insisting is not necessary. For example, in the case of port state control, we certainly want tighter rules, unlike the Council. But even if we did not complete the process in December, we should certainly have taken a huge step forward, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you managed to persuade the other States and your own administration to fulfil their obligations in matters of port state control under the old directive. So if you want to do something to improve safety at sea, recruit new inspectors, carry out stringent checks under the existing law, and we shall have achieved a resounding success.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the liability of classification societies, which is a highly complex subject, we shall have to discuss this calmly and carefully. We have discussed the material thoroughly in committee, we have adopted our opinions by a large majority or unanimously, and Parliament should do likewise at noon today. If you achieve the same level of agreement in December, we shall be through to the next stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is less satisfactory, as has just been pointed out, is our past record; heaven knows that the States of the European Union have scarcely covered themselves in glory in the realm of maritime safety. We know, of course, that port state control has not been a potent guarantor of maritime safety in the past, we know that the classification societies have not all discharged their duties as shipping inspectorates properly and conscientiously and that some of them have tended to be slipshod, and we know that tankers without double hulls are floating time bombs. The more appalling thing, however, is that we knew all of this before the <span class="italic">Erika </span>sank. Parliament has highlighted this situation time and again, and the sad fact is that the progress made since then would never have happened without this disaster and the public pressure that followed it. Nevertheless, it is all the better that we are set to act, at long last, today.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that you recognise Parliament's demand on port state control which Mr Watts made in his report. My first request to you is that the Council sign, seal and deliver this very quickly. It will then be law, as it were, and can be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies, irrespective of what is decided today. We shall agree to an international regime for double-hull tankers, but only on condition that a set of IMO rules is actually created in April. Our committee unanimously supports this linkage. If IMO rules do not materialise, we shall need European legislation. But we hope that IMO rules will be adopted in April.</p>
<p class="contents">For these double-hull tankers we shall need many good and safe new vessels. I should like to see European shipyards winning the orders to build these ships in fair and open competition. The Commission recently presented a report in which it documented the fact that Korea is pursuing a very unfair dumping policy in the shipbuilding industry. For that reason, Commissioner, I earnestly appeal to you and to your colleague, Commissioner Monti, to pledge this assistance which our shipyards need so urgently and to do so before Christmas. The shipyards of Europe are beset by uncertainty. Please help to ensure that the Commission sends a clear signal here. We are working to establish new credibility; we should not jeopardise it by letting the Commission take the wrong course of action.</p>

We must send out a clear signal to unsafe flag states, to shipowners, including those from the EU who use these flag states, to shippers who can then get cheaper prices, and to classification societies that are not doing their job properly. Safety comes at a price. We should have the courage to say so sometimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to take a minute to go into the report by Mr Watts. If a flag state defaults, then the port state must be given increased responsibility. That is a sound principle and we must stick to it. A black box, a blacklist: we are in complete agreement with all these things, but there are still a few points I would like to bring to your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries that impose stricter controls run the risk of being saddled with shipwrecks in their ports, and environmental risks, and sometimes with human tragedies, when crews are left to their fate. These are all things we must take into consideration, and we must ensure that the port is not disadvantaged by well-intentioned measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have a directive for end-of-life vehicles. Ought we not to have one for end-of-life ships too, because I would not be at all surprised if there were a few environmental risks there too, which we should take a close look at sometime?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must invest in manpower and in crews. Hence we will support a number of amendments tabled by Mr Vachetta. We also need to invest in inspectors, because even if there are too few of them, we at least need to make sure we have skilled workers at the helm, so to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we must also be realistic about our limitations as legislators. We have rules and they are not being implemented satisfactorily. A number of speakers have already made the same point. Take the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, a double-hull ship. It was built in 1989 and sailed under an Italian flag. It has been inspected three times in the last three years. So, there is more to safety than rules. Everyone who works in the sector bears a heavy responsibility. Those who are not prepared to take on this responsibility must stay out of our waters and our ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This oil cake symbolises the enormous amount of work we have to do to make our seas cleaner and maritime transport safer.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> are but the most recent names to date in the wrecking of an entire system. Firstly, the ecological system is being wrecked, with the natural marine heritage, flora and fauna destroyed or contaminated forever. Then there is social wrecking, with gangs of third-world seafarers, modern-day galley slaves, exploited literally to the point of slavery. Finally, we have economic wrecking, the result of untrammelled liberalism in maritime matters. The liberal tide of free trade which has been unleashed has swallowed up all safeguards, all preventative action and, ultimately, all morals, only to become engulfed itself in its own excesses, thereby revealing the lack of any Community maritime policy worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">Who today answers for the integrity and healthy conditions of maritime transport? What authorities claim to control and stamp out trade on the high seas, which is more maritime trafficking than maritime traffic? Nobody. What more proof do we need than these coffin ships fit only for the scrap yard, these thirty-year old single-hull tubs that take to the seas in stormy weather? Eight thousand of the ninety thousand ships plying the seas around the world are sub-standard in terms of safety, and four thousand are carrying hazardous substances. In the accident barometer measured against the gauge of shipwrecks the traditional mercury has been replaced by oil or residual acid.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport, Europe has taken up the challenge and, just 11 months after the loss of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly. This powerful political signal is in our hands. It is up to us to adopt the ‘Erika I’ package and it is up to the Council to accept its final amendments. In responding favourably to this acceleration of the timetable, our group has not, however, given up on the fundamental demands for the enhanced safety of the marine environment. The revisions of the directives concerning port and ship inspections should get rid of the lame ducks as far as the classification societies are concerned and appreciably increase the number of inspectors in the Member States, provided, however, that the latter provide adequate resources to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are also waiting impatiently for the second package, ‘Erika II’, with the establishment of a maritime agency and outline plans for a European coastguard. We may regret the delay in the timetable for the mandatory double hull for oil tankers and the Council’s abandoning of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues applicable to oil tankers, depending on whether they have a single or a double hull. Nevertheless, we support this report which, with its revision clause, provides for the so-called American timetable to be given a second chance in the event of failure at the Marpol Convention in April 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that zero risk does not exist, but it has to be said that zero responsibility must not exist either. With the ‘Erika I’ package we will be placing the first foundation stone of a substantive European maritime safety policy, in anticipation, of course, of the ‘Erika II’ package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Initiated by the French Government and driven forward within the European Council of Transport Ministers, the proposed European directives are an undeniable step forward. They are supported by the parliamentary reports we are debating this morning. The Watts report intensifies the measures against ships posing serious risks or flying flags of convenience without abolishing them altogether. The Larrea report on classification societies harmonises legislation, develops sanctions that go as far as the withdrawal of authorisation, and increases compensation in the event of accident. The Hatzidakis report, whilst banning single-hull oil tankers on the same dates as the American bans, nevertheless introduces a whole raft of exemptions which do not go in the desired direction, notably with the proposal to extend the deadlines for the phasing-out of single-hull vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the Watts and Larrea reports. We will vote in favour of them. The vote on the Hatzidakis report will be linked to the vote on the rapporteur’s amendments. The two directives and the regulation we are examining are an asset in confronting the enormous challenge of maritime safety and need to be implemented as quickly as possible. They are nevertheless inadequate in view of the magnitude of the problems that are posed.</p>
<p class="contents">Many players have stressed that the lack of maritime safety is largely due to deregulation and lenient practices. In the context of increased competition, the primary objective is to transport goods as quickly as possible, at the lowest cost, at the expense of safety, the environment and the crews. In measurable terms, the liberal rationale is effectively opposed to a high level of maritime safety. I reiterate that current European decisions, whilst being a definite asset, do not question this rationale. Hence the amendments to the Watts report presented by my group concerning social standards have been thrown out; yet the importance of the human factor is highlighted in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of great urgency that measures be adopted to put an end to social dumping and to review the conditions of crews in terms of status, salaries, training and working conditions. To enable effective control to be carried out in ports it is necessary to reinforce the body of maritime inspectors and their qualifications, and hence to free up financial resources. Much more stringent measures must be imposed to make classification societies effective. Flags of convenience must be banned. The consequences of their use in terms of non-compliance with standards are well known.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is time that the European Union committed itself to actually reforming the maritime system. This demands a strong political will and the financial resources to put in place even more controls. In the run-up to the second package of proposals it seems important to me that we turn our thoughts to promoting the lasting development of maritime safety, which will involve yet further guarantees of safety and quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, a year ago, three regions of France were hit by one of the most serious oil spills in European maritime history when the oil tanker, the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, sank. A few weeks ago, the west of France was struck by another ecological disaster, the wreck of the chemical tanker, the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, and it is only today that the European Parliament will take the decision to strengthen maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I was elected to office in a coastal region which is paying every day for the grave consequences of the wreck of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>: the serious lasting damage caused by this oil slick to the flora and fauna of the Loire, Brittany and Charentes. It is paying for the dramatic repercussions on its economy – the 2000 tourist season was a disaster. Workers in the fishing industry, in fish farming and aquaculture, and salt makers have been very badly hit. The inhabitants of this region would have appreciated greater speed on the part of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am delighted that the Commission proposals have taken on board the main demands formulated by the elected representatives of the coastal regions: the banning of single-hull oil tankers, strengthening port controls, and the assessment of classification societies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is unacceptable that the European Parliament should be moderating the initial Commission proposal concerning the ban on single-hull oil tankers. Mrs de Palacio recalled a few days ago in Rennes that, in less than a year, the United States was able to unilaterally put in place a draconian law regarding maritime safety. Why does the European Union need a timetable as long as that envisaged by our Parliament for the rapporteur’s amendments to phase out single-hull oil tankers? Double-hull vessels may not be a cure-all, but phasing them in is an important measure that is likely to be subject to substantial technical improvements. It seems to me that to create a discrepancy between the American timetable and the European timetable would be a very dangerous thing indeed. If this were to happen, it is easy to see which waters and which ports the dangerous ships would head for. It would be better if, faced with a proactive United States, our Parliament did not give the impression that, by systematically going for the lowest possible bid, it was soft on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">If another accident were to happen, how would we be able to justify the European Parliament adopting such a slow timetable in order to wait for the IMO to reach a compromise at global level, where there are so many countries accommodating flags of convenience, which are not the most zealous militants on behalf of safety? How, with the European Union under a French Presidency, will we be able to explain to the people of France that the European Parliament has abolished the necessary incentive and financial deterrence measures proposed in order to expedite the phasing in of double-hull oil tankers?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s role should be to speedily and fully support the most stringent and most effective provisions proposed by the Commission, not to dilute them. Quite the contrary, we should be proposing going much further. This first package is simply a first step. It is vital that we put in place a system which makes the entire transport chain aware of its responsibilities so that we can finally emerge from the current lack of transparency. We hope that the second package of measures to be proposed to us will be commensurate with this need.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of the technical measures that will be adopted, one of the major reasons for this lack of safety will remain as long as the exponential growth in traffic linked to the overdevelopment of the North Sea ports is not balanced in the Channel and North Atlantic areas. Is it reasonable that the zone of frequentation of the port of Rotterdam should extend as far as the South of France? Would not one of the most effective safety measures be to reduce traffic in this zone by regenerating the port infrastructures of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean?</p>
<p class="contents">This is the thrust of the two amendments to the reports by Mr Watts and Mr Hatzidakis which I tabled on behalf of my group. It is an area of consideration that the Member States and the Commission should explore. If the issue of overcrowding in the Channel and the North Sea is not dealt with, this zone will inevitably become a highway for marine pollution and a permanent threat to the safety of our seamen, the beauty of our coasts and the quality of our marine resources. The coasts of France are not there to become a dumping ground for European maritime traffic nor receive munitions, crude oil and styrene on their shores. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than 40 000 people die in road accidents every year, and although the victims of shipping disasters are fewer in number, each human life counts, and what is more, the natural world is coming under increasing threat owing to accidents at sea. Flora and fauna, in particular birds, are the victims of oil and other forms of pollution. It is sad that a tanker had to be wrecked off the French coast, with disastrous consequence, before the package of measures now on the table was put together. We are very satisfied with this set of measures, as we are with the various reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I will confine my comments to the Watts report on port state control. As the rapporteur very rightly points out, the condition of a tanker is more indicative than its age. I also support his demand for compulsory voyage data recorders. His regime for ships that have been detained several times or that fly a flag which has been on the blacklist for three years, makes a great deal of sense. What I would ask though, is what percentage of the ships should be refused at the present time on the basis of these criteria? Neither the size nor the status of such a flag state, for example an candidate country, must result in the undermining of the measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of the responsibilities of the port state, we must take care not to underplay the importance of the tasks to be fulfilled by the port authorities. It is highly likely that the refusal of the port concerned to allow the <span class="italic">Erika</span> to put in, dramatically increased the scale of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be to the credit of the acting President-in-Office of the Council if he were to set things right in his own country too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And so, with anger welling up inside us, we demanded immediate proposals from the Commission, which were put to us in March. Since then, we have experienced other disasters – some in Greece – and then the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> accident. We are all sick and tired of seeing our oceans and seas turned into dumping grounds. The McKenna report, in its third reading, recalls a certain number of key principles concerning accidental and deliberate pollution, for example the infamous illegal practice of tank cleaning, which are underpinned by the ‘polluter-pays’ principle. But certain problems continue to be intractable, even if things are moving in the right direction. Have we not wasted a lot of time since last March? Where in fact was the political will?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must commit itself to adopting stringent measures, which we are all hoping for, concerning port inspections, classification societies, the responsibility of shipowners and charterers and, finally, the responsibility of FIPOL, which is behaving in a scandalous manner. People in Brittany are still waiting for compensation for damages. Today, a large number of texts are being put to us, and there are yet others to come. This risks compromising cohesion, especially since a number of existing directives are at stake, one of which is the framework Directive on water. All this needs to be rationalised and we must turn our mind to producing a framework text which would simplify things at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interim, Minister, let us intensify technological research into marine depollution. It is important that the exchange of knowledge and cooperation are encouraged and sustained in this highly technical area in order to preserve our natural marine heritage. Let us hope that the measures we will adopt together will enable us to prevent further marine pollution and to protect our marine heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The guarantees of the seaworthiness of vessels required that considerable measures be adopted on the societies responsible and on inspections, as has already been said. The current situation is simply unacceptable. In this sense, the text proposed contains some new elements that are interesting and positive but which, in our opinion, are not sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion is demanding that we act swiftly in this situation, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, but that speed needs to be compatible with an acceptable minimum text. No one in the Council of which you are the Chairman should be tempted to accuse of us of moving too slowly; we demand some minimums and everyone will understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fundamental discrepancies are to do with two areas: on the one hand, the issue of responsibility and compensation, for which the amounts and the minimums should be adequate and equal across the whole of the European Union – we do not think that subsidiarity is acceptable. On the other hand, there is the independence of classification societies. That independence should be very clear at this time when many shipowners and proprietors are forming their own societies that are authorising boats. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in general, we are not happy with the compromise text. As we understand that it is the minimum text that the Council will accept, we are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading, but we will not vote against it because we recognise the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo, which resulted in some agreed amendments which show us the path to take for the next reading.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there are some interesting new elements, but they are not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the key question is will these measures actually lead to sub-standard ships being taken out of service? I am not so sure. Although it pains me to say it, the fact is that we are tinkering about at the edges with these measures, rather than tackling the real root causes of the problems. Mrs Peijs and I have carried out a short investigation, and I would very much like to hear the Commissioner’s response to the following question. Can you tell me what became of the 750 ships that Honduras removed from its register? Were they really taken out of service? And where are they in that case?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, is it true that in Cambodia, ships can be registered within twenty minutes via the Internet? Thirdly, I feel that a tough line must be taken with the classification societies. They are given too much free rein at present. I have tried to incorporate an incentive to take responsibility by raising the limited liability, which involves relatively small sums, but there is often nothing to be gained. But I <span class="italic">have </span>opposed the idea of unlimited liability because this impedes the market and is counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation with regard to the port state control? Commissioner, the current rules are not being properly adhered to as it is, never mind new ones. The Member States are simply not prepared to release enough money. There is a lot of talk but little action. As I see it, the Council must show greater commitment to making more resources available and exacting better sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the matter of how to deal with flags of convenience. I have quite a list. I will vote in favour of the rapporteur’s proposal that ships which fly a blacklisted flag for three years in succession should be excluded, thereby sending out a signal to these flag ships that sub-standard controls will not pass muster in Europe. We do not want them in our ports or in our waters.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, measures are an informal way of trying to bring safety to the desired standard. That is bad for the people, the sea, the environment and for the sector’s image. There should be more cooperation within the sector. I therefore support the initiatives for a European maritime platform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely imperative to ensure, taking the environment, safety, fishing communities, and tourism into account, that we do not have a repeat performance of what happened before. All eyes were on the <span class="italic">Erika</span> in the first instance, but a tanker was sinking in other waters off Turkey at the same time. The <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> was double-hull but contained chemicals in a particular form. Mr Gayssot, Greek ships have sunk without warning, when there were no storms in the vicinity. In short, as I understand, there are reasons besides storms in the Channel that should prompt us to consider stopping shipping traffic there.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we are talking about eight to ten thousand sub-standard ships. In other words, this is a very extensive problem. The age of ships is a factor, but not the most important one. Maintenance plays a very important part. That is what we are discussing now, along with manpower. The human aspect of the whole issue is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to concentrate on two dossiers: port state control and the phasing out of single-hull oil tankers. Everyone has stated – and I absolutely agree – that the current 25% inspection rate necessary for port state control has not been achieved yet. Some countries should take a very close look at what they need to do about this back home. These countries must make the necessary resources available, people must be trained and so on. In particular, the President of the current Transport Council has a great deal of work to do in his own country in the near future, even though he will not be the President any more.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, we should not just look at the technical side of the matter, we also need to look at crewing issues, and not just make laws, because as far as I am concerned, it would be no bad thing to raise that 25% inspection rate even higher in time, but first we need to take the other steps. Once again, enforcement is the most important measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few brief comments to make regarding single-hull ships. I am not happy with the fact that ships weighing 600 to 3000 tonnes have been left out. Nor am I pleased that the financial incentives have been completely removed from the dossier. I do not think the proposal was well drafted, but feel that we are certainly going to have to build financial incentives or sweeteners into these measures in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when we discuss dossiers of this kind, I think it becomes clear that we do not make the connection between our oil supply, on the one hand, and the fact that we are still using fossil fuels on the other. Suppose we have new ships built, phasing single-hull ships out and building new double-hull ones, then we will have a more extensive fleet, when what we should in fact be doing is introducing other forms of fuel supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is dynamic and disorganised and the risks inherent in it are those inherent in the global economy as a whole. It is not properly regulated. And there is nothing which international organisations such as the IMO or technology, black boxes and so on can do to provide this sort of regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we shall be voting in favour of everything our fellow Members have proposed because these are important steps. But what we really need is an integrated, organised policy of intervention and regulation on the right scale, or at least on a European scale, which is why, Commissioner, we hope that the second or third package which you present to us will contain provisions in this direction – surveys, inspectors, coastguards, ports, installations and fines for those who do what they do on the high seas, because quite simply, the fines cost less than doing the job properly in port. But these measures need to be taken at European level and applied by everyone, rather than varying from country to country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, everything we have said in our amendments in support of social and working conditions on board ships is quite simply a question of social and political solidarity. It is also a question of efficiency. The accidents which occurred in Greece, all<span class="bold"> </span>of them<span class="bold"> </span>were due in the end to so-called human error by people who were tired, who were sleepy, who had been working three days without a break and, so of course, they resulted in what has been so hypocritically referred to as so-called error. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our political duty requires us to adopt urgent measures but we must also enforce existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer confine ourselves to telling the people hit by these ecological and economic disasters that we have discussed these problems, that we are giving them some thought, and that we will avoid them in future. If we want to be credible, we must act quickly and put an end to sterile political diatribes. The time has long gone for simple compromises, which some, moreover, are saying will be difficult to achieve. We must adopt draconian measures and enforce them at an international level by reforming the erstwhile International Maritime Code.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it necessary to recall that maritime safety is the preserve of international law, especially since pollution never stops at the limits of national territorial waters and that it starts for the most part in international waters? Given that, it is no longer a question of making the players involved aware of their responsibilities – as that is not effective – but of striking with real binding force where the impact will be felt the most, that is at financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Our political action must be powerful and commensurate with ecological urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do away with hypocrisy. The way to achieve this necessarily lies in deploring the financial links that exist in some cases between shipowners and classification societies and in involving the parties concerned – shipowners, shippers, insurers and maritime administrations – in order to find a comprehensive solution. The reports currently under debate must be the draft for a genuine maritime safety policy, but they must in no way be limited to the Community context. We have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will recall that the Americans did not wait for us to promulgate the Oil Pollution Act in 1990 in response to the loss of the Exxon<span class="italic"> Valdez</span> in 1989, whilst the loss of the Amoco <span class="italic">Cadiz</span> in France dates back to 1978.

First there was BSE and the prohibition of animal meal, and then yesterday a bill banning fish meal was presented to the German Parliament. Yesterday too, we received news from the Commission, borne by three Commissioners who really ought to know better, that the Commission is not prepared to extend aid to the European shipbuilding industry beyond 31 December. What else do we intend to do to ourselves in the European Union? I cannot understand it, and the Koreans must be laughing up their sleeves.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, the Environment and Transport Committees have acted wisely and boldly in dealing with the first ‘Erika’<span class="italic"> </span>package, albeit in response to pressure in the wake of the accident. We quickly received the package and discussed it promptly in Parliament, which is a praiseworthy achievement. A second package is already under way. For your part, Minister, I am sorry to say that you have been telling us "we could…" and have been talking about flags of convenience, black boxes and the like. But why are you not doing these things right now, rather than tomorrow? You said, "We have the opportunity to improve safety.” So take that opportunity now, Minister, rather than later. Parliament has long been calling for such action. We parliamentarians are certainly not letting the grass grow under our feet. As to the accusation that Parliament has been solely responsible for any delay, I can only say that this is an attempt by others to hoodwink the public and divert attention from themselves and their own failure to deliver. For that reason, we cannot agree to a postponement of the vote. We must send the right signal. The flags are at half-mast already, and I do not expect a rapid result at any price but rather the best possible result within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure is an option. It may be a necessary evil, but it is an option, and I hope that all of us will contribute as best we can. We all know each other's positions by now, which is another reason why we need to vote today.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the classification societies are concerned, it is my duty and my wish to re-emphasise on this occasion that the main focal point of the present discussion seems to be liability. Everyone understands that. People's futures and the survival of many businesses are on the line here, not to mention the environmental implications. The Commission intends to look at this liability issue again in the second ‘Erika’<span class="italic"> </span>package, and rightly so. I am convinced, however, that it is vitally important in the context of maritime accidents to consider the whole chain of responsibility and to examine every aspect of the matter. It is regrettable that nobody is looking beyond the classification societies in the present discussion of the liability issue. This, at least, is the impression that has been conveyed. The spotlight is focused on the first link in the chain of maritime operators without being turned on the liability of the other parties. So this still needs to be rectified. We must have a full picture of all parties' responsibilities and hence of their liability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows that, in this area more than any other, we have a tremendous responsibility and we must, it seems to me, stifle any institutional pride we may have.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has responded to this ambition of public opinion by means of a rapid, accelerated procedure, the credit for which must be firmly laid at the door of our four rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs McKenna, Mr Watts et Mr Ortuondo Larrea. We had a common objective. It seems to me that that was the one we had to pursue: to arrive at a text during the December part-session and to achieve a consensus between the Council and Parliament. That is what public opinion was expecting and if, by misfortune, another accident were to happen we would be very severely judged. It turns out that two texts risk putting us at odds with the Council and so, this evening, it is likely that the imminent publication of directives and regulations, which everybody is hoping for, will not be announced.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I regret that, due to over-hastiness, or perhaps due to a lack of level-headedness, these ten days have been cruelly snatched from us, and I also regret that we have not taken the hand extended to us by the Council so that, in December, in ten days to be exact, we might achieve what it seems we are all apparently hoping for throughout this Chamber. Personally, I regret this and I believe that it will be severely judged.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament’s position is the correct one to take on most of these texts, because it is perhaps the most demanding one, except on the issue of double hulls. Mr President, I therefore appeal for the adoption of a common position on the liability scheme of classification societies, the system of banning ships, black boxes and systematic inspections, to tackle what we will doubtless be unable to reach agreement on today. The French Presidency will have given the matter a crucial boost, the effects of which will unfortunately only be felt in two or three months’ time. We are taking any number of risks, including that of conciliation. I believe we will come to regret this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In them, attention has been focused on factors that are essential for increased safety at sea. There is, however, still much to be done to improve safety at sea. It is important to tighten up regulations regarding the control of harbours and ports even further, and enhance its effectiveness. We also have to improve the way we approve classification societies and monitor their work, and expanded inspections must be carried out, in particular on high-risk vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that it is not enough that the Union alone should find solutions to increase safety at sea. For example, questions of responsibility must be dealt with on a global basis. That also goes for the matter of double-hull design requirements. Rules applied regionally are not enough here either: we need global IMO agreements. For example, for Finland it is vitally important that Russia is included in these agreements. We must ensure that vessels that are no longer seaworthy and pose a risk actually are scrapped and are not brought back into service flying someone else’s flag. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the real problem is the political will to adopt and implement measures binding upon all those endangering the community and the environment in order to make a profit. These are not only the shipowners but also, more especially, the contractors, who are large multinationals, as the losses of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> clearly illustrated.</p>
<p class="contents">These binding measures should involve not only the detention of dangerous ships but also the seizure of such vessels and their contents.

The fuel dumps of Total and Shell, the charterers of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> respectively, should have been immediately confiscated until all the damage that had been inflicted due to their irresponsibility had been fully compensated.</p>

<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erika</span> catastrophe in autumn 1999 caused many to react, which is a good thing. At the same time, it would have been even better if we had <span class="italic">acted </span>in advance instead of <span class="italic">reacting</span> afterwards. Then <span class="italic">perhaps</span> we could have avoided a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much that is good in what we must decide on today. That applies both to the stricter requirements on the design of oil tankers, better rules on port state control and the tightening up of the rules on classification societies that will also result from this. At the same time, I feel that many question marks remain. For example, what is the point of preventing vessels from putting into EU ports if we do not prevent them from navigating our waters? Realistic assessments suggest that we will only be able to stop a further 10-12 vessels per year. Will this be sufficient? The latest major accident resulting in oil discharges just a few weeks ago involved a double-hull tanker. This means that not even the mandatory introduction of this type of hull will provide any kind of certain solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take up one further matter, namely all the cases of oil discharges that are not an accident but rather are entirely deliberate discharges. Oil traffic in the Baltic has doubled since 1995 and in a few years’ time will have trebled. Every day we suffer two new discharges on average. A short time ago a vessel with a Maltese flag of convenience discharged oil in Swedish waters just off Gotska Sandön. The vessel then sailed into the port of Tallinn in Estonia. The question is who <span class="italic">can</span> act. Under the MARPOL convention Sweden is not entitled to act because the vessel is no longer in Swedish waters. Neither can Estonia act, because the vessel did not cause any damage there. Malta, for its part, probably does not <span class="italic">wish </span>to act, because the country enjoys great economic gain from this type of vessel being registered under the Maltese flag. And so yet another environmental marauder goes free.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals that we have submitted to date will not solve this problem in the future either. I therefore consider that there is an incredible amount still to do in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to deal with it, we need strict, modern rules with reliable inspectors and suitably-staffed government agencies to ensure that they are applied. Proposals have been made to prohibit ships which seriously endanger our seas from docking, to record voyage data so that conditions along a ship's course can be checked in the event of an accident, to gradually make double hulls compulsory and to improve regulations and standards governing ship inspection and control bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, nothing would be simpler than to set limits and restrictions which, in theory, would preclude any accident. However, they would be impossible to apply without taking other basic aspects of the problem into account. Shipping should not be treated as the "enemy", nor is it. It should be seen as a friend which could do better. We need to take action to improve safety which causes shipping and trade as little pain as possible and we must be sure that such action will not do more harm than good. In other words, we must not exaggerate. I am positive that everyone would rather have more lenient regulations which are applied than stricter regulations which are not applied. May I remind the House that five Member States – and to avoid misunderstanding, Greece is not one of them – have been charged by the Commission with failure to apply the previous, more lenient directive. I think we can strike the required balance on the basis of the Commission and IMO proposals and the reports under discussion, on which the rapporteurs really do deserve to be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy is that, even if regulations are introduced, they will not stop the type of accident in which the Greek car ferry <span class="italic">Express Samina </span>was involved, i.e. where a captain "decides" to ram his ship into charted, well-lit rocks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Immediately after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster the Commissioner started working on an extensive legislation package, and in all honesty, I am compelled to say that apart from the liability aspect, the legislation really was not bad at all. The problem was, and remains, compliance with legislation, inspections and sanctions in the event of non-compliance. Today we are discussing the safety of ships and flag states, port state control and the classification societies. Unfortunately, pressure of time means I have to be selective.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the issue of the classification societies. It does not really matter that they are supposed to have maximum unlimited liability. The majority of them cannot afford it anyway. What is important is to ensure that when they make a serious and inexcusable mistake, they are shut down, i.e. we must close them, put a stop to their activities, end of story. That would keep them on their toes a bit more. It would also seem to be better than imposing sanctions that do not yield anything.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the flag states. I personally am in favour of banning ships that sail under cheap blacklisted flags from the ports and territorial waters of the Union. However I can see the practical difficulties associated with this. Is it not worrying that the sister ship of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, the <span class="italic">Maria S</span>, carried on sailing round undisturbed for more than a year before it was detained and sent to the scrap heap? Why was the <span class="italic">Maria S</span> not taken out of service by its classification society? What did the flag state actually do? Various states, which are completely irresponsible to my mind, offer registrations that take a mere twenty minutes via the Internet. It is in every sense a virtual affair, with no form of inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sanders has already mentioned Cambodia. Cambodia advertises this form of registration in the shipping news. What is the Commissioner doing about ships that have been registered in this manner? Are we going to wait until they are detained? Once, twice, until there is oil on the North Sea beaches. It is obvious that a bonafide company does not register its ships in Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is Honduras. 750 ships were in an unspeakably poor condition even by Honduran standards. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether we follow these ships with a tracking and tracing system? Because surely the question arises as to which flag states <span class="italic">have </span>accepted these floating wrecks? Where are they now? I do not think we can continue to operate with any credibility without a tracking system of this kind. Other countries besides those of the EU must take a firm hand with the flag states. Some of our Member States make a mess of their own registers. A strict test must also be applied under real life conditions to those countries that have systems which look good on paper but which do not amount to anything in reality. If they fail the test then the same rule applies to them as it does to other untrustworthy flag states: we do not want their ships in our ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our past and recent history has been dotted with calamities, and that might also seem quite natural, though upsetting, if we did not remember that 75% of them have been caused by human hand. So it is important to state the political and cultural bottom line: it is time to get rid of the emergency culture, and it is time to affirm the prevention culture. The reports that have been presented are a move in this direction. It is significant that the Commission, through the Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, has this morning confirmed its priority commitment to a modern maritime safety policy, and the declaration made by the Council is also important, but this declaration is binding in respect of the effort that must be made to bring this matter to a definitive close by the end of December.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a good start, but we must also move on to other stages. Some have been announced this morning by the Commissioner, and I shall mention four of them: legislative and organisational harmonisation by the candidate countries for enlargement; training of human resources and recognition of the rights of those working in the sector; the setting-up of a European maritime agency, with the full involvement not only of the Member States, but also of local and regional authorities; and affirmation of the principle of liability, and hence redress, for environmental damage and not just social and economic damage.</p>

This is demonstrated by the fact that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have certainly had some success. Nevertheless, we still unfortunately witness serious incidents, such as the recent sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which show how urgent it is to adopt new measures to promote marine safety and to avoid any repetition of incidents that have such major ecological and economic repercussions on our coastlines, our seas, fisheries and tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who in a very short time have shown how determined our Parliament is to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls and construction standards, and that it is no longer tolerable that similar incidents should occur again. I believe it is our duty to strengthen the enforcement of existing directives on these matters and to adopt new measures designed to clear our seas of sub-standard vessels, real sea-going old rust buckets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to adopting this package of measures, the European Union should, in my view, act in a worldwide context, identifying solutions agreed at international level that will improve maritime safety and at the same time not penalise our shipowners in comparison with others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would highlight the need to set up an information exchange system among the Member States on navigation safety in areas with heavy tanker traffic, so as to ensure constant monitoring and an immediate reaction to any hazards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has the merit of overcoming inactivity and contributing to a political solution. Parliament wants effective and coherent action for the sector. We know that the cause of accidents, which are becoming more numerous and more serious despite the technology now available, lies in the competitive madness in shipbuilding, leading to declining quality, and the absurd economic management of ageing fleets, which hinges on a strategy of drastic cuts in maintenance and crews.</p>
<p class="contents">Accidents are not just caused by the age and type of the vessel; they also occur because of the unscrupulousness of ship owners and operators who make use of every possible method to cut costs. Some of these have been repeatedly mentioned here, from flags of convenience to the permissiveness of port authorities and the complicity of classification societies. The problem of safety for this form of transport requires offenders to be penalised rigorously; imposing such penalties entails costs that must be shared by the whole sector worldwide, so that we do not penalise the European sector even more.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with imposing a lower limit for personal injury or death and material damage, leaving the Member States free to raise these limits. We disagree with the idea according to which the fitness of classification societies depends on their size or even the number of inspectors on their staff, and prefer to be guided by the consequences of their certification, and therefore the system of civil liability compatible with the risk is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a comment on Portugal, which has been mentioned here. Portugal supported the changes to Directive 94/54 but disagrees with the abolition of classification societies by smaller countries. Classification society performance must be assessed by common criteria: number of accidents, incidents or detentions of inspected and certified ships that cause pollution. It is unrealistic to expect the number of accidents to fall without international coordination channelled through a political and entrepreneurial commitment that creates a new operational mentality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tremendous damage has been caused to nature as well as to the livelihoods of the population living in these areas. Our electors ask us what we are doing to prevent catastrophes like these? I would like to thank Ms Wallström and Ms De Palacio for the action they have taken in the field of maritime safety. They definitely have reacted quickly and worked swiftly for better rules and legislation regarding safety at sea in both the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The phasing out of single-hull oil tankers will increase safety along EU coasts. My friends in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism remarked that stricter EU phase-out dates should be adopted. I thank my colleagues for this responsible approach and I urge agreement to be reached on the earlier drop-dead date of 2015. When we do this we should always remember that double hulls or even triple hulls do not guarantee with absolute certainty that accidents will not happen in the future. Presenting new technologies and making improvements to the vessel design are part of this important work.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission decision yesterday to stick with the previously agreed timetable regarding the state aid schemes I think that was a wise decision.

It is enough to confuse anybody! Our citizens understand even less well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our reports contain a weakness, in that they do not sufficiently discuss the seafarers and the men on board ship. More than 80 of accidents are associated with human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social in nature. Naturally, the training of the crews is important, but it must be checked and this can only be carried out by the port state. Inspectors must check not only the condition of the ship but also the shipboard social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Is Convention 147 of the ILO which, amongst other things, obliges port states to reinforce measures aimed at protecting the interests of seamen in terms of their health and safety, their working conditions and their union rights, being correctly enforced? As for the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, I believe it would be useful to amend it in such a way as to make inspections of the shipboard social conditions systematic and effective.

From the very first meeting, under the French Presidency of the Council of Transport Ministers, there has been a common will to so something. Today, as well as moving forward the date of the debate in part-session, the European Parliament is proposing to debate and to give its verdict in three key areas. This specifically demonstrates that, this time, we will not fall once again into the ruts of the past. It has to be said that in the twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz accident some things were perhaps achieved, but not enough to prevent this lack of maritime safety from being eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight the work that has been done at this level and I share the opinion of your rapporteurs, the quality of whose work I also commend. I am convinced, as are the Members of the European Parliament, that we must strengthen the texts proposed by the Commission, especially regarding black boxes and banning ships. I am also in favour of the liability of all operators, in particular that of classification societies, which play a key role in maritime safety, being established and clearly reinforced so that no lenience can exist, most notably as regards inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that the Council is not seeking a compromise. We must move forward towards consensus upon maximum maritime regulation and safety. It is not a question of a compromise between those who would like more and those who would like less. There is common ground and we must seek the consensus to achieve it. As regards maritime safety and ‘cheating’ there is no compromise to be sought regarding the elements of inspection and maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">If you agree, Parliament, the Commission and the Council must work, by consensus, between now and the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December. I have indeed heard this suggestion made by several rapporteurs. This is the proposal I am putting to you officially right now. I hope that this work can result in common positions being established as early as 20 and 21 December. I am not yet at a stage where I need to talk about conciliation. We can expedite matters. If we work from now until the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December, we will succeed in establishing common positions, obtained by qualified majority voting. This is an element I wish to stress as Parliament will then be able to accept these positions in second reading early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the subjects we are dealing with are sometimes complex and technical. I realise that even the translations take time. But the most important thing is the unshakeable will which must motivate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to establish maritime safety. These proposals which, I hope, we are going to push forward together very quickly, both as regards the phasing out of single-hull ships and the issue of classification societies and port state control, are important, but, as you have said, and as the Commissioner has also said, we know that they are not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this second package in order to go further in terms of making all the operators aware of their responsibilities. We also need to step up surveillance and transparency. One Member of Parliament used the term ‘traceability’. I would support that idea. We cannot allow operators to do just what they like with ships, especially when they have been repaired or banned in such and such a place. We must not find them back on our seas and on our oceans. The Equasis system, which is part of the second package, will enable us to push things forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, a number of you have spoken about this, but we do not as yet have all the elements of the inquiry that I set up in the wake of the loss of the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>. The fact is that this ship was not old, it had a double hull and its crew was from Europe. We will get the results of this inquiry shortly. It is important that everybody knows what happened, as the human question, which was brought up by a number of you, is also very important. Things are happening in terms of the overexploitation of seamen and shipboard living and working conditions, as well as in terms of maintenance, which may be determining factors in the cause of accidents, and I believe we must move forward in this area too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I first would like to thank you all for this interesting and valuable debate. I am glad to say that the Commission will support many of the amendments put forward in these three reports. There still remain some areas where we have somewhat different approaches. But I hope that these can be cleared today. Allow me to give the Commission’s view on each of the reports on the three proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start with the proposal on port state control. I thank Parliament for its strong commitment to our proposal and especially Mr Watts for his series of amendments which sends a clear and strong message to sub-standard operators and negligent flag states. Most of the amendments are focused on the proposed refusal of access to Community waters. These are Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8. The core of Parliament’s amendments is Amendment No 3, amending Article 7a of the Commission proposal. It includes three elements: firstly, the deletion of the age criterion is acceptable to the Commission since there is no absolute correlation between age and the quality of a ship. Secondly, regarding the criterion based on the absence of a black box on board, the Commission supports the principle of a widened accelerated introduction of black boxes on board ships plying EU ports, but this is a matter which should not be dealt with in the port state control Directive. So this is not a matter of principle but a matter of the formal place for this specific proposal. The port state control Directive is designed to check compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules. Within a few days the Commission will adopt a proposal for a Directive on safety of navigation including such an obligation to be equipped with a black box.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element of Amendment No 3 is a proposal to ban all ships that have flown for three years the flag of a state included in the blacklist published by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding. In Parliament’s proposal, this criterion alone would be decisive to ban whole fleets. Should the directive enter into force today with the proposed amendment of Parliament, 32 fleets including Malta, Cyprus, Russia, Panama, the largest fleet of the world, would be banned. This means thousands of ships including ships of high quality which is contrary to the objectives of port state control. We prefer our proposal where the flag criterion is linked to the detention record of a ship so as to give a clear and strong signal to sub-standard operators. In brief, the Commission can only partially accept Amendment No 3.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7 and 8 also relate to the refusal of access. The Commission can accept Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8, but can only partially accept Amendment No 1. The deletion of the age criterion is acceptable but not the extension of banning the territorial waters of Member States. This is not reflected in the text of the directive where the refusal of access only concerns EU ports.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other amendments, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 21, 22, 23 and 24 subject to some redrafting. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 to 20, Amendment Nos 25 and 26. Most are new proposed recitals that do not reflect the contents of the directive. Many are either outside the scope of the port state control or are already covered by this or another directive. More specifically, Amendments Nos 9 to 17 and 25 introduce new recitals most of which are not linked in any way to the text of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 18 introduces port state control in relation to the seafarers’ rest period, however the enforcement of the provisions in respect of seafarers’ hours of work is already fully covered by existing Directive 99/95. Amendment No 19 is redundant since the current procedures already provide that non-compliance with the required health and working standards as established by ILO conventions are reported as deficiencies and can also lead to the detention of a vessel. Amendment No 20 is irrelevant to port state control as it concerns competition between ports of the Atlantic and North Sea and not maritime safety. Amendment No 26 reflects the amendments of banding proposed by the rapporteur in Amendment No 3 but extends the scope of the measure to the exclusive economic zone of Member States and in this light it is contrary to the law of the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the proposal for the accelerated phasing in of double-hull oil tankers. I am happy to say that we almost entirely agree. Following pressure by Member States on the International Maritime Organisation, there is a proposed phase-out schedule which meets the main concerns of Europe and at the same time aligns with the American Oil Pollution Act 90 and which is to be fully supported. In this respect, the Commission insists on 2015 as the final end date. In order to achieve the main objective of this proposal, namely to phase out old single-hull oil tankers quickly, we are prepared to go along with the deletion of the proposed financial incentive system setting up differential charging of port and pilotage dues. It is expected that the IMO will formally adopt the phase out schedule at its April meeting next year. However, should the International Maritime Organisation fail to do so, the Commission agrees with Parliament that we will have to adopt a EU regulation based on the EP text and introduce a system for European Union waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 of the report says exactly the same, but it is more of a political commitment than a legal text. Therefore, we do not need it in the final text and I hope you will not insist on this point. For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept the new Amendment No 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation. The Commission also rejects Amendments Nos 10 and 18 since this would mean setting up an additional committee just for this regulation and this is inconsistent with our policy line of reducing the number of committees by making use of existing committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21 to the condition assessment scheme and we agree with the main thrust of the approach suggested but there is need for some fine tuning of the wording to make it clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the proposal for amendments to the classification societies Directive. Here again, there is no great divergence of views and the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 6, 12, 14, 15 and 8 with the exception of the additional Paragraphs 3a and 3b to that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a set of amendments which the Commission feels could create confusion because they introduce new terminology in an area where the language of the international fora, IMO, is well established. I am referring to Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7 and 9 and the Commission feels that these are not really substantial problems, more drafting language matters which could possibly be cleared by the jurist-linguists.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of assessments to be carried out over the classification societies by the Member States on the one hand and by the Commission on the other is of primary importance. The objectives of Parliament and the Commission are the same. We must maintain the clear difference in substance of the tasks at hand for either party. Member States must satisfy themselves that the classification society they have chosen to work on their behalf, fulfils the tasks to their full satisfaction. The Commission’s task is to confirm that the classification society continues to meet the qualitative criteria in the directive and to monitor the performance of the classification societies. In that respect, the control tasks of Member States and the Commission are different and should not be undertaken at the same time. This is why the Commission would favour Amendment No 28 now on the table which reintroduces the obligation for Member States to carry out their assessment and therefore rejects Amendment No 13.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethics is an equally important issue that should be tackled. I share Parliament’s concern that there should be no undue influence from a shipowner over a classification society. In this respect, Amendments Nos 26 and 29 are making clarifications of the text in their Spanish versions and would be acceptable to the Commission. Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point “K” are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some other amendments which the Commission has difficulties in accepting mainly on the grounds that we feel that the concerns expressed have already been sufficiently taken care of in other parts of the existing text. Here I have in mind Amendments Nos 5, 16 and the additions 3a and 3b to Amendment No 8: 3a because we feel this is adequately covered in Article 9 and 10 and 3b because this is covered in the Directive on port state control.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, Amendment No 1 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point “K” are not acceptable on legal grounds. Amendment No 1 because only the Community is a legal person and not the Union and 18 “K” as it may contravene horizontal commitments made in the general agreement on trade in services. Amendment No 11 and a part of Amendment No 18 relating to point “H” which deal with the issue of setting clear performance targets and indicators for classification societies are rather ambiguous. They seem to suggest limitations which are unacceptable and should be rejected. The aim of our proposal is to allow for a tightening of supervision of classification societies and the possibility to suspend or withdraw recognition in situations where the performance of a classification society is not up to standard. In this respect, the Commission cannot accept any limitation or involvement of classification societies in the judgment over themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendments Nos 19 to 25, I am afraid none of them is acceptable either because they are already covered in the existing directive or simply fall outside the scope of this directive and are covered by other directives.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves Amendment No 10 dealing with the important issue of liability limits. The Commission appreciates the support for its originally proposed limit. Also, the Commission agrees with the revision clause but would prefer the more flexible formula suggested in Amendment No 12, commitology, over that in Amendment No 10, full legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments on issues raised by Mr Stenmarck about oil spills in the Baltic Sea. We have two instruments at hand. Firstly there is a Directive on waste reception facilities recently approved by the European Parliament and Council. All ships are obliged to discharge waste in European Union ports. Secondly, in our proposal on ‘Erika II’ concerning surveillance of navigation, Member States will be required to intervene even on the high seas in such cases. I would say to Mrs Peijs about Cambodia and Honduras ships, that we are perfectly aware of the threat to safety and these are precisely the kinds of flags targeted in our proposal on the port state Directive. I can assure you that if a shipowner thinks of registering a ship on these registers, he should think twice after our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">May I conclude by expressing once again my gratitude to Parliament and to the four rapporteurs for their expeditious work and excellent reports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a curious coincidence that Parliament is considering the final stage of the adoption of the European Parliament and Council decision on accidental or deliberate marine pollution, at the same time as the first set of measures proposed by the Commission following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster. Indeed, even with the best preventative legislation, zero risk does not exist. We are sometimes struggling against the forces of nature. In order to be better prepared against maritime disasters, this decision has established a solid framework for cooperation at Community level. It creates the conditions that will allow the sharing of experience gathered by Member States to better protect our marine environment against the risk of accidental or deliberate pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation process was demanding, but a well-balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of Parliament and Council have produced a better decision. The scope and content of the decision are now clearer, in particular concerning operational discharges and munitions as well as regarding the link with international conventions or in relation to the polluter-pays principle. This has largely been due to the excellent work of the European Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, whom I would particularly like to thank along with the Members of Parliament’s delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by recalling that one month ago the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> sank near Cherbourg with 6 000 tonnes of dangerous cargo. Once again, this demonstrates how urgent the adoption of strengthened, preventative and restoratory Community measures for the protection of our seas is. We now count on the Council and, of course, Mr Gayssot personally to crown this remarkable work with our good, solid, ambitious agreement during the next Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
