<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Today the Commission has adopted a communication entitled "Supporting national strategies for safe and sustainable pensions through an integrated approach". This communication is a proposal on specific objectives and working methods for cooperation in the field of pension reforms in accordance with the method of open coordination as decided upon in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past two years there has been a significant change in attitudes towards European cooperation, particularly in the social field. We can see a change in the attitude of those who are in charge of the national protection policies. They are now agreed in calling for an open method of coordination to be applied to pensions in the long-term future.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal puts this forward as a "soft" type of policy-making at European level, that is "soft" compared with legislation or with existing policies. I refer, in particular, to the coordination of economic policies. It is very clear in this communication that the new open method does not replace the existing methods. This proposal does not take away the national responsibilities of the national policy-makers. The ambition of this communication is to promote the development of an integrated approach to the challenges imposed by ageing and societal changes in the pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the content of this communication? There are three main axes: the first one concerns the adequacy of pensions. The second one concerns financial sustainability, and the third one, the modernisation of the pension systems in response to societal change. I will expand on each of these axes.</p>
<p class="contents">Adequacy describes the fundamental social goals of pension systems in order to prevent social exclusion of older people and to give them the opportunity to maintain their living standard in old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Second is financial sustainability. In order to be achieved in a spirit of intergovernmental and intra-generational fairness throughout, this requires a high level of employment, respect for the growth and stability pact and a good regulatory framework for the private systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The third axis concerns the modernisation of pension systems. According to this axis the pension systems have to be more compatible with the need for more flexible workforces. That means that they have to meet the needs of the new models of working organisation; they have to meet the needs of less stable families and of greater equality between men and women. It should also make them more transparent, predictable and adaptable to changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the heading of these three axes there are ten concrete objectives. We – and the Social Protection Committee, which has done excellent work – are going to measure these objectives by means of indicators. It is because of the Social Protection Committee that we have an analysis of all pension systems and the reforms that have taken place in all Member States. The Social Protection Committee, then, is working on the economic and social indicators. Next year we are going to adopt these indicators in order to measure the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the proposed procedure? How the Member States meet the particular objectives is up to them and depends on national strategies. The communication suggests that the Member States should submit these first national strategies by the end of summer 2002. There will be a first joint monitoring procedure during the 2003 spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This report on the national strategies will be based on an integrated approach, and, politically, this is the most important element of the communication. It will be necessary to take into account, not only pension reforms in a narrow sense, but also employment policy and the management of public finances. In order to prepare these strategies, different governmental departments will have to participate and, of course, the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have an integrated approach? The need for this is based on an understanding of the interaction between pensions and other policy areas. Employment strategy is one example. A successful employment strategy makes it easier to finance pensions, but pension reforms can create employment incentives. A second example is public finances. Consolidating public finances today makes it easier to cope with the budgetary impact of ageing tomorrow, but insufficient control of pension expenditure could destabilise public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is close cooperation between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. They are going to present a joint report and their contribution is crucial, but the European Parliament can play an important role in this process. We wish to have your opinion on this communication and, in particular, the objectives proposed. As the Commission and the Belgian presidency are keen on making good progress in time for the next European Council, we would be grateful if you could give this opinion before October.</p>
<p class="contents">The more informal regular contacts between the European Parliament and the Social Protection Committee will also continue on a regular basis. Some other modalities of cooperation may also be discussed, and I am open to any suggestions from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is politically very important that the Member States are keen on this cooperation in the field of pension reform. This is one of the most sensitive and difficult reforms in all Member States and that is why it is of great political importance. We believe that with this cooperation, between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States, we can establish a comprehensive approach. This will be useful to the Member States and help implementation of the reforms.</p>

I think, in fact, that some splendid things were put forward in connection with the Göteborg Summit, and I also think that the work which has now been done on the reports from the individual countries shows that it is only right to broaden the agenda. We must not just talk about the growing burden of the elderly and the economic consequences, but also about how we obtain a good pension system. I also think, however, that it is important that this work should not just remain work done behind closed doors between politicians, officials and experts. Moreover, I should like to ask the Commissioner what plans she has to put some impetus into a broader public debate about this coordination of pensions made to run in parallel. The open method must be open in the true sense of the word, so that the public is also involved. What will the Commissioner do? Will she give an undertaking that more efforts will be made to increase public…</p>

I look forward to reading the communication. It is one of the most important debates we need to have.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of questions. There is indeed a major demographic shift under way within the Union, and we must try to ensure that we retain older people in the labour market. However, there is a big problem: those older people will be the people with outdated skills. Does the Commissioner agree that this will lead to the revolution we have been pressing for, with a shift away from a concentration on initial education and training towards continuing training and lifelong learning? This will become essential.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some contradictions and difficulties: for example, there is a tendency everywhere in the Union to raise retirement ages, and yet at the same time there are widespread public subsidies for early retirement. Is there not a danger that the finger of blame will be pointed at the Union, because these difficult issues are being forced upon Member States for decision at this stage? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the transparency of the pension systems. One of the objectives of the third axis in the modernisation of pension systems is to make them transparent. This means that information must be clear and readily available not only to EU citizens but also to third-country nationals. There are major problems in this area at present. In order to achieve the degree of transparency aimed at, we need some kind of indicators. Clear information should be available on demand. We cannot impose the reform structure or the structure of pension systems on Member States, but we can measure it with a series of indicators. Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more details on this at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the issue of lifelong learning and the problem of early retirement. There is a clear link between the age limit and the need of active ageing. The majority of Member States have an age limit of 65, but this is not the rule, it is the exception. There are many different early retirement systems in place in all Member States which have caused many problems regarding the financial sustainability of the pension systems. That is why we propose this combination of policies: on the one hand, we propose the reform of the pension system and a change in the age limit, on the other hand, we propose policies for activating ageing populations, i.e. incentives for retaining older people in the labour market, incentives for training and, in some cases, subsidies for establishing an SME or other undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">So I very much agree with you, we need this integrated approach. We cannot just decide to increase the age limit, we must implement other policies at the same time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the Belgian presidency should be very grateful for your contribution to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you two questions. The first one concerns the objectives included in the document. I note that the ten objectives which we adopted from the original statement have been whittled down to three. Although there are three key objectives – and that might benefit clarity – in my opinion, a number of crucial elements have fallen by the wayside, such as solidarity between generations and solidarity within one generation. Another aspect which I miss is the link between the pension pillars. What are the roles of the first, second and third pillars? Those are questions which are no longer addressed here. How does the Commissioner intend to include problems of this kind in the debate at this stage?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you were right in calling for a global approach. Göteborg has stated that the agreements must be included in the wider economic guidelines. That has not been provided for in the plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the young generation of Europe is concerned, this is perhaps the largest challenge we will see in the field of economic and social policy in the decades ahead. Open coordination is naturally a positive thing and I warmly support it. It is good that the Commission is now looking for indicators and also seeking to increase public debate on this very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">My real question concerns whether, however, you see any opportunities for slightly stronger measures, in other words in the future could we also highlight questions of pension policy, for example, in slightly more binding documents such as Stability and Growth Agreements and employment policy guidelines, and, for example, issue warnings to those Member States who are not managing their pension policy properly and ensure that, in the future, through reasonable funding, we will be able to pay sustainable, good pensions to the pensioners of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even Mr Fatuzzo, the pensioners' representative, is well pleased. And indeed, what we have heard is impressive. Of course, from what I have read in the press, you have taken these initiatives in the teeth of opposition from numerous members of the Commission, who consider them somewhat progressive. The point is: with Article 140 talking of a high level of protection, what can reform mean if it does not maintain a high level of protection?</p>
<p class="contents">But, mainly, I wanted to raise two questions. We talk of decent pensions through complementary pillars. So far so good. But have you checked if this complementarity can be applied to the entire pyramid of workers, and especially to small and medium-sized enterprises and low incomes, or do we need to take a different approach here? Secondly, as the objective is not just sustainable pensions, but decent sustainable pensions, should we not look at what margins will be earmarked for pensions from increases in the gross domestic product? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, one of these objectives is the one you referred to, i.e. the inter-generational balance. There will be many more indicators, including indicators on the economic and social dimension. They will, of course, be the subject of discussion in both the Commission and the Council and, as you know, the Social Protection Committee and Parliament are in constant communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the role of the guidelines on employment are concerned, I did not quite understand your question. If what you meant was that some of these objectives should be included in the guidelines on employment, I should tell you that the first cycle of the employment strategy will end next year during the Spanish presidency, when the five-year period expires. We shall see how we can take the issue of quality or issues relating to older workers into account at the changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of decent pensions and the role of the three pillars is concerned, it is very difficult, in fact I would say it is impossible for the Commission to issue specific guidelines on the role of the three pillars in each country. But what is clear is that we need to safeguard decent pensions, which is why the role of the first pillar is very important. And, of course, there is always a link between an increase in the gross national product and support for the first pillar, subject to the principles governing the stability and growth pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is splendid, and the Commission is right in what it says. As you said in your proposal, Commissioner, it is very important that the Member States should be committed to the plans you have now put forward. Unfortunately, I can already foresee aspects of the debate that will take place in my own Member State when the Commission begins discussing pensions. It would therefore be very interesting, Commissioner, if, today, you could unambiguously confirm the impression I receive when I read your communication, namely that the Commission is not in any way out to undermine existing pensions in the Member States or to harmonise pension arrangements in the Member States. I assume that you will confirm this, and I believe that doing so will be incredibly important in the forthcoming debate in our respective Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to the Member States to make the public aware of the problem, given that the extent of the problem varies from one Member State to another. But I think that the very fact that this discussion has started at European level and that we have agreed to work together on this problem, which now has European dimensions, is important from the point of view of public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the second question is concerned, first: these reports cannot be annual reports and they will cover longer periods of time. Secondly, the statistics which the European Commission uses are Eurostat statistics and statistics from the national statistics offices, which receive huge financial support, with the Commission and governments working together to ensure that they all operate to the same standards. Because I agree with you that not all the national statistics offices are performing as well as they should, there are a lot of lacunae and there are a lot of statistics which are not reliable. So what we are trying to do is to support the national structures so that they operate to the same standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question concerns the question of harmonised pensions. I think that I really need to be categorical and absolute here. There is no question, no question whatsoever of harmonising pension systems, both for political reasons, because there is no legal basis for such a move, and for technical reasons, given that it is quite impossible for us to homogenise or harmonise systems which have different structures, different funding methods and which often operate in very differently organised economies. I refer, of course, to the example of Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">But what we do need to highlight is the fact that, although there are different structures, there are common problems which have to do with the demographic problem, with new forms of employment which have to be taken into account, with the question of unemployment and with the question of new family structures. These are problems common to all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have common objectives. The common objectives are sustainable pensions, the financial sustainability of pensions, both state and private, and the modernisation of pensions, as I set out in my initial intervention. Common grounds and common objectives bring about a form of collaboration in which everyone keeps their particular structures and quirks but collaborates within an overall framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
