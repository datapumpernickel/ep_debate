<p class="contents">This accident highlighted, in particular, the urgent need to adopt the measures presented by the Commission following another similar accident involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. Some weeks after the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, therefore, the Commission sent the European Parliament and the Council a new Regulation introducing three urgent measures into current legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, an immediate ban on the transport of heavy oil grades in single-hull oil tankers bound for or leaving ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a revision of the scheme for an accelerated phasing out of single-hull oil tankers, by reducing the maximum permitted age of vessels and bringing forward the deadlines for abolishment with regard to those originally proposed by the measures in the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> package, in order to increase protection of the marine environment, thereby incorporating the Commission’s original proposals in the so-called <span class="italic">Erika I</span> package.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a more general application of the special inspection regime for oil tankers, in order to assess the structural integrity of single-hull vessels over fifteen years old. All this means that the new Regulation aims to change the current situation radically, making it obligatory to transport fuels with the highest pollution risk in safer vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of the new system, the European Union intends to apply legislation as stringent as that applied in the US since 1992 following the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> disaster. Lastly, this legislation increases technical inspections of oil tankers that have not yet reached the maximum age limit. All single-hull oil tankers, including small vessels – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would emphasise this point – that were initially exempt, will now, as of fifteen years of age, have to comply with condition assessment schemes (CAS). Vessels that fail the strict inspection controls will be immediately held in any port of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, in March the Ministers for Transport reached a unanimous policy agreement concerning these measures. Examination by the Council made it possible to introduce a number of amendments that improved the initial proposal. For example, the Regulation now comprises a clearer definition of what is meant by heavy oil grades, for the purposes of applying the bans contained in the proposal. The definition is based on technical parameters that are well known to the sector and the authorities will have no difficulty in applying it.</p>
<p class="contents">Account is also taken of the situation of the fleet of small oil tankers operating in our ports, islands and coasts, which requires an additional adaptation period, but which should also be the subject of adaptation and improvement in terms of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency, and in particular the Minister for the Merchant Navy, Mr Anomeritis, for its excellent work throughout this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the key points of our proposal. Its final objective is, as we have repeated many times, to prevent another <span class="italic">Erika</span>, another <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, another <span class="italic">Aegean Sea</span>, another <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span>, or any other disaster of this kind in our waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, after all, self-evident that, after the accidents involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika, </span>something had to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to transporting oil, we are giving old, unsafe, and dangerous ships no more chances. At the same time, Parliament and the Council are directing that bulk shipments may now be transported from and into EU ports only in double hull tankers. By combining these factors, which I see as the most important – heavy oil into and out of European ports from now on only in double hull tankers – and by significantly speeding up the scrapping of the old single hull tankers, we are making the sea and European waters safer to a substantial degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a few months have elapsed between the Commission’s initiative and the first reading here in Parliament, and this first reading will also be the last, as that is what has been agreed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, who have, so to speak, taken a united approach. For that reason I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for playing their part in this process, as well as to the Greek Presidency, which – as Commissioner De Palacio has already mentioned – has gone to a great deal of trouble, and also to the Commission, for doing such a good job of bringing the Council and Parliament together so promptly to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">This fast-track procedure was possible because the political will to find a consensus was there and – for we have to be honest – because the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>disaster made the need for action even more pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make the following points about the preferred timescale for scrapping. Single hull tankers in category 1, that is, ships built before 1982, may not be operated for longer than 23 years and must be taken out of service by 2005 at the latest. Single hull tankers in categories 2 and 3, built between 1982 and 1996, may be operated until 2010 at the latest. In this, the Council and Parliament have gone even further than the Commission, but I think that there is justification for putting categories 2 and 3 together, as there is no difference between them apart from their tonnages. Small tankers between 600 and 5 000 tonnes are rightly included as regards the carrying of heavy oil, and here too we have reached a compromise, as, in view of their small number and in order to maintain supplies, we have agreed on 2008, which means that, from that date onwards, only small double hull tankers will be able to be used to transport heavy oil.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would like to emphasise the international dimension. We know, of course, that shipping is international, and that European rules on their own cannot cover everything. Without European rules, though, we would make no real headway through the International Maritime Organisation, which is very heavy going, and so it is a good thing that the IMO is holding a conference on this subject at the end of this year, at which the Commission and the Council will attempt to have European rules made applicable internationally, in doing which they have Parliament’s full support. It is also, of course, the case that double hull tankers on their own are not the safety factor on which everything depends. Other safety factors include port State control, the way in which a ship is maintained, a well-trained crew, and good navigation, often also with the help of pilots in difficult waters. The oil industry’s argument, as set out in the 'Neue Zürcher Zeitung', that a well-maintained old single hull tanker with a good crew could be much safer than a sloppily-maintained double hull tanker with a sub-standard crew, may well have some truth to it, but it is hypocritical and somewhat stupid. Nobody, after all, asserts that a fifty-year old car is worse than a brand-new Rolls-Royce whose brakes work and whose driver doesn’t fall asleep. For the oil industry to adduce such an argument is pretty dubious. We, on the contrary, agree that it is a combination of diverse factors that makes a ship safer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address a couple more aspects. A Chinese freighter has sunk off the Swedish coast, and oil is leaking from it – 400 tonnes of it so far. That is why we will, in future, also need rules covering how fuel and engine oil are to be made safer even on double hull tankers. Old ships are to be taken out of service, and must be safely disposed of. If that is to be done in an environmentally friendly way, that cannot mean scuppering them somewhere in the South Seas.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that Europe has a particular need for new and better ships, which – in view of the dumping that demonstrably goes on – must, for God’s sake, not all be built in Korea. Whilst this is not a discussion about subsidies, the Commission and the Council do need to come up with imaginative initiatives on this, for the building of better ships in European shipyards certainly makes more economic sense than what happened on the coast of Galicia.</p>

We had three proposed amendments. Two of them are largely accepted in Mr Piecyk's report. One concerned the question of ice-breaking ships carrying fuel in the Baltic. The other was the question of the 600 to 5 000 tonne tankers which we were concerned would not be available. We wanted a five-year waiting period to 2008. The period will be more or less five years so we will go along with that.</p>
<p class="contents">We were surprised at this figure of 25.7 API that was pulled out for the definition of heavy crude oil. The generally recognised international level between intermediate and heavy is 22 API. We cannot understand why that, as we proposed, was not an acceptable level. I understand the Council has also gone for this figure of 25.7, which will probably cause certain troubles, especially in the North Sea oil fields. Be that as it may.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this will not avoid the next spillage of oil. Until we can get the IMO on board with these sorts of standards we will still get <span class="italic">Prestige</span>s leaving a non-EU port, plying past the EU to a non-EU port with a non-EU flag. Those are the problems we have to face. We really must get the IMO to come to terms with these standards. Also, we must have a scheme to help with the transition from the single-hulled tankers to the double-hulled, especially in the 600 to 5 000 tonne level. A scrapping and building assistance system must be set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The week before the Prestige accident, my party and I organised a conference on maritime safety in the Bay of Finland, that is to say on precisely those issues referred to by, for example, Mr Purvis. You can appreciate my feelings when I then suspected, and was finally able to have it confirmed, where the Prestige actually came from, and understood that the situation could have been precisely the same in the Bay of Finland as off the coast of Galicia. At the same time, we know that we can presumably expect the amount of traffic through the Baltic to increase tenfold.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been closely involved in this issue. We are also trying to improve Parliament’s reputation. We perhaps had something to hide where the Erika package was concerned. The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also emphasises the importance of neighbouring countries’ subscribing to the same rules because, as Mr Purvis also pointed out, these tankers sail close to our coasts, even if they do not put into EU harbours.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the proposal for having 2010 as the final phasing-out year, a proposal that the Council had come up with and that we are now prepared to agree upon. We also propose that the inspection requirements be looked at. We should have liked to have seen the inspection requirements apply irrespective of age. We are now talking about 15 year-old vessels, but it is important for a vessel, irrespective of age, to be of a good class and standard and to be well maintained. Our experience shows that what the EU has agreed upon is in fact translated into the rules of the IMO. We saw this most recently in connection with the oil fund.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me is why we have not at this stage been able to adopt the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that there be a paragraph stating that we must demand ice-strengthening. I want to ask the Commissioner why the Commission has set its face against our adding a paragraph introducing ice-strengthening requirements, in addition to the requirements for single hull vessels to be phased out and double hull vessels phased in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus on two points, firstly legislation. It is true that Europe has adopted a large number of measures, but it is equally true that public opinion is currently increasingly doubtful that they are being implemented. Over and above this report on double hulls – we must not, in any case, allow the examples it quotes by way of illustration to mislead us as to the impact, for we know very well that double hulls will not remove all maritime risks and that there is no such thing as zero risk – we believe that it is extremely important that the European Union ensures that the Erika I and Erika II packages are actually being enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I have to say to the Commissioner that I compiled a detailed account for the port of Bordeaux last year, after the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, that is. Eight old tubs featuring on the European blacklist entered the port without the French maritime authorities being able to confirm that they had been properly controlled. I suppose that what happened on a small scale in this minor port is representative of a much larger scale situation across Europe and, in my view, what our citizens now want is for Europe to make the Member States directly responsible, as directly responsible as possible, for we know that they are not all progressing at the same rate and that some are more willing to cooperate than others</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns reparation for damage linked to disasters such as that of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. I have to tell you, Commissioner, that there is great disillusionment in France. The IOPCF is providing no more than 15% and the Structural Funds will not contribute any more than what is provided for under the FIFG. In my opinion, this will do a great deal of harm to the image of the European Union as a whole and to the image of the Commission, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, again with regard to reparation for damage, we would like to receive accurate information on the progress made in dealing with the wreck and on what is likely to happen in the future. Are we facing chronic pollution, which will last for years, or is a solution emerging? There has been no response from the authorities for some months now. We need accurate information and we must, if possible, reassure our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is sad that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident proved necessary for us to take action once more, and to finally convince the Council that we have to make policy together and that it was necessary to strengthen the <span class="italic">Erika</span> packages with the present measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have another two amendments, which concern the Annex to this proposal. Firstly, as a liberal, I do not like to see a discussion on State aid to the shipping sector in an important proposal such as this. I recognise that action is badly needed, preferably through the WTO, to put an end to the dumping of ships on the world market by countries in the Far East. I hope that the European Commission also appreciates the necessity of this. I firmly believe in the strength of the European shipbuilding sector, however. Short-term aid does not seem to me to be efficient. I think that my own amendment concerning recital 7a is a good supplement to the otherwise excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">My second amendment expresses the great responsibility that I feel regarding the consequences of the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers by this EU policy. I firmly believe that this must be accompanied by binding rules requiring all EU shipowners and all EU flag State ships to actively scrap phased-out tankers in a responsible manner. In the case of cars we have an end-of-life vehicle directive. I think that something like that must also apply here. In short, see recital 5a. Storing surplus oil tankers on the coast of Bangladesh and India causes greater disasters and has greater consequences than the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, and that was terrible enough.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already initiatives enabling the commercial scrapping, on market terms, of ships in Europe in an environmentally responsible manner. This is waste management. The practice of disposing of ships out at sea and the rotten scrapping of these in poor regions must be a thing of the past. I hope, therefore, that double hull tankers will in future really be safer, partly also as a result of port State controls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to say, however, that it has been a long time in coming, since we have already endured the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>disaster, which happened when the ship should no longer have been at sea according to the terms of the Commission’s initial proposals. The measure is overdue and falls well short of what is required. The Union should adopt political and legislative measures to ban single hull ships carrying dangerous goods such as petroleum derivatives from sailing anywhere in waters under European Union economic control, and not just ban such ships from entering Community ports and using Community anchorages, as the Regulation does.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like, furthermore, to see ‘sensitive coastal areas’ defined in this Regulation, and entry to them restricted for oil tankers posing a particular risk. In any case, we must be aware – and the blame lies with certain Member States of the European Union and with this House – that, over and above the proposals for double hulls, which we support, there are no political and legislative measures either in place or envisaged capable of preventing a fresh disaster if a new <span class="italic">Prestige </span>case were to occur. We Galicians are vividly and painfully aware of this fact. After this Regulation, and even in spite of it, a new <span class="italic">Prestige </span>may once again sail off the shores of Galicia and other affected countries; there is no law to prevent it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, in its Resolution of November 2002 and following the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>oil tanker off the Galician coast, Parliament called for the Council and the Member States to speed up the application of the measures adopted within the context of the <span class="italic">Erika I </span>and <span class="italic">Erika II </span>packages, such as the introduction of double hull vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the draft Regulation presented to us by the Commissioner, but we still feel that the gradual introduction of double hull vessels by the Union is an insufficient, if necessary, measure.</p>
<p class="contents">So far nobody has explained to us the percentage reduction in maritime accidents depending on whether the vessel is single or double hulled. Nor has anyone explained what percentage of vessels involved in serious maritime accidents recently had double hulls.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe this is a good thing and we are prepared to support the Commissioner in her personal crusade, but we do not want to fail to see the wood for the trees and we do not believe that double hulls are the solution. If only they were, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Although they are not the solution, we do feel they offer advantages which, in our opinion, have not been emphasised enough. Two such advantages are that double hulls force us to assess the condition of our fleet and also force us to renew it.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing maritime safety involves financial costs. That is another matter that we feel is somewhat lacking in the Commission proposal – a little more clarity with regard to funding. We still think, however, that, although age affects the general condition of a vessel, all the experts emphasise that maintenance is a better determining factor than age.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many European citizens who have approached us, therefore, we believe that double hulls will only be effective if accompanied by the corresponding investment in improving the current system of inspections and penalties, which obliges vessels’ owners to invest in their maintenance and in improving the social aspect in this sector, as we sometimes have the impression that the Commission would like to tiptoe around this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I would pass on to the Commissioner the question on everyone’s lips: why, in disasters relating to the maritime transport of fuel, are the regions worst struck by this kind of tragedy those that are most closely linked to the sea, relying on commercial, fishing and naval construction ports? In both Brittany and Galicia the shipyards have all but vanished, leading to industrial desertification of entire areas, and yet, the way things are, it does not seem as though these shipyards are going to benefit most from this Regulation. Korean shipyards, which are more competitive and have no problems regarding compatibility and State aid, will benefit most.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that public opinion has the impression that the Commission is being inconsistent. Yes to double hulls, therefore, but only if the requirements and quality of renovated vessels comply with European construction quality standards, environmental standards, social standards and quality standards. I would also ask whether Korea meets these requirements, which are increasingly compulsory for our European citizens. What is a dirty vessel? Will we find, due to the application of this Regulation, some recently built dirty vessels with double hulls? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to this problem of marine oil pollution, the citizens of Europe, as well as the environment and the maritime sector, expect a Europe that takes strong action. I think that we have succeeded in this. I think that the proposals on the table here are the most attainable. In the longer term, I should also like to see the other proposals my group has presented return in the form of a directive. They are as follows: redefining heavy fuel oil as waste, establishing a European coastguard service, and an obligatory percentage of ship inspections per port and not per Member State: otherwise, in 15 years’ time, we shall have the same problems with the double hull tankers. I have two further remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these relates to shipbuilding. The European shipbuilding sector is doing particularly badly. Tightening up the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package has the potential to breathe new life into the sector. The Commission can present proposals on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I share the concern of my fellow Member Mr Vermeer regarding the worldwide measures. There is the danger of this leading to Europe exporting oil slick disasters. I therefore advocate banging our fist on the table at the International Maritime Organisation to press for single hull tankers to be phased out for good worldwide, ahead of schedule. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no question that we have all pooled our efforts, because we are all aware that it was urgent for us to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We rather have the feeling that the <span class="italic">Erika I </span>and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages have unfortunately come late, and that we must try to prevent being too late for a new <span class="italic">Erika</span>, a new <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or a new disaster. We must do everything we can to prevent this happening again. In this regard, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reply and make it clear that we are prepared to accept all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, though with some modifications to the wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 requires the Council and the Member States to issue the Commission with a mandate to negotiate with the International Maritime Organisation; the honourable Members are aware that, although we do not formally have full powers within the international Maritime Organisation, we are coordinating the latest actions. I would remind you that we have had considerable success recently, multiplying the FIPOL fund by 5. A moment ago Mr Savary told us how clearly insufficient it was in relation to the damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, and it was also insufficient in relation to the damage caused by the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, but in the latter case Totalfina took a responsible attitude and contributed to some of the costs, something which the people responsible for or owners of the cargo are clearly not going to do in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. That is now crystal clear. But, in the end, within the International Maritime Organisation, we have managed to increase the FIPOL funds by 5, to some EUR 950 million (more than a billion dollars at the current exchange rate) compared to 170-180 million dollars previously. That is a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in agreement with Amendment No 3, although there will have to be some modification of the wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 requires the Commission to present a new proposal, in as short a time as possible, in relation to the fuel all ships carry for their own propulsion. This requires an agreement within the International Maritime Organisation, which we are prepared to promote for newly built ships. This amendment therefore also needs some correction of its wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 refers to the shipbuilding industry. Several of the honourable Members have referred to it and are well aware – and my colleague Mr Lamy is here, and it is he who is handling the negotiations – that we have the problem of the clearly unfair behaviour on the part of Korea. We are implementing a series of measures to try to prevent the disappearance of European shipbuilders at a time when Korean shipbuilding and shipbuilding in certain other countries is growing as a result of the substantial state subsidies they receive, leading to entirely unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This support for our shipbuilders must clearly be provided by means of the World Trade Organisation and by means of certain types of specific action, but always guaranteeing compliance with the rules on state aid laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take up some of the issues raised here today. Firstly, Mr Piecyk said that this is not a panacea, a point which has been repeated by Mr Purvis and other speakers. Unfortunately, replacing single hull oil tankers with double hull oil tankers will not guarantee that we do not have another sea disaster, either in Europe or anywhere else in the world. But it is one more measure which will allow us to increase safety. Safety depends on a range of measures, all aspects of which must be applied coherently.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr Savary was absolutely right when he said that the first thing we have to demand is that the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages be applied. As the honourable Members know, the Maritime Safety Agency is operational, with a provisional headquarters, but operational nonetheless, and one of its functions is to guarantee that, in all ports of the European Union, appropriate controls are carried out; that the classification societies carry out their appropriate control obligations. These are elements which must be implemented with all the new requirements and standards we have demanded of both the port authorities and of the classification societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">II</span> packages and the Regulation we are discussing today is simply going to guarantee us a level of safety equivalent to that of the United States. Let us not allow a situation such as the one we have been in for many years, for too many years, which I believe to be inconceivable: that the citizens of the European Union have enjoyed less safety on their coastlines than the citizens of the United States. Following the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> the United States took quick decisions, while in the European Union we have been dragging our feet and not because there had not been other disasters before the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. We had the <span class="italic">Aegean Sea, </span>the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> and many others. So what we are doing here is creating equivalent levels of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is not enough, and Mr Purvis and Mrs Thors were right about this. We must negotiate with Russia, in particular, but also with our Mediterranean neighbours, and persuade them to introduce systems which are equivalent to ours. I have faith in the crusade referred to by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, and I believe that I am not alone, but that I am accompanied by all the honourable Members and many people outside who have the same concerns as me. We must therefore promote the participation of our neighbours, of Russia firstly, but also of all the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting of energy ministers the issues of the double hull, of port controls and of maritime safety were raised and there was support for this issue. And this weekend at the European Union Summit with Russia, Russia has committed itself to supporting the case for double hulls, not only in its own territory, but also, like the Mediterranean countries, in the International Maritime Organisation, because it is of little use if the disaster is caused by a ship in transit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the International Maritime Organisation must take steps in relation to the responsibility of the flag state, preventing flags of convenience, which unfortunately often disguise a complete lack of controls and guarantees. We must make progress on the human factor, which is always key and essential – in shipping, in the maritime sector, as in any other sector – and this means, as Mrs Miguélez said a moment ago, and there are proposals on the table, that the issue of the qualifications and abilities of crews is essential, not only within the Community, but also within the International Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Eventually, legislation will have to be modified at international level, at the level of United Nations maritime law, so that the rights of coastal states and coastal populations are better safeguarded and taken into account in a more balanced fashion. We cannot allow freedom of the seas to become simply uncontrolled freedom to sail genuine ecological time bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are taking a very important step forward, but it is not enough; we must continue to move forward and a key element is the application of what we have already approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
