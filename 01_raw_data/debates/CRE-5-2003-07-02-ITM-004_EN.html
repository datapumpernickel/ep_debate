<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I have tried to be as quick as possible. It is very fortunate that Parliament sometimes gets ahead of the agenda. It obliges us to get away from our usual responses and I am very glad of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for asking me to bring you up to date on such an important event as the fifth ministerial conference of the WTO, which will be held in Cancun in September. Our basic position is well known: we want the Doha development programme to succeed by pursuing the European Union’s three fundamental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first objective concerns support for economic growth, which we need in Europe as much as in the rest of the world. The second concerns the need for multilateral rules to govern more open markets, which will make for a better link between our trade interests and the values of our societies. The third objective is that the developing countries should be integrated into the international trade system, which has been the recurrent theme of this round of negotiations. We see it not as a matter of rhetoric but as something very specific. Each part of the negotiation programme must have added value in terms of development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are only a few weeks away from the Cancun conference; the time we have remaining to make the conference a success is therefore limited and the preparatory process must be stepped up. The necessary political impetus needs to be given in several areas, namely agriculture, access to industrial markets, investment, competition, facilitation of trade and public contracts. In all the areas I have just mentioned, details need to be decided in preparation for the final negotiations. In other matters, like geographical names, the link between trade and development and questions concerning the settlement of disputes, we are looking for initial results at the Cancun conference that will probably be modest and will have to be amplified in the final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still therefore much to be done. Our feeling is that these objectives can be achieved and that the issue is not the complexity of the questions but the political will. This is also true for a subject I have not mentioned but which will be important for the Cancun conference: the problem of the poor countries’ access to medicines. As you know, the United States prevented a decision being reached on this last December despite our having reached a balance around the WTO table. There seem to have been a few developments, but they are not confirmed and it is clear that the US position will have to change if a global agreement is to be reached at Cancun.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into the details, let us consider each of these subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, agriculture. We need a complete set of rules and a date for the submission of bids. From this point of view, the agreement reached in the ‘Agriculture’ Council last week strengthens the hand of your negotiators. That agreement clearly marks the start of a new era. This progress will make for a better use of resources, greater transparency and improved quality, environmental protection and animal welfare, which are all things that farmers, consumers and taxpayers have said they want. This reform also sends a clear signal to the rest of the world: we are very much turning our backs on an old system that created certain distortions of trade. The new agricultural policy is more favourable to trade, as the developing countries wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, after consulting your Parliament, the ministers of agriculture have given your negotiators, Commissioner Fischler and myself, a line of credit which we are not going to make public – we are not so naive – but which we will use to the extent that is necessary and justified. That line of credit will only be opened if we are certain of obtaining something in return. I am thinking, for example, of the disciplines that will have to be put in place for other systems of support, in particular the US system whose harmful effect on trade is known to us. I am also thinking of the protection of geographical names. For all these things we will want something in return, there must be no mistake about that. There is no question of unilateral disarmament, as my colleague Mr Fischler has rightly said. In agriculture, we have done our duty. It is now up to our partners to take initiatives, the US in particular, since in the last few years they have reintroduced a system that creates distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is market access for industrial products. This is a major objective of the Doha programme. The opening of trade must be as universal as possible so that these advantages benefit the largest number. Our aim is to see that the developing countries get better access to our markets, that is, to those of the developed countries, but also to make possible a significant reduction in the trade barriers that might exist between developing countries. We must not lose sight of the importance of the South-South dimension of market access.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the ‘Singapore’ issues, namely competition, investment, facilitation of trade and transparency in public contracts. We must determine the negotiating rules so that talks can be launched formally. This objective remains one of the Union’s priorities. These questions cannot be separated from the single commitment. We will resist all temptation to drop one part or another, for to do so would jeopardise the round’s entire equilibrium. We will therefore have to reach agreement on the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the important questions for the developing countries, namely special and differential treatment and implementation. We are trying to be more flexible towards the developing countries, moving in the direction they desire and wish for without creating a sort of two-speed WTO. We are willing to make progress in this respect and to draw up a framework agreement or even a set of guiding principles for adoption in Cancun in order to ensure that greater attention is paid to these questions which – let me repeat – are important for the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade and the environment, which are sensitive issues in this Assembly, at the Cancun conference we shall have to reach a decision on WTO observer status for multilateral environmental agreements and on the deepening of discussions on other environmental subjects. You know our programme in this field: greater consistency between multilateral environmental agreements and the rules of international trade. That is why, for example, we have asked that the secretariats of the multilateral agreements and the UNEP, which acts as secretariat for some types of multilateral agreements, should be given observer status at the special sessions of the Committee on Trade and Environment devoted to this question that are held in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that the Cancun ministerial conference ought to decide to deepen the discussions on voluntary labelling for environmental purposes. There is a possibility of constructive dialogue in favour of trade in products that are kind to the environment, especially when they originate in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a word about our working methods, by which I mean the relationship between your Parliament and the Commission in this field. As always, we are working closely with Parliament to prepare for the Cancun conference. We have in a way anticipated a number of favourable outcomes of the Convention in this field, since the text currently on the table proposes giving Parliament virtually the same rights as the Council in trade policy, namely codecision for the adoption of laws implementing trade policy, the right to be kept informed throughout the negotiation of international agreements and the right to give assent to the outcome of negotiations, which is the line those of you who have looked into this question were looking for. I therefore believe that our joint efforts have paid off.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no doubt grounds for thinking that, in some respects, the text is still rather convoluted and could be improved. I think there are still a few pockets of unanimity that a number of you have rightly continued to question. Progress has nevertheless been real and European democracy will clearly be the winner if the Intergovernmental Conference does not water down the Convention text on this point. It is therefore with this attitude that we are going to collaborate for the Cancun conference.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, a delegation of Members of the European Parliament will be coming to Cancun with us, as they did to Seattle and Doha. I am personally delighted about that. Likewise, we are in favour of the idea of a WTO parliamentary conference, because the parliamentary contribution can only strengthen the negotiator’s legitimacy. To achieve the outcomes I have just described which, as I said, are both ambitious and feasible, we will have to work hard between now and the Cancun conference. We will do so with you. This dialogue and these debates are necessary because we know that, without them, we will not have your support. That is why we are waiting impatiently for the resolution on which, if I understood correctly, the vote will be taken tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A successful outcome for the Doha Development Round remains a key factor in promoting worldwide economic growth, in order to strengthen multilateralism and Global Governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the general approach with regard to the negotiations as laid down in the Council's mandate for the third ministerial WTO Conference in Seattle. We would like to urge all WTO members to take the necessary enhancing decisions in Cancun in order to bring the Single Undertaking, the topics of that Round, to a successful close within the agreed deadlines. The political will displayed by the Member States during the ministerial OECD meeting at the end of April and the G8 summit in Evian is said to be crucial when it comes to making a success of the conference in Cancun and the trade round. What is important now is that we want to see action rather than words, and that the right negotiating climate should be created.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past three months, we have not seen a great deal of progress in the WTO negotiations. Many target dates for dealing with specific topics have not been met and are thus, unfortunately, on the agenda in Cancun, which is, in consequence, already threatening to become overloaded. Needless to say, we welcome in this framework the agreement that the European Union reached in the Council last week concerning the reforms of its agricultural policy, a result on which we would particularly congratulate Commissioner Fischler. We have good reason for endorsing what the Commissioner has said. We now hope that the United States, in particular, will follow the EU in taking similar steps. We should, however, note the fact that this is a fundamental breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Important items on the agenda in Cancun also include, in our view, the so-called Singapore topics – investments, competition, trade procedures, transparency of public contracts – and we would call on the Commissioner to be very much involved in these topics. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also requests the formal opening of negotiations in the area of competition policy. We would emphasise the potential benefits of binding basic principles in the area of competition policy, such as transparency, non-discrimination, procedural honesty and international cooperation between competing authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of public contracts, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of a multilateral and legally binding agreement on public contracts, including goods and services contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we totally agree that education, public health and the audiovisual sector are sectors that have to be treated separately, and we would like to keep it that way. The European Union has always been one of the advocates of this WTO Round and as the world's largest trade bloc, it owes it to itself to continue to work hard and make Cancun a runaway success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there are, of course, the regular agenda items about opening up the markets, which receives my group's unqualified support. After all, we are aware of trade’s capacity for bringing prosperity to our citizens and our trading partners. On the other hand – as, in fact, the resolution emphasises – these negotiations are, above all, a test of the WTO's capacity to correct a great imbalance in the trade system, to distribute the benefits of trade more evenly and to support sustainable development. They are a test of our capacity for putting globalisation to work in the interest of all people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we put to you the following key questions: will the negotiations lead to a considerably fairer distribution of trade profits, particularly between north and south? Will the negotiations prove that the trade system <span class="italic">serves</span> our citizens’ desire for ecological and social progress rather than <span class="italic">subjecting</span> it to the same? Will the negotiations strengthen the WTO's transparency and liability towards integration into the wider system of Global Governance? The mandate that we would like to give Commissioners Lamy and Fischler in Cancun is to ensure that the answer to these questions is affirmative. My group has set the following four tests in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, EU negotiators must move more in the direction of the developing countries' requirements in the areas of industrial market access, implementation, special and differentiating treatment and, above all, the trade in agricultural products, but must also demand the same commitment from the United States and other developed countries. The United Nations recently asked the industrialised countries to cut back considerably in trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and to phase them out eventually, without a <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> from developing countries. We support this request and would ask the EU negotiators to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and in Cancun, if not sooner – the WTO must at long last deliver on the Doha promise in order to widen the benefits of the TRIPS in public healthcare to countries with a modest, or no, pharmaceutical industry, which the United States has stood alone in blocking since December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Cancun must convey the right message concerning relations between trade and non-trade affairs. In the agricultural modalities, this means safeguarding the right of WTO members to determine food standards and to promote public goods, such as rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare. This also means that clear progress must be made in the trade and environmental agenda of Doha. Cancun must give the current TRIPS review new impetus and must focus more clearly on the interests of developing countries, and it must break through the impasse of the fundamental labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, strengthening the WTO's transparency and democratic liability, where Doha only made a tentative step, must be firmly placed on the negotiating agenda. We want a strong EU initiative in line with the proposals that Parliament adopted by a large majority in October 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">People across the world have two objections to the WTO as it stands now: a lack of honesty and a lack of democracy. We should listen to our citizens; we should make them our priorities. Commissioner, we know that at the moment in West Africa, cotton is a specific example of proposals and negotiations where Europe could make a considerable difference. If you could make a contribution to this in the next few months, this would be a useful leg up. We would like to hear a concrete reaction from you on that score. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, on agriculture. Obviously, like everybody, we in the ELDR Group share the enthusiasm for the outlines of the deal on the reform of the common agricultural policy. We accept entirely that the tactical priority must now be to turn the tables on the Americans in particular, and to see if they will put their money where their mouth is as far as agricultural reform is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has a number of outstanding questions. Firstly, whilst there is visible progress in this reform on the elimination or the reduction of trade-distorting internal support, what about market access? There is nothing in that package that <span class="italic">a priori</span> includes improved market access: beyond a reiteration that the European Union takes in more products than anybody else, I want to know at what point are we going to offer greater market access? Also at what point are we going to really tackle some of the unforgivable aspects of certain sector-specific regimes still in place, notably in sugar?</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of questions concerns the Singapore issues. My group accepts the basic view that the Singapore agenda is one that is worthwhile pursuing, but we are still not quite convinced that the legitimate concerns of developing countries about the scope and complexity of those talks have been addressed. What assurances can the Commissioner give us that those concerns will be addressed by or at the Cancun summit?</p>
<p class="contents">Final set of questions. The Commissioner suggested in his opening remarks that he would act as if he were anticipating the outcome of the next Intergovernmental Conference as far as increased powers for the Europe Parliament are concerned. Could he give me an assurance today that, even if the treaty flowing from the Intergovernmental Conference, which includes the power of assent of the European Parliament, is not yet ratified, in those circumstances he would still submit the outcome of next year's conclusion of this round to us for a vote of assent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These difficulties arise to a large extent from the current world trade system, with its liberalising tendencies and the consequent effects, so often negative, on the fragile economies of the less developed countries. The North and the South have not benefited from this system in equal measure. The most important questions raised by those countries must, therefore, be treated with the utmost respect. It is also essential to put a stop to that liberalising tendency, at least until a full assessment of its consequences is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Development Agenda must not be a paper tiger. It should rather instil in us an unshakeable resolve and steady us on a firm course. Over and above that, it is vital to give real and meaningful content to the clause granting special, privileged treatment to developing countries. The European Union should, moreover, establish a strategic alliance with those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the central issues at stake. I will confine myself to brief comments on three of them: medicines may become a key area, if they are not one already. The United States has stood in the way of an agreement, and is even pressuring some countries to give up the right to import generic medicines. It will be important to stress and emphasise the fact that the right to health must take precedence over all commercial interests. As for the trade in agricultural products, another important area, market access may well be at the heart of the negotiations. The spectacular increase in US farm subsidies does nothing to bring an agreement closer, but the European Union will be able to take an important step forward, particularly if it contributes to the phasing-out, in the long term, of all export subsidies. Finally, as regards access to the industrial market, the textiles and clothing sector merits special attention, since it is particularly vulnerable and since concessions, above all bilateral ones, have already been made. We can countenance a few measures in this sphere aimed exclusively at developing countries, but we must always take care to protect this important industry and its employment potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the dismantling of agricultural subsidies remains very limited shows the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the rich countries for giving up their privileges; the US is the worst offender, despite having joined in the development round. The European Union, obsessed by its own interests, has also revised CAP reform downwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Revising the TRIPS agreement to ban the patenting of living things ought to be a priority at Cancun. If intellectual property rights are applied to all forms of life, they violate the sovereign rights of states and populations to protect their resources and skills and deny the very existence of public good. Negotiators, if you want Cancun to be a success, then listen to the call from the Africa group and drop the Singapore issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of solutions to the famous paragraph 6 of the Doha declaration on access to medicines proves that our governments are under pressure from the pharmaceuticals firms and are afraid to adopt a bold and truly humane stance. Once again, there is a great risk that in the outcome a compromise solution will be vaunted that would have been considered unacceptable at the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">In Egypt last week, the US seemed to take a step forward by dropping a restrictive list of diseases. There then remains the problem of which countries are eligible. What is meant by sufficient manufacturing capacity? Rather than accept a second-rate compromise, should we not rather start again with a new basis for negotiations that will result in an economic and practical solution for the developing countries? Let us not forget the spirit of Doha. Nothing must prevent countries from protecting their population’s health. In particular, nothing must prevent any member from taking part in the WTO talks fairly and transparently. We will be particularly vigilant about this when we are in Cancun.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am asking you not to go back on our commitments. The Doha round must be the round of the developing countries. Nature and human beings are not commodities. The environment and health are more important than the WTO rules. Do not undermine the European Union’s credibility and good faith. Work for sustainable and fair solutions in Cancun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A common fear that we hear voiced is that mechanisms of global governance which are removed from democratic control and participation are being put in place and that a world order is being created which serves the goals of capitalism, and not people. Clearly, against this backdrop, it is vital that we parliamentarians, as the directly elected representatives of the European people, be completely involved in shaping the process and the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The current round which began at Doha is being hailed as the development round. We all share the belief that priorities should be given to the needs of developing nations. These have not shared the benefits of previous trade rounds and the European Union must insist on their full and active participation in the Cancun negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Market access is a very important element in encouraging integration of developing countries into the world economy. The EU has offered ambitious market openings for developing countries in goods as well as in services, while avoiding the risk of going for total liberalisation, which most developing countries could not cope with at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'Everything But Arms' initiative is evidence of the EU's approach in this regard. I urge the Commission to press other developed countries, particularly the United States of America, to follow the European Union's example. It is intolerable for the EU to be criticised by the President of the United States of America for its relationship with the developing world when, in terms of both aid and market access, we are light years ahead. EU imports from developing countries grow at an average rate of 12% and now account for 4% of total EU imports, representing EUR 420 million in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from last week's agreement on reform of the common agricultural policy, it is imperative that we safeguard the European agricultural model in the negotiations. We have a duty to our own consumers and to our farmers to maintain the stability of national agricultural markets and protect them from international price fluctuations and to uphold the models of production and land use which are typical features of European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress that any reductions agreed in the WTO on import tariffs, export refunds or trade-distorting domestic agricultural supports can only be agreed on the basis of a fair distribution of costs among all developed countries, particularly the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in Cancun this September the EU will be participating in a set of talks which are of crucial importance to many sectors of our national economies, from agriculture to culture. In this context it should go without saying that the Commission is obliged to defend strenuously vital interests in these areas, in particular in insisting on full inclusion of the so-called non-trade aspects, such as environmental sustainability, consumer protection, social and regional equilibrium. Failure to do so would result in an agreement that would not be acceptable either to European citizens or indeed to their parliamentary representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compromise agreed in Luxembourg last week largely follows the Commission’s recommendations. Let me ask you a few questions. Can you tell me today what new horizons this reform opens in the negotiations? Can you explain to me what agriculture will gain despite a reform that will have very harmful consequences for our farmers?</p>
<p class="contents">European consumers are making ever-tougher demands about food safety, product quality and production conditions. These are resulting in ever-tighter constraints on farmers regarding environmental protection and animal welfare. Do you think you can meet their expectations by requiring that only products that meet the same standards can enter the European market? If not, that would distort competition on our own markets and penalise our own products. In the matter of public health, the Union has opted for a ban on meat treated with hormones. Will you firmly defend that position, since we do not want it called into question on any pretext?</p>
<p class="contents">Our agriculture also produces very high quality produce that is recognised by designations of origin that are often the spearhead of the regional economy. How do you intend to get our WTO partners to accept them?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we support the Union’s moratorium on GMOs against the complaint filed by the United States. We are looking to you, Commissioner, to maintain an offensive and unyielding stance in defence of European agriculture and consumer demands and to refuse to make any concessions in the matter of opening markets. Yielding everything to liberalism would be the end of European agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Europeans must take care not to weigh the agenda down with issues which are unrelated to the liberalisation of trade, or we will end up handicapping the talks. Commissioner, you said that we have done what was necessary with regard to the CAP. I believe that we have done the absolute minimum needed to stop the definitive failure of the negotiations but we have done nothing more, we have done too little too late. The Community agricultural policy system is still highly, firmly protectionist. Mr Clegg has already spoken about this. Taking the example of sugar, how can we say that the Community agricultural policy is not protectionist where sugar is concerned, for example? What has sugar got to do with rural development? What has sugar got to do with environmental or social clauses? We continue to pursue a hard and fast protectionist approach with regard to sugar, to the detriment of the farming community of Mozambique, for example. The case of sugar – protectionism pure and simple – is only one example. On this basis, Commissioner, Europe will find that it is still in very serious difficulties at Cancun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This must also be the objective at Cancun in September.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect it will be important to ensure that the developing countries receive the technical and financial assistance they need to help them develop their capacity in terms of administration, industry, commerce and exports. At the same time, however, it will also be necessary to emphasise the importance of good administration, good-neighbourliness, internal harmony and the fight against corruption as these countries strive to attain the standards of the developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The alarming prevalence of AIDS, though not just that but many other epidemics too, means that, prior to the Cancun Summit, we should break down the barriers that have been preventing access to reasonably priced medicines everywhere. The problem is a tough one politically and industrio-politically, but it can be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain superpower, in terms of its resources and potential commercial might, Russia, is still outside the WTO. The Cancun agenda does not and cannot include discussion of Russia’s internal legislation or its properly organised administration, or how its WTO membership negotiations could be sped up. It is nevertheless very much in the interests of the EU in particular that Russia should join the WTO as quickly as possible. It is by no means just Russia that is suffering from the situation as it is now: the present state of affairs is essentially weakening reciprocal economic relations between the EU and Russia with regard to investment and trade between them. As with the less developed countries – or should I say as with the other less developed countries? – Russia too should be given support to develop its administration, customs systems, taxation and payments, and other such matters, so that they reach the reliable level that WTO membership requires.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will have a tough job regarding this in the future. Commissioner Lamy is used to hard and productive work, but this particular field of activity will also bring economic benefits for the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are issues which the Socialist Group, like others, finds difficult: the Singapore issues, especially investment and competition. Of course we appreciate the importance of both.</p>
<p class="contents">On investment: currently there are over 2000 bilateral investment treaties. That leads to great complexity for developing countries and an imbalance of power, which will not disappear with a multilateral treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On competition: naturally domination by just a few companies leads to high costs, and developing countries are the prime victims. However, we are still concerned about our approach to the Doha Agenda, and we are not yet convinced that the WTO is the right place or that this is the right time to discuss investment and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commissioner, we have listened very carefully to developing countries. We know that they show very great disquiet about the Singapore issues. The declaration of the trade ministers of the least developed countries of 2 June made this absolutely clear. Some of the larger developing countries are downright opposed to negotiations on these issues. Therefore, there is no way near the explicit consensus which is needed. What should the EU do in those circumstances? Should we persist and foist an agenda on unwilling developing countries? If we do, there will be a price to pay in other negotiations! There are many more important issues and they are identified in our resolution and in the Commission's mandate. Let us concentrate on them at Cancun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With multilateralism under threat, we must do all we can to make Cancun a success. But it is a bit like squaring the circle. On the one hand the Americans are defending their interests by every means, while cultivating the myth of total free trade and, on the other, many countries of the South are unable to take their place in the world economy, questioning the present trade rules and demanding positive discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the EU play its part as a bridge-builder and point the US in the right direction? While noting the positive efforts that have been made, I do wonder about a number of points in the policy on Cancun because we, too, are not without contradictions between our interests and our intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, how can we make a better defence of special and differential treatment? The developing countries are not the only ones at fault; we are not clear on this point either. The scope for such treatment is excessively broad, depriving the concept of differentiation of any real relevance. And the question of the rules is very much a grey area. Can we look at them again for TRIPS and for regional areas, not forgetting the question of technology transfer?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I support those who do not want to drop the aim of preparing questions about ‘Singapore’ – I differ from Mrs McNally slightly here – because it involves key aspects of the link between trade and development. But does the EU have to stick to its initial line? I agree with the bottom up approach, but would it not be better to support the restrictions, especially pre-establishment, involved in the claim for a political area? Moreover, there is an urgent need for the Cancun talks to be underpinned by powerful parallel initiatives for the redistribution of direct investments, guaranteeing their sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, so far as agriculture is concerned, we are defending a strong position regarding internal support and the calculation of tariff reductions. But will the most vulnerable countries of the South, which only produce one thing and are net importers, benefit in any way from it? Should we not increase market access and abolish export subsidies on products that are strategic for those countries and adopt a framework initiative in favour of fair trade? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, too, for matching words with deeds in one or other area where the WTO ought to act differently. If we want to show solidarity with the South and with the most fragile populations of our own area, we cannot treat health, education, water, energy or the necessary progress in sanitation systems as mere commodities. People in all countries must have the benefit of reasonable prices for what are really public services to humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on GATS need to change course. The right to healthy food in sufficient quantity is also a common good of humanity. Farmers of the North and the South must be able to support a perspective of true multifunctionality. Rural development, the very symbol of the non-market sector, and which will be as crucial an issue tomorrow as it is today, is in fact part of the reorientation of the CAP as just adopted by the Council. It reinforces the adjustments that are a positive signal for our small farmers and for those of the countries of the South. But if you can rely on the start of the decoupling affecting cereals products or meat, then export subsidies must be less obvious and must continue to be less obvious. The distinctive nature of European farmers must be protected. But if solidarity with the small farmers of the South is to be clear, they must be allowed to benefit from support systems similar to the CAP, which still protects European farmers. The prime task of both of them is to feed their fellow citizens by freely producing the appropriate food. They must be helped to do so in the face of the two or three agro-industrial monopolies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Doha Development Round was not worthy of its name. Now, the Doha deadlines are to be maintained. Mrs McNally is quite right in saying that this is not the time for adding new topics to the agenda that take account neither of the developing countries nor of the environment. This would derail the debate on those topics concerned with promoting the objective of sustainable development. This is an objective that, together with free and fair trade and the eradication of poverty, is incorporated into the EU’s new draft Constitution. The EU now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate that the Constitution is not just a paper tiger. What the EU should focus upon is ensuring that every country has its say in the negotiations and not only, as is usually the case, the rich and privileged countries that will take care of their own interests. Cancun must result in practical progress for the developing countries and show that there is a real willingness on the part of the rich countries to prioritise the fight against poverty. Finally, it must at long last be ensured that governments do not have a monopoly on negotiating and implementing WTO agreements, but that a democratically elected assembly is set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If Europe receives the measure with which it has already given, it ought therefore to get a lot in Cancun. Was not the avowed aim of the CAP reform to improve the Union’s negotiating position in the Doha round and not to define the agricultural policy the Europeans need?</p>
<p class="contents">My question is therefore this. What substantial concessions is the Union asking from its partners in return for the cascade of unilateral concessions it has made since the end of the Uruguay round? I will mention a few: the ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative, the unilateral abolition of import duties on cereals from the Black Sea, the granting of tariff quotas, the decoupling of compensatory aid and the associated dismantling of our common organisation of agricultural markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Union is at least going to put the unfortunate Blair House Agreement back on the negotiating table, since it prevents us from pursuing a consistent policy for oilseed development and is causing our output to stagnate at a derisory million tonnes while world production is increasing by 5% a year and now exceeds 300 million tonnes. I also hope that the Commission will get the principle accepted that nations have a right to feed themselves, since this is a basic principle of food security in both quality and quantity terms. We must not in fact allow countries that are structural exporters to force us to give them a so-called right of access to the Community market for products in which the European Union has a production surplus or for products, Mr President, that we want strictly controlled, like GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, they have to have better access to our market for their industrial manufactured goods and agricultural produce. In addition, though, they need to improve the knowledge they need in order to be able to get a foothold in the various markets, and their ability to actively and expertly defend their interests in WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore strongly support the Commission in its efforts, by means of technical aid, to make it easier for these countries to become independent actors on the world market. If, though, we are not to lose sight of the fact that economic growth for all trading partners is the most important goal of WTO negotiations, it naturally follows that, in offering access to this market, we must, in the negotiations, develop an adequate strategy with regard to the developing countries so that they might have a practical awareness of the advantages of negotiating on the traditional issues of market access and competition, as well as on other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we have an interest, in the context of the GATS negotiations, in cautiously extending the scope of services, we insist on the cultural and organisational diversity of Europe, as reflected in the area of health, education, the audio-visual sector, and the local provision of services of general interest. We also believe that we should have no interest in making exceptions of this sort for further sectors and removing them from the scope of the market organisation for services. Europe leads the world by a long way in the provision of services. Those who, in this area, adopt a defensive and protectionist position do not recognise the strengths and competitive advantages that the European Union possesses.</p>
<p class="contents">What has to be said as regards the body of WTO legislation is that we are meant, in particular, to develop the rules on procedure, transparency and the resolution of disputes, and that the WTO should become an independent and international jurisdiction in trade matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The object of the enterprise is that members of the parliaments of countries belonging to the WTO should meet together in order to exchange information. An additional consideration is that, in our view, many trade issues are moving further and further away from what have traditionally been considered as such, with which they formerly coincided, and touch on very sensitive areas that are of great interest to many members of the public. These include the service sector among many others. The event will be held in Cancun on 9 and 12 September, and this House will be playing a leading part in it, with many of our Members being present. We would of course be glad if all Members of this House with an interest in these matters were to circulate information about this event.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also address a second point, one raised by Mr Clegg, that being the issue of whether you will at all agree – whether or not the Convention so decides – that this House must approve the agreement negotiated in Cancun, no matter when or how it is concluded?</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my third point. Might you consider reiterating today that Parliament is to give its approval and have – within the Article 133 Committee – a right equal to that of the Council to be involved and informed, and, furthermore, are you able to make a statement to the effect that Parliament should also have a part to play in allocating seats on it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what I think is expected by those, such as the trade ministers of the LDCs very recently, who are criticising the WTO’s inability to respect the Doha timetable, to complete the negotiations on decisions in favour of development, on access to medicines, special and differential treatment or trade in agricultural products. So far, no progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate my fear of this ‘dimension’ of development disappearing due to a policy that gives priority only to commercial trade and has been dogmatic in choosing to liberalise it. While the gulf between rich and poor countries is widening, it is difficult to accept this desire to include new subjects such as investment, competition or public markets.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, GATS threatens public services and State missions when there has not yet been any evaluation of what effect liberalisation may have. Under these circumstances, there should be a moratorium. The right to health, education, food safety, and energy should prevail above commercial interests. The European Union should, on the contrary, work towards the democratisation of the international trade system and cooperate closely with developing countries so that the development objectives prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, we have the task of enabling poor countries to meet the standards on working conditions, animal welfare and the environment, so that they can import their products into Europe. For this, producers in developing countries will need help in the field of producing, and trading in, products in line with European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would argue in favour of a restricted agenda that contains the essential topics I have mentioned.

It may be commercially rather more appealing for Europe to negotiate on new topics, but developing countries simply do not have the capacity to do this.</p>

<p class="contents">All of these issues are essential to ensuring that multilateral trade relations lead to economic growth, if we want this growth to be equitable and its benefits also to reach the least-developed countries. Hence the need to make progress on all fronts in the development agenda and if possible within the time periods laid down, in line with the support you are providing on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the brevity with which I am obliged to speak, I will restrict myself to access to the industrial product markets, in particular, naturally, the textiles and clothing sectors and to respect for the rules which govern international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that there is no reduction in the European Union's tariffs while other countries have not reached the tariff levels laid down in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that you pay special attention, within the framework of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, to the issue of designs and the international exhaustion of the registered trademark and to actions to combat counterfeiting and pirating.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask you to promote simplification of the commercial defence mechanisms in order to make them quicker and more effective, because the persistence of tariff barriers, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers is incompatible with the process of liberalising the markets.

<p class="contents">In this sense, in terms of agriculture, we of course need to agree to increase the special and differential treatment for LDCs that are already included in the Marrakesh Treaty. We also need to confirm the results of Doha with regard to the substantial reduction of our export refunds, and at the same time, to ensure that this measure is extended to all forms of export subsidies because we are aware that it is not only the Union that is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is clear that the Union should condemn the recent American farm bill, which protects American producers against the ups and downs of the market, and which therefore threatens to generate an excess in supply and a fall in prices on international markets. As well as this, Commissioner, the Union must defend the right of each Member State of the WTO to set its production and food safety standards and to apply them to the products that come on to their markets. European producers have a right to this guarantee on imports, as well as international recognition of geographical indications in order to increase the value of their regions and traditional know-how.</p>

There is the feeling that the European Union is going to make it even more complicated with its negotiation strategy. That Cancun is not looking good is due to the frustrations that have built up among developing countries since the end of the Uruguay round, frustrations which have already led to the failure of the Seattle Conference. Once again, their confidence is being tested, as many of the significant commitments made in Doha were not honoured and the deadlines not respected. This is true of such issues as access to medication, but also of special and differential treatment, the issues surrounding implementation, and of reform of the regulations on dispute settlement. This is about what Europe is going to achieve during these negotiations by using its considerable clout. Is it going to use it in order to provide answers that restore developing countries’ confidence, or will it go no further than a narrow vision of its commercial interests?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the Singapore subjects. Why is there this insistence on imposing a multilateral agreement on investments on the developing countries at all costs, when they do not want it? They cannot see why the rules and conditions for foreign investment in their countries should be governed by the WTO. However, you insist on making it one of the European Union’s conditions for an agreement in Cancun. Do you not feel that this is an extra burden that serves no purpose? You are entering into a wrestling match between the European Union and the developing countries. Rather than that, we would prefer an alliance between the European Union and the countries of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">You have also heard many different speakers from different groups in this House asking you to concentrate on the essentials. Use your clout, the European Union’s considerable influence, to improve special and differentiated treatment, to make progress towards access to the markets, to bring about reform of dispute settlement, to ensure that the environment is taken into account, to promote access to medication, and not to serve an agreement on investments, public markets or competition, which should not be the responsibility of the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The global economy needs framework conditions, and if we do not succeed in giving it some, and in good time, we will face conflict situations that may well lead to major difficulties, not only for us in Europe, but also for the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As 20% of our jobs depend on world trade, our vital interests are involved when we consider what markets will be accessible to us in future. There are currently ten new countries wanting to join us, and, when they do, Europe’s population will grow by 20%, offering us an interesting market, with interesting production techniques. Across the world, billions of consumers await the products and services that we supply.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be constantly reminding ourselves that Europe’s success is in fact founded on the active efforts of small and medium-sized firms, which account for 80% of taxes paid. For that reason, it should be a matter of primary concern for us that the right conditions should be created to enable small and medium-sized firms to take part in international trade. We therefore demand that all import rules be notified to, and made available by, the WTO, so that it becomes once and for all transparently clear what provisions – on labelling, packaging customs duties – have to be complied with when supplying goods to a specific country.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, if a firm is part of a group and has its own experts, it can readily find the answers to a vast number of questions, but for a small firm of under half a dozen people, this is impossible. We therefore demand that there should be a register, kept at the WTO, in which the import rules of every country are recorded, with the possibility of completing a standard form, in current language, downloaded from the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we want to give small and medium-sized firms in developing countries a chance to export, we also demand that the 18 million small and medium-sized firms that we have at present in the European Union – especially those interested in exporting worldwide – should get what they are entitled to, and that the WTO should give them a fair chance. The fact is that these firms employ two-thirds of the European Union’s workforce, and I believe that it is worth our while to stand up for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first point is that the Doha Declaration is very clear on the need to ensure the best possible balance between commercial and non-commercial aspects of trade. In this connection, key issues include the precautionary principle, food safety, basic rules governing GMOs and also respect for designations of origin and geographical descriptions. We will have to make it clear that the use by various third countries of our geographical descriptions and designations of origin, which are linked to a culture, a region and a history, as generic and semi-generic products is completely unacceptable. For Australian, Canadian and New Zealand producers to sell products labelled as ‘port’, ‘Madeira’, ‘champagne’, ‘Parma ham’, ‘Manchego cheese’, and so on, is unacceptable because it demonstrates an improper appropriation of a commercial advantage to which those producers are not entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is to remind you that the recent reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) fully permits us to assume a more assertive stance in the negotiations. Rather than pour all our energy into the issue of protecting geographical descriptions and non-commercial concerns, we can also attempt to impose a wide range of regulations, in particular toughening legislation on export credits, state-owned enterprises and the abuse of food aid and the <span class="italic">de minimis </span>clause. We can convince all rich countries to grant the 49 poorest countries in the world the same conditions granted by the EU through the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative. We can force a clear distinction to be drawn between developing countries and the poorest countries in the world, since it is unrealistic to put countries such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and various South American States in the same class as Mozambique, Chad, Burkina Faso and most of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States. Apart from agriculture, this is also an issue in, for example, the textile and clothing sector, where the complete opening up of the Community market to products from the former group of countries would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the European Union, especially in the poorest countries and those lagging furthest behind, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and the new Member States in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped, then, that a fundamental balance between all these concerns can be reached at Cancun. If it is not, globalisation will be rejected by our societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not one single product is still receiving direct support now and, insofar as import tariffs still apply in the European Union, production is restricted and an important proportion of the world market has been surrendered. Accordingly, the assigning of quotas in the EU's dairy sector has meant that we have relinquished five percent of our share in world trade. Unfortunately, I have to say that this five percent has not been utilised in any way by developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union has concluded a trade agreement with the world's 48 poorest countries, and we provide free market access to many former colonies and to the Balkan countries. If we consider that we are on the eve of an enormous enlargement of the Union, we have to establish that the European Union has given free trade a huge shot in the arm. We already import more agricultural products from the developing world than the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand put together. This means that the European Union has adopted an open stance and has, in this respect, most definitely contributed to a new world trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, therefore, not surprise me if certain groupings, including in this Parliament, were to claim that this agreement does not go far enough. We have gone further than any other trading bloc; we offer more market access than any other trading bloc. This means that it is precisely this strong position that will weaken us if we do not take a united stand. By undermining the joint European position, there will be even less consideration in the world for non-trade affairs, such as animal welfare, food safety, the environment, but also for social aspects. This is precisely the quality that Europe can add to a new world trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to congratulate the European Commission, particularly Commissioner Lamy and his colleague, Mr Fischler. I hope that this Parliament will be united behind the Commission. Indeed, on the basis of the present agreements on agricultural policy reform, we are in a strong position in new negotiations, and we have a great deal to offer to the world in terms of social justice, but also in relation to non-trade matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, as the speeches have shown, multilateral trade negotiations in the twenty-first century have many facets and are a mixture of interests and values, one that is, in any case for us Europeans, to some extent indissoluble. They also raise, as we have realised from listening to you, issues around the overall balances on the international stage, between North and South, North and North and South and South. I would briefly like to respond to a few of your speeches, grouping them into three themes, first of all access to the market, then the rules of international trade, and finally, several other issues that are not necessarily directly linked to the first two but are worthy of clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on access to the market, concerning the industrial sector, I agree with what has been said. We must move towards what some of the developing countries want. It is in their interest and also in our interest. However, let us remember that there is also a South-South interest in the liberalisation of trade for manufactured products. Trade in manufactured products still represents 80% of world trade. Here we have all the dimensions that I mentioned, and Mrs Ferrer is right in saying that in these matters, we should not stop at tariff issues, but also look at non-tariff barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">You have all spoken a great deal about agriculture, which is quite normal due to the current circumstances. It is true that the reform of the common agricultural policy that was adopted last week gives more impressive results in terms of discipline – the issue of budgetary support for our farmers – than in terms of promises of broader access to the markets in the future. However, we have not yet agreed to confirm in some way at WTO level, the disciplines that we decided between us. We are free to confirm them or not at international level and we will do so if others do. We are therefore looking for something in return, which is what we are going to work on for now, as the support compensates for some handicaps and takes into account some concerns among European consumers and citizens. As Mrs Auroi and Mr Bernier said, with our support we are compensating for this type of handicap or additional constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Clegg asked whether there was still room for manoeuvre in the negotiations in terms of access to the market. I am sure he will allow me, and Mr Fischler, to remain discreet as regards how much we have in our pocket. Mr Clegg will be aware that it is not good to negotiate with transparent pockets, so our pockets will not be transparent in a public sitting such as today’s. However, he is right, as is Mr Della Vedova. There is no doubt that the forthcoming reform of the sugar market, which Mr Fischler and the Commission have announced for the autumn, is probably more promising from this point of view for a product that holds great interest for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, in response to Mr Souchet, that this reform of the common agricultural policy was made with European considerations in mind, by Europeans and for Europeans. It is all the better if it improves our position in international negotiations, but that was not our original motivation. Our motivation, as established at the Berlin European Council, was to carry out a mid-term review of some organisations of the market and of the functioning of our support for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the rules, some of you have mentioned access to medication. I will not repeat what I said in my initial speech. The European Union’s position on this is clear: we support the commitment made in December and we expect the Americans to adhere to it, otherwise there will be a major problem in Cancun.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding non-commercial concerns, to which Mr van den Berg made particular reference, they are indeed on the table, including for agriculture: animal welfare, the environment and food safety. There are also subjects concerned with the regulation of international trade, such as the geographical indications cited by Mr Garot and Mr Cunha. You are right. We cannot tell our farmers that the time has come to think less about quantity and more about quality without keeping to the agenda that we have, which consists of improving and making more operational and more easy what the WTO texts are already establishing in terms of protection: geographical indications.</p>
<p class="contents">The last delicate subject is the so-called Singapore subjects, and in particular investment. Our starting point has always been that it is better to have a good multilateral international platform than a bad jungle of bilateral agreements. You rightly said that some developing countries are not enthusiastic, but not all of them! Some others are entirely in favour of starting negotiations on these subjects, particularly investment. Fundamentally, what developing countries are saying is a little like what I have heard here this afternoon: some are very much in favour, and some are very much against, some are ‘maybe’ for, and others are against ‘unless’. That is the situation we are in and in answer to Mr Désir, in the choice between the bilateral jungle and multilateral order, I have often heard him say things that are more multilateralist than what he has said this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">What path should we take? We must stay firm on the need to deal with these issues, while responding to the justified and repeated concerns of a number of developing countries, to the fear that they have that by committing to multilateral agreements on these subjects, they would be reducing the area of autonomy of their economic policies. We must find ways of responding to this concern. In any case, in general, I am still persuaded that multilateral is better than bilateral in these fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding special and differential treatment and issues of implementation, I think that I indicated in my initial speech that the European Union was open and that it was more a case of convincing other partners in the North, the United States, Japan, Canada, to demonstrate a little more flexibility. We are working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will deal with two or three more questions. Regarding cotton, Mr Van den Berg, it is not the Union, for once, that is being accused by the developing countries. We do not export any cotton. We import a huge amount of cotton and what we do produce in no way supports exportation. We must produce 2% to 3% of the cotton produced in the world. It is therefore the United States that is being challenged on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McNally and Mr van den Berg talked about fundamental working standards. Unfortunately, this subject is not on the programme for Cancun, because it was not put on the programme for the cycle of negotiations launched in Doha. Some, but not all of the subjects launched in Doha are on the programme for Cancun. Having said that, we cannot add new subjects to the Doha programme. You know our position: we regret not having managed to better link fundamental work standards and the rules of the World Trade Organization. To some extent, we made do with our bilateral policies in order to achieve this. Therefore we cannot, unfortunately, expect good news from Cancun on this point. We need to wait for another cycle of negotiations to put the subject back on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of what the Commission thinks of Parliament being involved at the end of the negotiations, I have no objection at all, on behalf of the Commission, to the results of the cycle ending with a vote in the European Parliament, unless of course the Council of Ministers disagrees. In any case, the Commission’s position is what I have just told you, in response to Mrs Mann and Mr Clegg.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Russia’s accession to the WTO, I can tell Mr Suominen that we are working on it. I am spending my day here today, with my colleague German Gref, who is the Russian Minister for the Economy and Finance and the negotiator appointed by Mr Putin. This is probably our sixth negotiating session and, thanks to the debate this afternoon, you have given him the opportunity to look around this lovely town of Strasbourg, and I am sure that he will be very grateful to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Mrs Auroi and Mrs Boudjenah that we debated GATS only a few weeks ago. Parliament took a position on it, so I am not going to come back to the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the good news that Mrs Mann gave us on the joint demonstration in Cancun by the European Parliament and the International Parliamentary Union, and the work that she, Mr Schwaiger, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and many others have done to associate the national parliaments more with the work of the WTO, for the Commission this is good news. You know that we support your efforts in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
