The words of the English text, which I understand to be the basic text, are: "asked the Council presidency". In the Danish text, the words "Council presidency" have been translated by the word "Rådet", and there is no mention of the presidency. This is a serious political and translation error. But, in addition, there is another error, namely that the following words have been included in the English text: "with all the parties in the EU concerned", and those words are quite simply not included in the Danish text. I would urge that a correct Danish translation of the text be obtained, for I find it a very serious matter that, in point 8 concerning Austria, these two mistakes have been made which, from a political point of view, completely alter the sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reference is made to a ‘European interparliamentary body on security and defence’. The word ‘organe’ has been correctly used in the French version. Initially I had proposed the term ‘forum’, but discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy produced a compromise and we agreed o use an equivalent of the French ‘organe’ instead. In the English version the word should be ‘body’, and, probably, ‘Gremium’ in the German. My knowledge of the other languages is insufficient.

It has to be recognised that late payment is the chief cause of the cases of insolvency threatening the survival of many firms, making them bankrupt, which translates into job losses. </p>
<p class="contents">The national regulations aimed at managing this problem differ considerably from one Member State to another. Hence the interest in adopting legislation aimed at harmonising the provisions relating to late payment, due dates and the legal rate of interest at European level as soon as possible. A legal framework needs to be established to discourage late payment and give creditors the right to fair compensation in case of late payment. That is the purpose of the directive we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on this text were difficult. A common position was finally adopted on 29 May last. The European Parliament emerged from those long negotiations victorious on several crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences of opinion between Parliament and Council focussed around the difference in treatment between the public and private sectors, which have finally been placed on an equal footing. As regards retention of title, Parliament fought to have this provision included in the text of the directive. Thus, the Member States must ensure that the seller retains title in the goods until full settlement, while complying with the applicable national provisions. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the anti-abuse clause, the European Parliament refused to give precedence to freedom of contract to the detriment of the creditor. The directive therefore provides that, when an agreement mainly serves the purpose of procuring the debtor additional liquidity at the expense of the creditor or where the main contractor imposes on his suppliers and sub-contractors terms of payment which are not justified on the grounds of the terms granted to himself, such provisions may be considered to be factors constituting abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">As to compensation, apart from the cases where the debtor is not responsible for the delay, the creditor is entitled as a result of this agreement to claim reasonable compensation from the debtor for all recovery costs incurred. This compensation may include the creditor’s borrowing costs or bank overdraft, administrative recovery costs paid for by the creditor company, recovery costs of debt recovery organisations and recovery costs arising from legal action.</p>
<p class="contents">On interest, Parliament and the Council reached agreement on a rate of 7% above Central European Bank rate, making a total of 10.5% at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament wanted to reduce the period after which interest is due for late payment to 21 days from the date of receipt of the invoice rather than 30 days as envisaged by the Council. In the end the period of 30 days was maintained, but with the proviso that it may give rise to action for compensation if it constitutes a manifest abuse against the creditor.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the result of the conciliation was satisfying as a number of the European Parliament’s wishes are incorporated. I have therefore voted in favour of this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This demonstrates yet again Labour's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Late payment often suffocates many credible businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies. Consequently, many are tragically forced into receivership, through no fault of their own.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure, however, will help allow small businesses to fight back. Creditors will be entitled to charge a statutory interest rate of 7% on their debts, encouraging debtors to pay early. Furthermore, if debts are not repaid, creditors will also be able to claim compensation form debtors for recovery costs.</p>
<p class="contents">By introducing greater certainty in business transactions across Europe, small companies will gain confidence in trading, not just across Britain, but right across the European Single Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership of the Single Market the largest trading bloc in the world, is crucial for jobs in the North West. Nearly 40% of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States. As a part of the EU Single Market, they have access to over 370m potential customers – over 6 times more than in Britain alone. In a few years' time, following the enlargement of the European Union, they will have access to a potential 500m customers – as big as the American and Japanese markets put together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government is determined to make the Single Market work for British business. By giving UK businesses the confidence to reach into these markets, this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade, growth and employment across both the North West and all of Britain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can make no other assessment than that, for Sweden, this was a fixed-term derogation which would one day come to an end in favour of current Community directives. Through its actions, the Swedish Government has helped obscure this fact in the course of the debate of recent years. This has also meant that, in spite of knowing the implications of the derogation, it has avoided taking those measures required for the purpose of adjusting both its domestic market and those tools which Sweden has used as part of its alcohol policy. Following its informal promise to the Commission to approve the proposal, the Swedish Government must now appreciate the need to adjust its alcohol policy and find other methods of controlling alcohol consumption in the country and of limiting alcohol-related harm. It is time the Government realised this. </p>

<p class="contents">Now that the Commission is rejecting Sweden’s argument and placing the emphasis upon the operation of the internal market, we fear that alcohol policy will sustain great damage in Sweden.

<p class="contents">That split conceals another: the first group includes the supporters of a great federalist leap forward and realists who are beginning to wonder if a totally integrated Europe – economically and politically – really amounts to the correct solution faced with enlargement and the democratic deficit. It gives me some satisfaction to say that the second category looks like winning, which suits us fine. The only point that needs to be added is acceptable to us, as it is about increasing the possibility of so-called ‘enhanced cooperation’. We prefer to call it ‘differentiated cooperation’, to make it clear that this does not mean driving Europe up a one way street to federalism but instead leaving Member States free to explore, applying variable geometry, the cooperation they consider most in line with their vision of the future and their interests. </p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, whatever the term used – ‘enhanced’ or ‘differentiated’ cooperation, the main thing in our view is to take the first step and open discussions, breaking the now totally deadlock of the European system. I would add that we think the new differentiated cooperation should be applicable to security policy so that it can be developed on a voluntary basis and in respect for national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if the Feira Council is going to deal with the Charter of Fundamental Rights we want it kept off the IGC agenda so that it can take the form of a statement not incorporated into the Treaty. As I have already had occasion to say in this House and in the forum responsible for drawing up the Charter, it would certainly be useful to proclaim our common values – if it is done well – but we must not deprive our peoples of the freedom to define the rights of their own citizens themselves.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals in this explanation of vote to justify our vote in favour, stressing that, in spite of everything, this resolution contains important points, including the need for dialogue, the need to get past the stage of pseudo-sanctions against Austria – which has not been constructive – and make sure the Minutes state that the vote also includes an important request we formulated last April and which we now reiterate: review of the seat of the institutions. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has spoken very clearly. Yesterday we gave a practical demonstration of our position by abolishing the Friday sittings. I think it is high time account was taken in the Treaty reforms of our determination to insist finally on a status that makes us masters of our own procedure, and masters of our own decisions as to the seat and meeting place of our institution.

<p class="contents">As everyone knows, Greek workers and the entire Greek population have already paid a very high price for Greece’s full accession to EMU and, following the Feira decisions, they will continue to pay the cost of “sustainability”, i.e. staying in EMU, while large corporations and monopolies continue to step up their level of exploitation and increase their profits. </p>
<p class="contents">The Feira Council is being called upon to promote the interests of big business even more resolutely and to promote the speedy militarization of the European Union by creating a European army whose main mission will be to intervene militarily in third countries and lend support to capitalist forces within the Member States of the EU itself, at the expense of the grass roots movement. This summit will strengthen measures to safeguard the “internal security” of capitalism by steering and crushing the grassroots movement when the EU Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">The new revision of the Treaties being promoted at the Intergovernmental Conference will be the main item on the agenda at the Feira Summit. The aim is to legislate for the basic interests of monopolies, thereby making conditions even worse for workers, for the weaker sections of society and for the less “powerful” countries. Abolishing the veto, extending qualified majority voting in decision making and, more importantly, instituting “enhanced cooperation” and “flexibility” will all serve precisely these monopolistic interests under the guise of “efficiency”, thus giving powerful countries a fast track for exploiting both countries and people. </p>
<p class="contents">Further dismantling of the social rights of workers, starting with the right to social security, is on the agenda of the Feira Summit. The report by the “group of wise men” and the decisions which will be taken will aim, on the pretext of combating unemployment, to sacrifice the rights paid for by workers with blood, sweat and tears on the alter of increased profits for the monopolies and “competition”, budgetary discipline and support for the euro. </p>

Clearly, at this point four days before the European Council, it is now the responsibility of this summit, as a whole and as the highest body of the Union, to take advantage of this historic opportunity to update the EU’s policy on Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving this task to the Portuguese Presidency is an attempt to place all the responsibility for what may happen on the shoulders of one country which cannot, at the wrong time and on its own, solve a problem which concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not to mention the reasons for this approval which are difficult to understand given the basic policy. After all, what has changed in Austria? Has the government fallen? Fortunately this small part of the text does not invalidate the rest of its content which I regard as positive. Unfortunately it was clearly much more to serve the petty interests of the Portuguese component of the PPE that this group adopted this position than due to the belief in and usefulness of this particular vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have voted against this resolution to affirm our opposition not only to a common European army but to national armies as well. The past half-century shows that the armies of the great imperialist powers of Europe, in alliance or each on its own hunting ground, were not there to defend the people, but to carry on wars of pillage. For example, the French army was used for the colonial wars: Madagascar, Indo-China, Algeria. Since these colonies became independent, it has intervened to support infamous dictatorships, especially in its former African colonies. The other former colonial powers of Europe have done the same in the same situation. </p>
<p class="contents">The recent intervention by European armies against Serbia and Kosovo is certainly nothing to be proud of. The author of the report is careful not to specify which enemy the future European army is intended to fight. So what is it for and who is it against, if not to allow the great powers of Europe to be able to continue, on behalf of the European Union as a whole, their Community political game in Africa, the West Indies or elsewhere?</p>

Nevertheless, the crisis in the Balkans has demonstrated the shortcomings of the European Union.

We need to learn from our experience with the war in the Balkans, so that a disaster of this kind cannot be repeated.</p>

The exercise is complicated, first because it is necessary to try to clarify relations with NATO, and because the United States not to mention other countries in NATO which are not members of the European Union, like Turkey, are not making our task any easier. Everything is also made more difficult by the determination of the Union institutions to extend the scope of this new policy, by presenting it as ‘a further step towards European political integration’, in the words of the resolution we have just voted on. In other words, it is another step towards supra-nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the scope of this security policy, there is deliberate ambiguity. It would not, strictly speaking, be a matter of so-called Petersberg-style tasks (crisis prevention and peacekeeping in third countries, excluding defence of national territory or vital external interests), but the European Parliament constantly insists on raising a much larger objective, a common security and defence policy in the broad sense. In fact, that is the title of the resolution voted on today. Ambiguity is increased by the decision to implement common military resources intended to prevent crises (for example, the European rapid reaction force, of 50 000 to 60 000 men, agreed at Helsinki), which means the ‘integrationists’ can constantly play with words and put it about that there is some question of implementing a defence policy in the full sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of both method and objective – political integration or cooperation – we think it is counterproductive to be constantly brandishing the prospect of a unitary and integrated supranational power. To act effectively we need to establish voluntary cooperation, with variable geometry, where Member States of the Union with an interest in this or that action would participate – and there is no reason why non-member states should not participate too, where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group believes in advancing towards common security actions, provided we do not get boxed into a rigid institutional system, but instead establish flexible procedures based on voluntary input and respect for national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are open to the idea of common security actions, which we believe Europe badly needs. But at the same time we must remain very clear about the conditions for them. It is impossible to hand over power of military decision (even if we are initially told that only Petersberg tasks will be involved) to very imperfectly democratic European institutions – and so they will remain, to human eyes, because there is no such thing as a European people. </p>
<p class="contents">There are three consequences of that: the national democracies must always have the last word, so the operations concerned must remain in an inter-state context; decisions can in no case be taken by majority on issues of principle; the system must be based on the possibility of ‘differentiated actions’ permitting each people to exercise its freedom of choice without discontinuity.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Feira Council will decide to add this issue to the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, nonetheless, a couple of areas where the Danish Social Democrats believe that care ought to be exercised. Careful consideration ought to be given to the way in which the European Parliament is to be involved in the area of defence and security policy. We are uneasy about the European Parliament’s influence in this area, for we believe that defence and security policy is predominantly an intergovernmental matter. The proposal paves the way for the increased use of majority decision-making, over and above what is laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam in connection with a common defence and security policy. We see no reason for extending majority decision-making into this area. With regard to necessary future investments in new technology and new equipment for the military, we think that these should be made possible through changes to the order of priorities in the national defence budgets. There is no need to increase the overall European defence budgets. We would also refer to the Danish reservation concerning common action in the defence sphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We voted against the present resolution by way of expressing our dissatisfaction regarding the conduct of the European Parliament delegation during the UN General Assembly. </p>
<p class="contents">We received the news that Mrs Theorin, chairperson of our delegation at that assembly, campaigned formally and informally on behalf of the EP for the introduction of the right of women to free abortion in all UN countries. On behalf of the EP no less, she is exerting pressure on other countries, including Poland, to concur with the EU opinion. As MEPs, we disassociate ourselves from this opinion and consequently do not wish to take any responsibility in this respect. We are of the firm opinion that unborn life, as a gift from our Creator, is worth protecting. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Union has no authority at all under its treaties to force candidate countries to adopt specific legislation in this area of policy. We would therefore make it absolutely clear that the right to free abortion cannot be presented to the candidate countries as a criterion for entry into the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As co-signatory to that resolution, Mrs Lulling made the following statement in Strasbourg:</p>
<p class="contents">‘I have just had the opportunity of attending the special General Assembly of the United Nations called from 5 to 9 June 2000 in New York to evaluate progress since the last UN world conference on women, which took place in 1995 in Beijing, on the implementation of the Beijing Action Platform. The Assembly was attended by some ten thousand women, making it the ideal meeting place for analysing the achievements of the last five years and comparing attitudes – which are very different moreover – on the need to accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform. Although we are not euphoric, the results of the Assembly are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of certain reactions in this Parliament, both today and yesterday during the debate, from some colleagues who were not in New York – reactions obviously based on misinformation and misunderstanding – I want to make it clear that the Members of the European Parliament present in New York did not speak on behalf of this Parliament without a mandate. Actually, they were not entitled to speak, given the procedure at special General Assemblies of the UN. It is the Presidency of the European Union that speaks on behalf of the Union at that kind of international conference. So there are no grounds for putting words into the mouths of the Members of the European Parliament present in New York on mere intent.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly we were active behind the scenes, if I can call it that, and we had informal but useful meetings with Members of Parliament from the Member States and the candidate countries for membership of the European Union attending as part of their national delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own part, I contributed with my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, to dispelling an impression which prevailed notably among certain third country delegations, that, for the women of the European Union, in terms of gender equality, sexual orientation and abortion were the absolute priorities in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Because people were putting words into the mouths of various parties, particularly Poland’s, I would like to specify that as regards gender equality, Poland is adopting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and is not calling into question the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on discrimination based on gender. But the Treaty of Amsterdam does not oblige Poland to legislate on abortion. It can be recommended to do so, but subsidiarity applies. I wanted to make that clear to dispel any misunderstanding about what really happened in New York. It is true that the militants of a certain sexual orientation – which is fortunately only a problem for a tiny minority of women in Europe and the world, and which is not mine – are much more visible, even in New York, than the millions of women who, because of their economic and social situation, have other preoccupations and priorities when it comes to gender equality.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After very acrimonious negotiations, realism in appreciating the needs of women and respect for their dignity carried the day. But there was strong political pressure from the United States, Japan and the European Union, and strong ideological pressure from feminist NGOs generously financed by the Western countries.</p>
<p class="contents">How, for instance, can the pressure exercised by the European Union on Nicaragua and Poland be justified? How can so-called ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ be weighed against development aid or deadlines for joining the European Union? The pressure on the poorest countries was so great that dozens of members of the American Congress and national or European Members of Parliament officially dissociated themselves from their delegations, expressly condemning their positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same lines, it is a real education to note that, although they are all officially specialised in the position of women, the NGOs with the largest financial resources for political communication systematically militate in favour of notions of ‘reproductive health’ to the detriment of more serious and urgent needs, thus offering unfailing support to the European and American delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, if this conference was ultimately a success for women all over the world, that was mainly thanks to the realism and resistance of the poorest countries, which were able to by-pass Western ideological polemics about sexuality to promote practical measures against poverty – like ‘micro-credit’, against international trafficking in women and against lack of education and medical provision.</p>
<p class="contents">If the voice of the poorest countries was finally able to make itself heard last Saturday around 4 a.m. despite pressure of all kinds, we owe that to respect for essential principles, the only guarantees of realistic and moderate international policy, I mean the principles of national sovereignty and equality between States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, the UN showed renewed respect for the rules of consensus after ignoring them for such a long time, and that respect made it possible to focus the negotiations on the real needs of women. We are glad the European Union has applauded this victory for women and respect for national sovereignty by adopting the final document.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The more sensitive the issue, the greater sensitivity must be shown in dealing with it. This was obviously not the case, neither in New York during the Beijing + 5 conference, nor in our debate in this Parliament yesterday. In the treatment of Poland and other candidate countries, fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity and the political values of this Parliament, as indeed of the new Europe we are in the process of creating, were not respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments put forward by the EU delegation in New York do not and could not represent a consensus position of the Member States of the Union: on the contrary, certain of these amendments flagrantly contravened the constitution of my country of Ireland, and I have no doubt the legislative position of other countries which seek to diminish rather than promote the practice of abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding paragraph H of this resolution, "sexual rights" is an undefined term not included in Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty nor in the Beijing + 5 Platform for Action. This new undefined term causes great difficulty for many countries including mine, as it could for example imply support for the sexual rights of paedophiles. I will therefore abstain from voting on this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Robert Schuman Declaration, the father of Europe. We would surely want to uphold the spirit, the ideals, and the values which formed the foundation of our European unity. Part of the Schuman legacy is to respect the diversity of Europe and the emerging cultures of the developing world. Consensus should be our motif, not imposition or intimidation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the forecourt of the Parliament a shameful demonstration is – probably still – in progress. A large group of young Italians with Lega Nord flags are calling out insults to the effect that the Italian flag should be burnt and shouting “Down with the Italians!”. They are also shouting unrepeatable insults at the President of the European Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I am under the impression that the groups of visitors who come here to Parliament and who meet with the Members do so with the intention of familiarising themselves with the European institutions, not to insult them. I imagine that the Member who invited them did so in order to make them aware that we spend money on making the European citizens aware of the process of European integration. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the President of Parliament and yourself should be informed of this matter, so that the Member who is responsible for this group will have to answer for this incident. I do not see any Members who belong to the Forza Italia party in the Chamber. Forza Italia is the largest political force of the Italian Freedom Alliance, which includes this party, the Lega Nord, which is now part of their coalition. This matter must be dealt with, for it is unthinkable that we should have to put up with this type of demonstration taking place inside Parliament in the name of democracy, open doors and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive me Mr President, but I feel that these matters must be dealt with while the time is ripe, for otherwise, if we do not speak out, these demonstrations will end up being perceived as the norm. Apart from anything else, the Italian tricolour is flying up there among the flags which are part of the symbols of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
