<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Douglas Alexander, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, today’s debate here in the European Parliament is indeed timely. I know that a number of you follow developments in Iran closely and I look forward to exchanging views with honourable Members in the course of our discussion this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran now has a new President and Government. They will need to take important decisions about reform, foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme. The choices they will make affect not just Iran’s future in the region, but also some of Europe’s vital interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran has vast potential: it has a young, well-educated population, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30. Many Iranians are highly entrepreneurial. Combined with Iran’s immense natural resources – particularly oil and minerals – this should make for a vibrant economy and society if the new government can create a culture of opportunity based upon the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1998 the European Union has pursued a policy of engagement with Iran. Our engagement is motivated by our strong desire to encourage progress in areas where Iran’s policies are of serious concern. These include Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, its approach to terrorism and the Middle East peace process, and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on two of those issues today: human rights – because I know this is of great concern to many honourable Members of this Parliament – and the nuclear issue, because it has the potential, if not handled correctly, to overshadow the entirety of Iran’s relationships with the international community, including the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore start with the latter. When Iran’s concealment of crucial elements of its nuclear programme came to light in 2002 and 2003, the normal procedure should have been for the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council. We decided to look for a way forward that would give Iran an opportunity to dispel concerns and prove that the aims of its nuclear programme were entirely peaceful. The IAEA Board agreed to delay a report to the Security Council to give a European initiative a chance. At the heart of this initiative was a proposal that Iran should restore confidence by suspending all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities while we discussed mutually acceptable, long-term arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should set out that no one – not the European Union nor the wider international community – is trying to prevent Iran from generating electricity by nuclear power, as Iran has sometimes claimed. In the proposals we made to Iran in August, the European side specifically offered support ‘for the development of a safe, economically viable and proliferation-proof civil nuclear power generation and research programme’. Our main objective has always been to get Iran to take the steps necessary to establish confidence that the intentions of its nuclear programme are exclusively peaceful.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members are aware, in August Iran decided to resume uranium-conversion activities, which the IAEA Board had asked it to suspend as an essential step. Full suspension of all nuclear fuel cycle activities was also the basis of the agreement made in Paris last November between Iran and the European side, which has provided the framework for our discussion of long-term arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">We have urged Iran to reinstate a full suspension and come back to talks on the basis of the Paris agreement. The European Union has made clear that we are willing to work with Iran and, as part of a long-term agreement, to open the door to closer economic, political and social cooperation. The resolution passed by the IAEA Board of Governors on 24 September makes clear the depth of international concern at Iran’s decision. It remains to be seen how Iran will respond. Iran has an opportunity now to come into line with requests made by the IAEA Board. We hope it will choose that constructive path.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to human rights, an area in which the United Kingdom Presidency has had cause to be active in the last three months, because of serious and continuing violations. During the first term of office of President Khatami from 1997 to 2001, there emerged a lively free press, a growing civil society and embryonic political parities. Progress was halting but nonetheless real. Regrettably, Iran has lost ground in these areas over the last few years. I hope Iran’s new Government will devote renewed attention to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the areas in which Iran is not living up to its international obligations is in the punishment of juvenile offenders. We continue to receive reports of children being sentenced to death and, in some horrendous instances, the sentences appear to have been carried out. Sentencing people to death for crimes committed when under the age of 18 is a clear violation of Iran’s obligations under international law. In January, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child urged Iran to end this practice. It is clearly imperative that it should happen. The European Union has pressed Iran to ensure that no such sentences are passed and to bring in without delay new legislation that will outlaw them.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months freedom of expression has also suffered. Numerous human rights defenders, journalists and web bloggers have been arrested. I know that many honourable Members are equally concerned about these issues. I want, therefore, to mention in particular the inspirational investigative journalist, human rights defender and now prisoner of conscience, Akbar Ganji, who remains in the jail where he has spent much of the last five years. The European Union has called for his release on several occasions and I today hope the Iranian authorities will now consider this as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about religious freedom: many of Iran’s religious minorities continue to suffer persecution and unfair treatment. We take the view that, by pursuing a policy of diplomatic engagement, we have a better chance of persuading Iran to improve its human rights performance. We constantly monitor Iran’s human rights situation and the Presidency has recently made a number of urgent representations on cases requiring immediate intervention. European Union Member States remain ready to co-sponsor United Nations General Assembly resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Iran human rights dialogue enables the European Union to work to improve the human rights situation in Iran. We would like to see much greater commitment from Iran to the dialogue and to ensuring that the dialogue results in real progress achieved on the ground. We are frankly disappointed that Iran has not yet agreed dates for the next round and will continue to press it. Iran’s attitude to human rights is damaging its reputation in the international community and I am sure that honourable Members will agree with me when I say that the Iranian Government owes it to its people to make significant progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all realise that this is a particularly crucial time for Iran and its new Government. For our part, we remain committed to seeking progress in our areas of concern through a policy of engagement. I know that honourable Members will also continue to maintain a keen interest in human rights, the nuclear dossier and other elements of Iran’s development in the important months and years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, in the current climate it is inevitable that discussions about Iran focus on its nuclear programme. This is one of the most serious security issues currently on the international agenda. The international community must be united if we are to find a satisfactory solution. This means working through the appropriate channels: first, the International Atomic Energy Agency and, if and when necessary, the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the European Union’s relations with Iran is conditioned in large part by progress on that issue and by the approach of the international community. Our relationship with Iran, however, does not begin and end with the nuclear track. Other tracks with Iran should, in the Commission’s view, continue to be pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I wish to express my appreciation for the work undertaken by the delegation for relations with Iran, under the dynamic chairwomanship of Ms Angelika Beer. I hope that in the months ahead you will be in a position to develop contacts with your interlocutors from the Iranian Majlis, as well as with the widest possible spectrum of Iranian society.</p>
<p class="contents">People-to-people links are the best way to overcome prejudice, negative stereotypes and to foster mutual understanding. It would be, for instance, very important to support the further development of academic, cultural and artistic exchanges between Europe and Iran, two ancient beacons of civilisations which have a lot to offer to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">On the official level, I first wish to draw your attention to two tracks: the comprehensive dialogue and the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The comprehensive dialogue is the successor to the critical dialogue. It is a forum designed to allow both sides to discuss a broad range of issues in the economic, political and security fields in a frank and open manner. Since the outset, the emphasis has been placed on our four long-standing issues of concern: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, the Middle East peace process and human rights. We believe that this dialogue, which has played a useful role in the past, should now be continued. The next session should be held in Tehran. We are waiting for Iran to make practical suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the more specific bilateral dialogue on human rights which we set up in 2002, it provides a structured forum which allows formal discussion on individual cases, as well as on a comprehensive range of human rights issues of concern, on the basis of clear benchmarks. It also comprises a round table involving a wide range of civil society actors, as well as parliamentarians. It remains one of the means through which the EU can make a sustained contribution to fostering systemic change and improving the human rights situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the latest session of the human rights dialogue took place more than a year ago. We sought to hold a session in September, but this proved impossible in the absence of any confirmation from the Iranian side. In the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner told Mr Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian Foreign Minister, that it would be important for Iran to reconfirm its commitment to the EU-Iran human rights dialogue by agreeing on a date for an early meeting. We are still waiting for Iran’s response.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the current human rights situation in Iran, there is a growing cause for concern, as exemplified by the continued imprisonment of Mr Akbar Ganji – as Mr Alexander mentioned – and his supporter and lawyer, Mr Abdolfattah Soltani. There are other serious issues of concern which have emerged recently: the juvenile death penalty cases despite the existence of a moratorium on this penalty; the arrest of members of the Baha’i faith; the excessive use of force to suppress unrest in the provinces of Khuzestan and Kurdistan; and the continued suppressions of freedom of the press. Each is a matter of deep concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission remains mobilised on each of these issues. We are fully in line with the European Parliament in saying that, without a systemic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with Iran cannot develop properly. Indeed, our relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran is, at present, well below potential: Iran is one of the few countries with which the EU has no contractual relation.</p>
<p class="contents">A framework agreement with the EU could facilitate the reintegration of Iran into the international community and contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to economic growth and job creation. This should, in turn, consolidate the indigenous reform process leading towards a more open society. As the presidential campaign demonstrated, these are indeed among the most pertinent demands of the Iranian electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2002, the Commission has led talks for the conclusion of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement – TCA – with Iran. They run parallel to the negotiations led by the EU Presidency for a Political Dialogue Agreement – PDA. These two tracks are indivisible and mutually reinforcing. They are also dependent on the overall political atmosphere. You may recall, when the nuclear crisis first erupted back in 2003, that we had to place our TCA and PDA discussions on hold. These were resumed only after the signature of the November 2004 Paris agreement, which helped to re-establish a more favourable political environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The eighth – and so far last – round of negotiations took place in Tehran on 12 and 13 July 2005. Indeed, up and until the most recent crisis over the nuclear issue, our negotiators had made good progress.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to say a few words on where we stand with regard to the nuclear issue, including its implications on the TCA since the adoption of the resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency of 24 September. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 3 October confirmed that the EU remains firmly united around the European Union E3 Troika approach. This strong sense of EU solidarity around the E3 position forms the platform around which the united international community can rally to strengthen the hand and to support the excellent efforts displayed by the IAEA and its Director-General, Mr Mohammad ElBaradei.</p>
<p class="contents">A united EU can also form the bedrock upon which the international community can send a clear message to Iran that, whilst as per Article IV of the Non Proliferation Treaty – NPT – Iran has the inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes – and this without discrimination – we need objective guarantees on the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the EU considers that the integrity of the NPT must be preserved, and that international cooperation must take place within the strict limits set by the NPT and the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. These principles underpin the framework set up last November in Paris by the European countries. The comprehensive package presented to Iran last August represents a solid pillar on which Iran and the international community can find a common ground for their legitimate concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also played its part. Following the resumption of conversion activities at the Isfahan plant two months ago, we decided to put the negotiations we were leading for a trade and cooperation agreement on hold. The Commission strongly hopes that the Iranian leadership will accurately assess what the stakes are and will, as a result, take the necessary steps to reverse the current unhelpful trend, including ensuring full cooperation with international organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where human rights are concerned, this House will not compromise. Being generally opposed to the death penalty, we will be all the more energetic in demanding that a stop be put to the execution of juveniles and that the death penalty should not be imposed on any person who was aged under 18 when they committed the crime. I am also grateful to the presidency for being equally forthright about the resumption of the human rights dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">What we expect of the Commission is that it should make funds available from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to enable us to step up cooperation with Iranian civil society, and I am obliged to Commissioner Figel’ for mentioning a number of areas in which we can do that. In the absence of any substantial improvement in the human rights situation, it will be impossible to bring negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The same cause and effect relationship is present in relation to the nuclear issues, which are equally crucial to the further development of relations with the EU. While we welcome every effort at cooperation with the IAEA in order to make effective monitoring possible, we do – quite independently of that – urge Iran, as a matter of priority, to completely suspend its own uranium enrichment programme, as agreed in Paris last November.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Iranians to resume dialogue with the EU before the Board of Governors of the IAEA next meet, in November. They know that the European Union has offered to supply enriched uranium for civilian purposes. Russia, to take one example, might well offer to do likewise – and there will then be the possibility of sending the spent fuel rods back – but Iran should take practical steps to address the mistrust in which it is held, not least in nuclear matters. If it does that, it cannot fail; if it does not, it will have the Security Council to deal with, where its chances of successes will be slimmer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, however, to state right away and without ambiguity that we rule out any kind of military solution to this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, we call on the United States Administration to become involved in these negotiations, as it did with some success in the case of North Korea. We are, actually, concerned by this difference in the attitude of the United States, partly because many of Iran’s concerns about its own security spring directly from the attitude of the US, its policy in the region and the pressure that is being exerted, partly in military terms, in the military bases located in areas bordering Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran, for its part, must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purposes; it must do so because it has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus also undertaking to apply its Additional Protocol. We therefore fully support the resolution by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which mandated its Director General, Dr El Baradei – who has since been deservedly awarded the Nobel Prize for peace – to continue to pursue the path of negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the European Council’s resolution of 3 October. Our endorsement is not at all a formality, since we believe that this approach is particularly wise. Indeed, as is well known and as the Iranian authorities are well aware and as Mr Alexander also pointed out, this issue falls within the competence of the United Nations Security Council. The decision not to launch a procedure which could lead to an escalation of the situation is thus a choice which makes the path of negotiation even more persuasive, offering Iran a chance which should not be missed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of greater clarity I should state that Iran, like any country in the world, has the right to equip itself with nuclear capacity for non-military purposes, and that is clear both in the resolution from the International Agency for Atomic Energy and in our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with an appeal to the Council on the issue of human rights, an issue that everyone has alluded to. In our resolution we referred to the cases mentioned by you, Mr Alexander. I would like to encourage the Commission and the Council to continue the policy of dialogue, and never to separate human rights issues from trade agreements with Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several countries such as Argentina and the Republic of South Africa have decided not to pursue programmes of this nature. Also, countries such as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine that inherited nuclear weapons following the break-up of the Soviet Union have generally determined not to use them. Unfortunately, however, this process has not received the support it needed to ensure its full success.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of countries failed to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and despite strong pressure by world public opinion have gone ahead and acquired such weapons. I have in mind Israel, Pakistan and India. As a result, other countries have determined to follow their example.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today discussing one such country, namely Iran. The fears that the process may go further seem entirely justified and it is imperative to put an end to this domino effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has now reached an impasse in its negotiations, and it is therefore vitally important to refer the matter to the United Nations. We must call on the UN Security Council to act swiftly and efficiently in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to remember to whom we are indebted for information on the secret military nuclear programmes in Iran. The Iranian opposition brought this activity to the attention of world public opinion, and their significant contribution to this case should be duly recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it would also be appropriate to consider another issue that has been outstanding for some time. It concerns declaring the Iranian Mujahedin a terrorist organisation. Parliament raised this thorny issue once before, and I hope the Council will take it up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our debate today is being held at a time when nobody knows what is going to happen next, so – not least in view of the various resolutions we are to vote on tomorrow – we should argue them through very precisely. It is the details that will determine whether we in this House meet our responsibility of finding a de-escalation strategy, which I would describe as being about opening up new negotiating options in furtherance of our policy objective of preventing further proliferation of weapons in the Middle East and Iran’s eventual possession of an atom bomb.</p>
<p class="contents">My group sees de-escalation as being achievable, but not – as we have learned from Iraq – by invoking the Security Council. Our fear is that failure to present a united front to the Security Council will result in escalation, and that the IAEA will no longer be able to do its work in Iran without hindrance, something that we know will end up making military escalation more likely.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not doubt that we agree on the objective, and we must seek ways to keep the doors open, for the people of Iran – the people we are in contact with, the journalists who we know, the human rights organisations, not to mention the Nobel prize-winners – have expectations of us; they also expect us to give diplomacy a chance. On that point, I endorse what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said. We have spoken to them this week; we have to turn our backs on the Security Council and seek political solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are worried about human rights for the same reasons. It is not usual for us to talk constantly about human rights, but the human rights dialogue is one of the things that have been put on ice since President Ahmadinejad was elected, and the human rights situation is getting worse. Teheran has sent official representatives to listen to this debate, and I appeal to them to clarify for our information whether or not Akbar Ganji is still alive, to ensure that he is released at once without conditions, along with his lawyer, who was a guest of this House as recently as July and discussed these issues with us. That is what our resolution is driving at, and I mean this very seriously. I would be glad of support from the Commission and the Council in achieving this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from the serious environmental objections to nuclear energy, there is no reason why countries in Asia should not raise their level of technology to that of Europe and North America. It only becomes an issue if that knowledge is misused to issue military threats to others.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, this risk is real, because the regime that is in power in Iran owes its support to a militant minority that has driven out, and excluded, other political powers from that country. This minority does not only want a theocratic system in Iran – one that is, among other things, characterised by the disadvantaged position of women and the widespread practice of capital punishment – but also throughout the rest of the world. Furthermore, it intensely dislikes freedom of association, freedom of opinion, equal access to political power and scope for individual choice. They justify their regime of terror with their own interpretation of the will of God, which makes them immune to rational argument.</p>
<p class="contents">The political opposition has been banished to Europe and elsewhere. A democratic Europe must take this opposition seriously. Attempting to delay the nuclear threat by means of a temporary compromise with the regime in Iran should never be at the expense of our solidarity with this opposition. This opposition is our hope for a better Iran in future, where people enjoy the freedoms and rights that we in Europe take for granted. Support for that opposition can, in time, change the situation. That is why parts of that opposition, such as the People’s Mujahedeen, should not be on the terror list.</p>
<p class="contents">A possible military intervention, however, similar to that initiated by the Americans against Iran’s neighbours, Iraq and Afghanistan, in recent years, would give the people in Iran the feeling that their country is being threatened from outside and should therefore be defended. That would only play into the hands of the fundamentalist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Europe’s choice must be clear. It must pledge its solidarity with the democratic opposition both within Iran and outside it, and emphatically reject any military intervention by outsiders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This long arm of those in power of the Islamic Republic is surely one with which the British Presidency is far from unfamiliar today. Teheran's terrorist tentacles even reach as far as the south of its neighbour, Iraq. This long arm is the cause of the brutal repression that persists at home and of the serious destabilisation abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and Commission ought to give due consideration to these murky credentials of Iran’s regime, particularly if this regime of terror proclaims, mysteriously, to have purely peaceful nuclear intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Council and Commission how we can prevent this long arm of the mullahs from resorting to nuclear weapons. You will in any event have to make the political price for President Ahmadinejad unacceptably high. In concrete terms, this means that we, together with the US administration, should really keep all the options open where Tehran is concerned. After all, the mullahs are quite capable of eating humble pie on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">If the United Nations do not come up with an effective containment strategy against Iran’s dangerous atomic aspirations, there is no doubt that the states that feel threatened most will take measures themselves. That option must also sound familiar to the Council and the Commission. One thing is certain: as peace brokers for the Middle East, they must resolutely denounce and reject the blood-spattered long arm of the mullahs, both in principle and in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that it was in fact Iran’s nuclear programme that provoked the most animated debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members’ opinions now also display both a demand for more constructive action in relation to Iran and a wish not to strain relations with that country. Our resolution is in the same vein as announcements during recent days from the Council and the Atomic Energy Agency. These have emphasised political dialogue as the most appropriate instrument for convincing Iran. This confirms that, in truth, the choice of resources available for influencing Iran is extremely limited. We should not forget, however, that this is already the third European Parliament resolution on Iran this year. We should also bear in mind the resolutions by other international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">What sort of response have these received? Iran’s reply has been unmistakable — the violation of the Paris agreement and other agreements, the concealment of violations and the resumption of the generation of energy for nuclear weapons. Nor is the Atomic Energy Agency wrong in stating in its resolution of 24 September that Iran’s activities were giving rise to a lack of confidence and that further action would fall within the competence of the UN Security Council. Given this, we have to understand that political dialogue as a preventive tool to deal with Iran’s defiant and provocative actions is approaching its critical limit. This, however, creates the sense that both in today’s resolution and in the Council’s announcement of 3 October the determination to take this issue forward to the UN Security Council is lacking. Perhaps this is because the Council and we at the European Parliament are actually not convinced about the UN Security Council’s will to take decisions in connection with Iran’s nuclear programme. I hope that I am wrong, but it seems that the recent decisions by the international community still allow Iran’s ruling circles to act as they see fit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that being gathered here today is the only clear aim.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to stop Iran from completing its nuclear fuel cycle. We have to stop enrichment as a conversion-related activity which is not allowed and covered by NPT.

We need to be equally clear and determined, however, in refusing any type of bargaining over the serious contraventions of human rights which still exist, especially in the field of freedom of expression and of women’s and children’s rights, where we are still very far from being secure in the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution should be seen by Tehran as a sincere, clear call for the continuation of negotiations and ought also to act as a useful step towards the involvement of the other major protagonist in this delicate issue, the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are dramatically reminded every day in Iraq, the use of force, unilateralism and regime changes imposed by the use of arms are the perfect ingredients for a disaster foretold. Only a multilateral, determined and transparent effort will make it possible to create the conditions in which Iran will no longer be seen just as a danger but, on the contrary, as an essential player that has a vital role in stabilising the world’s most strategic region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Iran the human rights situation has deteriorated after the new President was ‘elected’. In particular, the situation of women and young people has worsened considerably. The number of public executions has increased. The regime has been condemned in the UN for violations of human rights more times than any other country in the world: 51 times.</p>
<p class="contents">All hopes of Iran moving towards moderation have now evaporated. There are also many reports of the Iranian regime becoming increasingly involved in Iraq in an attempt to set up a sister Islamic state. Tehran has also decided not to respect any of its agreements with the EU with regard to nuclear programming, including the Paris agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Iran’s main demands concerns the People’s Mujahedin Resistance Movement. They were put on the terror list about three years ago without any legal basis. Many MEPs in the House as well as the majority in the British, Belgium and Italian Parliaments have called for the removal of the Mujahedin from this list. We believe the only way to improve democracy in Iran is to support the main opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a third factor is becoming apparent: Iran’s role in training and equipping insurgents in Iraq who are not only killing British and American soldiers, but also working to ensure that Iraq’s painful transformation to a democratic state is unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="contents">If Iraq does not successfully transform into a democratic state, then the whole region will be destabilised. Mr Figeľ had nothing much to say except to offer more of the process of proffered dialogue and cooperation. As the British Government has discovered over the last few years, this approach has so far not yielded much success.</p>
<p class="contents">The seriousness of the situation and the difficulty in resolving it peacefully cannot be overstated, but it will not be solved by the European Union. Once again the EU presumes to take on the attributes of a political state. The serious situation posed by Iran must be addressed by the properly constituted sovereign states working within the properly constituted international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU successfully develops its European defence identity – that is, an EU military force – and if Turkey becomes a member of the EU, then a militarised EU will share a border not only with Iran, but also with Iraq and Syria.

The IAEA’s Board of Governors stated on 24 September that past experience had led it to have no confidence that Iran’s nuclear programme was for peaceful purposes only.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean? It surely means that it is not just our relations with Iran that are at stake, but also the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the dangers that result from more and more regimes getting their hands on nuclear weapons. Along with the ever-increasing flow of reports of executions of juveniles under the age of 18 and of others being sentenced to death, there is also the fact that Akbar Gandji, having been arrested over five years ago, is still in jail and is in a critical condition.</p>
<p class="contents">One cannot fail to get the impression that Iran is using the European Union as a means of buying time for its programme. It would also appear that Iran is working on the assumption that the European Union will, in future, still not have the capacity for joint action – something that was lamentably apparent to us from our experience with Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this is not the time for sympathetic resolutions and friendly visits; instead, we must present a united front in order to make it plain to Iran that it is harming itself by persisting on this perilous course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, let me start by making it clear, including to the last-but-one speaker, that we would not be where we are today without the painstaking work of the ‘EU-3’.</p>
<p class="contents">Members across this House have called for a stronger, more decisive European foreign policy. Our negotiations with Iran have represented just such an example of what we can do when we work together. That is why it is right that today’s resolution calls for renewed negotiations, seeks to engage third countries internationally in support of our efforts and not as an alternative to them, and should be within the framework of the Paris agreement of last November. In that context I am proud that the British Foreign Secretary said on 28 September ‘there is no question of us going to war against Iran, this can only be resolved by diplomatic means and by diplomatic pressure’.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s resolution is also right in saying that the breaking-off of the EU’s human rights dialogue with Iran should be treated as seriously as the breakdown of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme. Indeed, Tehran seeks to justify the arrest of human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani by labelling him as a nuclear spy. Whilst Mr ElBaradei should be warmly congratulated for his Nobel Peace Prize, let us not forget today the former Nobel Prize winner, Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who is currently in receipt of personal threats against her because of her work. The political and human rights issues are intertwined and again I welcome the assurances given this afternoon by the President-in-Office in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this morning further evidence came forward of the possible involvement of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in providing armour-piercing infra-red bomb technology to insurgents in Iraq. Whilst I cannot attest to these claims with certainty, when eight soldiers from my own country, the UK, have been killed in Iraq in the last five months it is right that Europe does its utmost to dissuade Iran from the proliferation of civil as well as nuclear weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is the issue of Iran’s attempts over the last 20 years to master uranium enrichment technology in a covert fashion with aid from Pakistan’s A. Q. Khan and his nuclear technology bazaar. It is clear to any Iran watcher that its hard-line fundamentalist government, in spite of its public denials, is determined to acquire a nuclear bomb and that enriching uranium to military grade is central to its security strategy. Paragraph 12 of the resolution, therefore, is particularly appeasing in this respect and unacceptable. As Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, this is also totally out of the question. I fully support the recent resolution of the IAEA which paves the way for an eventual referral to the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe all options must be left open to prevent nuclear proliferation. We do not want a repeat of the example of North Korea, which got away with withdrawing from the NPT. And by the way, what did Nobel Peace Prize Laureate ElBaradei and the IAEA do to prevent the DPRK’s acquiring of nuclear weapons?</p>
<p class="contents">If it comes to UN sanctions Iran could usefully be denied access to the uranium ore as a raw material as it has only got about 35 tonnes of yellow cake uranium at present, which is enough to make one or two bombs at most. I also agree that Iran has an appalling human rights record, including executing minors for sexual misdemeanours, and even pregnant women. I believe it is the only country in the world which executes pregnant women.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I condemn Iran’s role through its terrorist proxy Hizbollah– which I call again on the Council to ban – in supporting the insurgency in Iraq and in supplying sophisticated bombs which are killing British and American soldiers and therefore preventing peace, the establishment of democracy and the reconstruction of that blighted country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political system in Iran does not comply with internationally agreed standards concerning fundamental human rights and political freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we condemn the application of the death penalty to young offenders and the threatened application of the death penalty to juveniles in that country. The authorities in Iran impose severe restrictions on the media. These restrictions include censorship of the Internet, which is one of the few sources of independent information available in Iran. We are concerned that further arrests of Internet bloggers and Internet users have taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">We appeal in the first instance to the Iranian Parliament to act in defence of freedom of the media and freedom of expression by the Iranian people both in traditional publications and on the Internet.</p>

We support the IAEA in calling for the matter of Iran’s nuclear programme to be referred to the UN Security Council. Tehran must publish all the documents relating to its nuclear programme.

The joint resolution carefully presents a line of justifications for Iran’s nuclear programme. At the same time, the well-known ultimate goal of the Iranian Government is already not a distant one.</p>
<p class="contents">We must state clearly that there is a real danger as the terrorist and terrorist-supporting fundamentalist state is going to obtain nuclear weaponry by ‘confusing and deceiving stupid Europeans’, as it was openly described in July 2005 by the head of Iran’s nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament marginalises this great danger to international peace and to the future of democracies, this Parliament will marginalise itself. Paradoxically, the only effective opposition to the rulers of the terrorist state was put on the terrorist list and persecuted in Europe. If the Mujahideen movement were taken off this list, it would be a real and sound European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the resolution. Special pro-Iranian and American warning points, as stated in Amendment 12, if adopted, would be politically unwise and counter-productive. Two amendments – the first and fourth – introduce the clause about the Security Council, which is to be supported. Possible opposition to it should be explained as a service for Russia, in order to prevent it from an unpleasant veto in the Security Council. I do not understand why the European Union should lose face in order to save Russia’s. In the event of such a veto, we would realise how strategically reliable our alleged strategic partner really is. If Amendment 1 is rejected, the whole resolution has no sense but prevailing surrender. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think it needs to be reiterated that what the troika and the EU bodies offered in the course of the dialogue is a balanced strategy in relation to Iran. It is true to say that there is no built-in guarantee of success, but there is no alternative to it. Any one of the military options mentioned in this debate would be politically disastrous, quite apart from the question of whether or not it would be workable. That is something that has to be made abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of my fellow-Members who have spoken in the course of the last hour also need to be reminded that we have already had experience of a situation – in Europe, too – in which two powers, armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, were squaring up to each other. If it had not been for their ability to consider each other’s security interests from each other’s point of view, there would have been neither a Non-Proliferation Treaty nor disarmament, and we might well have already been through a nuclear war. I would have been killed in it, and so, probably, for that matter, would those who have been sounding off in a bellicose fashion. That is something for us to think about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that we have to be able to include in our calculations the legitimate security interests of other regimes – even of this one. It makes sense to have a strategy that offers them something, but we should not rule out the possibility of using the Security Council as a means of exerting pressure; to do so would be politically foolish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I pay tribute to the other colleagues in the E3 process who have shown the strength of Europe’s diplomatic voice in challenging circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of honourable Members raised the issue of human rights. There is no reason why an Islamic political system such as Iran should deny fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of choice and freedom of expression. There can be no excuse for any system abusing human rights. Ms Beer and others echoed the appeal that I made earlier to Tehran to free Mr Ganji and to reinforce the significance of the wider human rights agenda within Iran. I reaffirm that call and let me echo the comments made by Commissioner Figel’, Mr Howitt and others on Mr Soltani.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise that the United Nations Security Council has a potentially significant role to play. I recognise that a number of contributions questioned the role of the Security Council. Let there be little doubt in this House, however, that the prospect of a report to the United Nations Security Council remains real. The responsibility in terms of the immediate steps that now need to be taken lies directly with the Iranian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of military intervention has again been raised by a number of different honourable colleagues in the course of the debate – Mr Napoletano, Ms Beer, Mr Howitt and others – who expressed their concern at the possibility of military action being taken against Iran. I would simply reiterate that on 3 October 2005, European Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the European Union’s support for a diplomatic solution to international concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme, which should include an agreement on long-term arrangements. Such a solution would help create the climate for a better relationship with Europe and with the wider international community.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned earlier, working and engaging with Iran will be a challenge. But we must all do our best to meet that challenge. The benefits to Iran and its people, to its neighbours and to the wider international community are literally incalculable. Our preference remains to aim for a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperation on our shared interests. Europe wants to see Iran realise its potential and to grow and prosper. That is what its young population deserves. But a relationship of this sort will also need to address the European Union’s main concerns as reaffirmed today by so many honourable Members within this Chamber. Those concerns unequivocally include both the issue of nuclear proliferation and the related issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Iran is at a particularly crucial juncture. The world is watching to see how its new government will manage its economic and social policies and to see if it will be a responsible partner as judged by how it deals with international concerns such as human rights and non-proliferation. I believe that the message from this Chamber as regards the priorities of the European Union will be clearer now than at the beginning of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
