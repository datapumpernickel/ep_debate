<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nisticò (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I would like to express my immense satisfaction at the adoption in committee on 23 April last of the directive setting quality and safety standards for blood, essentially without any significant shift from Parliament’s position and amendments. At last, I feel that a directive can be adopted at second reading which provides the greatest possible guarantees, particularly for patients and consumers, of the quality and safety of blood and its components in order to avoid infections and complications such as those which have caused so many scandals and disasters in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of a new European directive laying down uniform quality standards for blood will, at last, allow the free movement of blood and its components throughout the countries of the European Union and the removal of unwanted restrictions on the movement of donors from one country to another. There will have to be high quality and safety standards for all the stages of the transfusion process, from donation to testing by means of specific, updated laboratory tests, to the collection, processing, storage, distribution and use of human blood and blood components.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you will all remember, the point of the directive which was most critical and most disputed in our committee and in the House concerned what are known as ‘voluntary unpaid donations’. In my opinion, the common position adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy resolves all the disputes over this point. Indeed, Article 4 states, according to the principle of subsidiarity, ‘This directive shall not prevent a Member State from maintaining or introducing ... more stringent protective measures .... In particular, a Member State may introduce requirements for voluntary, unpaid donations, including the restriction of imports of blood and blood components’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy deleted the clause ‘provided that the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty are met’. A new amendment has now been tabled by the socialists to the effect that all the Member States may prohibit or restrict imports of blood and blood components to secure a high level of protection of health and to achieve the objectives laid down in Article 19(1), provided that the conditions laid down by the Treaty are met. This seems to me to be a good, acceptable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to voluntary and unpaid donations, Article 19 of the common position lays down a number of specific provisions, including, in particular (Paragraph 1) that Member States are to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations and ensure that blood is in so far as possible provided from such donations. I feel that this is a very balanced provision and this position has already been endorsed in committee. Article 19(2) lays down in general terms that the Member States are to inform the other Member States and the Commission of the actions taken by them to achieve the objective set out in Paragraph 1. In this regard, I would like to table an oral amendment requiring the Member States to provide this information every three years instead of every two years, for this tallies with the text of a subsequent article.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, still on the subject of voluntary unpaid donations, some of the Members called for the Council of Europe definition to be included in the text, particularly in Article 3. I broadly support the Council of Europe definition but I feel that it is sufficient for reference to be made to it in recital 23, precisely as it is currently worded, to the effect that this definition ‘should’ – not ‘must’ be taken into account by the Member States. I therefore oppose both Amendment No 7 and Amendment No 19, which seek to include a literal, rigid definition of ‘voluntary and unpaid donation’. Indeed, I feel that some flexibility is necessary in order to encourage donors. Commissioner, each Member State has a different attitude, different traditions and a different culture when it comes to the definition of ‘unpaid’, which I feel must be wholly respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for Europe to impose rigid definition criteria on the individual Member States. The important thing is to have enough donors to achieve the most important objective, which is to avoid a shortage of blood and blood components.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of controversy concerned the responsible person. In my opinion, there should be a compromise amendment giving Member States the freedom to choose the type of qualification required of the responsible person, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that this directive will, at last, see the light of day and be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I should like to leave at 11 a.m.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is not the first time that a very emotional and very passionate debate is taking place on the subject of the supply of blood. The opinions on this subject are diverse, even between my good friend, Mr Nisticò, and myself. We do however agree on one thing, namely that the safety of the supply of blood must be paramount because too many people rely on blood products. Patient organisations – and I would quote haemophiliac associations – were right to get involved in the debate, but their opinions are also diverse. Moreover, these different opinions run parallel with whether or not a Member State is self-sufficient in the organisation of the supply of blood and blood production.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a Member State where self-sufficiency is paramount, and the voluntary, unpaid donation, the so-called 'gratis principle', underlies the organisation of our supply of blood. I am not able, or prepared, to impose our principle on other countries, and I am talking to Mr Nisticò when I say this. He asked for subsidiarity a moment ago. This should not, and cannot, entail the undermining of our principle of voluntary 'gratis' self-sufficiency. For this reason, I would ask Mr Nisticò to bring up for discussion the principles that were laid down at first reading in Parliament and confirmed at second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. This means that we need to make a positive recommendation on the agreements in the framework of the trilogue, involving Mr Lund, Mr Nisticò and others, namely in order to continue to enable the Dutch people, the northern Member States, to maintain their own organisation, which is also the gist of Amendment No 19. Mr Nisticò, I am prepared to withdraw my support for Amendment No 7 if you can assure me, in the framework of this subsidiarity, that Amendment No 19 will also be supported, including by Members whose countries operate a different system.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to comment on a second amendment. We will support Amendment No 20, Mr Lund’s compromise to replace Amendment No 10, which enables a Member State to continue to determine its own organisation and its own blood policy. This is also backed by Mr Nisticò. This compromise receives my unqualified support, for I think it is an improvement on the original amendment which I had tabled on Amendment No 10. I should like to urge all of you once again to support Amendment No 19. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very welcome report and I congratulate our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety of blood, as we all know, is paramount. Some of our Member States have had horror stories to remind them of that. But the supply of blood is also paramount for those whose lives depend on it. Our preference is for unremunerated donation – that is the British practice and that is what we want to see – but, in practice, Europe imports nearly 50% of its plasma and plasma products.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not talking about the standard blood transfusion service that comes around to your church hall and you pop in for half an hour, have a cup of tea, and go back to work. I am talking about plasma donation, where you have to travel some distance to fixed machinery and it takes half a day. We have to import some of those products and a lot of them come from the United States, where many of the products are remunerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Research shows that remunerated blood is perfectly safe in itself. The key, of course, is the screening of blood products wherever they come from. The hyper-immune plasma products are nearly all imported into the European Union and 2,166,367 people in the European Union depend on them: some 400 thousand in Britain, 400 thousand in France, 100 thousand in the Netherlands, 40 thousand in Finland and so on. These are people with haemophilia, primary immune deficiency, albumen tetanus needs, acquired deficiencies, auto-immune diseases and Rhesus negative pregnant women. Without supplies, their health and their lives can be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we must encourage unremunerated donation. That is our custom and practice but in a world of BSE and CJD, we cannot be purists. Otherwise we are putting the lives of our fellow citizens at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As late as last week, we made an agreement with Mr Nisticò while the Commission and the Council were present, and this agreement led to our compromising by tabling Amendment No 19 through which the definition of unpaid blood donation is transferred to the recitals. This was a compromise, even though Mr Nisticò is now shaking his head. What is happening in this case is simply dishonest. What Mr Nisticò is doing is beneath all contempt, and I should therefore like to say that, in connection with the vote later today, you should be prepared for our requesting a postponement. I will not tolerate this approach. It is not the way to treat fellow MEPs in Parliament. Both the Commission and the Council, whose presidency was represented at the meeting in question, accepted this draft compromise, as did Mr Nisticò on behalf of his group and as rapporteur. To come here to the second reading in Parliament and, in spite of everything, state an unwillingness to stand by the agreement we had entered into is therefore quite extraordinary. That is in any case the last agreement I enter into with Mr Nisticò and, as I say, we shall do what we can to have the vote on this matter postponed so that we can have it debated in detail with the leaders of the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and with the coordinator of that group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. What has happened in this matter is simply awful, and we shall not tolerate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, for his cooperation throughout the process of putting this report together. I would like to add to Mr Lund’s comments that what I find unacceptable is the fact that a compromise discussed between two groups, without the participation of the shadow rapporteurs, at least, of the other, so-called smaller groups, is being presented as a parliamentary compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the liberal group, which I am representing here, considers that the common position adopted by the Council is an excellent compromise. It takes equal account of the concerns expressed by blood donors, in particular with regard to ethical requirements in the field of donations, and by patients, who are demanding that products derived from plasma be available as needed throughout Europe, as has been amply illustrated by Mr Bowis. In other words, any amendment whose effect might be to threaten this balance would appear to be dangerous, and I would add, in particular, that we believe fighting over the obligation for donations to be entirely without remuneration is a mistake, as making voluntary donations the sole method means favouring one national collection system over another, which would be completely counter to the Treaties. Why must we be forced to choose between the German mixed system, for example, the monopoly of the Red Cross in Belgium, or even the French system, which, since the tragic contaminated blood affair, has set up an effective blood monitoring system which many Member States now use as a model? That is not the key issue. The most important thing, and we would stress this, is to promote the highest possible quality and safety standards for donations of blood and blood components, and it is not by extolling the virtues of obligatorily entirely unpaid donations, I repeat, or by proposing assimilation – thus far scientifically unfounded on grounds of both ethics and quality, as stated by Amendments Nos 7 and 10 adopted in committee and Amendment No 26 – that we will be laying down proper foundations for the future of the blood sector in Europe and providing a practical, sustainable solution to the question of self-sufficiency. The liberal group will therefore vote against these amendments. Yes, of course you must listen to voluntary blood donors. Of course their contribution is priceless. But you must also listen to patients when they tell you that no one with haemophilia or primary immune deficiency will inject plasma products that are untreated or of uncertain quality just because they come from voluntary donors. The message we must send here and now to donors and recipients is one of generosity and solidarity. We believe it is unproductive to set their points of view against each other. The main threat to the blood sector and the lives of patients lies in the lack of medicinal products derived from plasma. It is in accepting this reality and accepting all healthy donors without excluding anybody that the battle for self-sufficiency will one day be won in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, however, some gaps, requiring amendments to be tabled with a view to ensuring the maximum level of safety of blood products.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider that all undesirable effects and incidents relating to any stage of the blood donation and transfusion process must be reported, no matter how serious they are. We also consider that it is genuinely essential, in the interests of quality and patient information, for a medical examination to be carried out on all blood donors before blood is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question of remuneration for blood donations is fundamental. Most European countries have a system of voluntary, unpaid blood donations. We cannot accept any challenges to this principle, and we believe it should be extended to the whole of the European Union. From an ethical point of view, we cannot defend the idea of selling blood or, indeed, any other component of the body. The human body is not a commodity. In this respect, we find it extremely shocking that companies can make a profit from free blood donations.</p>
<p class="contents">The remuneration of donations could be counter-productive in terms of quality. Donors motivated by financial gain might be led to deny any health problems they may have, which could have tragic consequences – as in China – for their own health and for the health of recipients. I am not denying the risks in terms of blood supplies, but I think we can motivate potential donors by means other than money.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in order to ensure that the objectives of this directive, the quality and safety of human blood, are achieved that I am calling on my fellow Members to vote for our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the plasma used to supply the EU market, 73% originates from people who receive remuneration for donating it. It is only through these donors that full supplies of plasma products can be kept up. Secure supplies of blood products save lives and must therefore be given absolute priority. The Common Position is a good basis for this.</p>
<p class="contents">A ban on remunerated donation is not feasible in terms of health care provision. I can see nothing immoral in this – quite the opposite. I remember my own student days, when we students derived part of our income from donating plasma.</p>

The European Parliament has examined this directive setting standards of quality and safety for blood and blood products very closely, because we need to use strict scientific criteria to describe the terms and conditions which must be met in order to safeguard the health of both donors and recipients of blood and blood products to the maximum. Incidents such as we have seen in the past in the European Union, where people have lost their lives due to contaminated blood, must not be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the European Commission adopted a series of important amendments at first reading; however, it also needs to look favourably on another series which it rejected at first reading, but which has been re-tabled and re-adopted in the Committee on the Environment. I should like, if I may, to comment on a number of them. I consider that patients who are due to undergo a blood transfusion have an inviolable right to be informed by those responsible of any possible adverse reactions or health risks. Of course, it goes without saying that the confidentiality of personal data is assured because third parties will not have access to them. I disagree with the European Commission's proposal in Article 9 as it is currently worded. The person responsible for the establishment must be not only a doctor, but one specialised in blood donation, because complications or side effects which require medical care or action often occur during blood donation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention an ethical matter. Under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the human body and its organs cannot be treated as commodities. Consequently, I agree with the principle of voluntary, unpaid donation because I believe that, apart from the ethical implications, this impacts directly on the quality and safety of blood. Finally, it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive will go a long way and is extremely important because of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I will come straight to the point I have difficulty with, and I support completely what colleagues – in particular Mr Bowis – have said. I cannot understand why blood from a remunerated source must necessarily be banned in Europe. Quite frankly, the biggest threat to our hundreds of thousands of patients in the EU who need blood and blood products is the lack of an adequate supply. The supply must be safe but, by definition, a voluntary patient who might have HIV is no safer than a person with no health problems and who is paid. It comes down to the proper screening and treatment of the product regardless of the source. We must not become emotional about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that all blood and blood products came from voluntary, unpaid sources. It is the ethos in my own country, and I would like to encourage it. We must encourage the public to donate blood. There is a scarcity of donations in my own country and many others. We are 50% dependent on imports into the EU. Self-sufficiency has to be a goal. However, to even consider, by definition or otherwise, banning all products that come from remunerated donors is a retrograde step. I am not alone in saying that. The voluntary organisations that look after the interests of patients who need these products are pleading with us in this Parliament and the EU not to ban all sources of paid donations. We must encourage the ethos of voluntary donation, but we cannot ban paid donations. If the patients – not the pharmaceutical or blood companies – are asking us, we should listen to them and respond to them. With the greatest of respect, it would be arrogant on our part not to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been far too many scare stories and accidents across the EU involving blood and blood components. This directive setting standards of quality and safety of collection is absolutely vital. With EU citizens travelling more and more and visiting other EU Member States, we must ensure that when any unfortunate accident happens, whether on holiday or at work, the people are safe in the knowledge about the quality and safety of the transfusion that is going into their bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality and safety are the watchwords, that is why in principle I support voluntary donation. This has been the topic, as we have heard, of a very heated debate and I feel that the rapporteur has given a strong sense of the feeling that voluntary donations are the preferred option in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the United Kingdom there is a special case to be made. Due to the impact of CJD, known as mad cow disease, we have to import our plasma products from outside the Member State. Most of these products come from the United States of America as there are not enough sources in the other Member States and, sadly, the products have to come from paid sources.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a difficult issue but one where the United Kingdom has a particular problem. The United Kingdom Government has been left with no alternative than to take plasma products from paid sources to avoid putting United Kingdom citizens' lives at risk. In conclusion, I welcome this directive and its objectives, I welcome the principle of voluntary donation and I look forward to seeing EU citizens benefiting from the quality and safety of blood and blood components. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of the utmost importance for all EU citizens that the single market in blood and blood products that has been set as an objective cannot work without reliable safety standards. At the same time, however, it must be said that we have managed to reach agreement on how levels of safety can still be substantially increased by making unremunerated blood donation a fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Europe has undertaken some important work to increase safety with regard to blood donations and promote the principle of non-remuneration. This would not prohibit the payment of travel expenses and compensation for lost working time, which is important for donors of plasma in particular, who often have to travel to another area and give up a lot of their time. It is a good principle for the EU too, but if we are just going to be satisfied with making recommendations to Member States regarding practices in the manner of the Council of Europe we shall have lost something essential in our role as legislator. If, on the other hand, we give Member States the right to refuse imports of blood and blood products that have been donated for payment from second and third countries we shall at the same time be weakening the basis of the original aim of the whole directive, the creation of a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation is generally of a high quality and easily manages to control even the small details of human life – too small, one is tempted to say. One cannot help but wonder why this particular directive was unable to distinguish ordinary blood donations from others, such as plasma donations. In the case of the former, we could have introduced an absolute ban on remuneration without any need for exceptions and, regarding the latter, we could have permitted remuneration as long as the shortage of plasma and other special products make it necessary. I shall wait for the Commission to submit a new proposal in which this important detail can be corrected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European public feels that the discrepancies between the Member States’ legislation provide no guarantees of safety given the increasing circulation and import of blood products, on the one hand; on the other, they feel equally unsafe due to the events that have taken place in various countries in recent years. What we are dealing with here, therefore, is not so much the issue of price, of whether or not donations of blood should be remunerated. It is rather a question of whether we can guarantee levels of safety and of not forgetting the importance of the issue of blood for Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Various leaks have taken place recently at the heart of this debate and I am sorry that the issue of whether or not donations of blood should be remunerated has been given centre stage. With regard to this issue, I would say that the rapporteur is right and that we should stick to the common position since, on the one hand, it does not ban remuneration, which is essential in some cases in order to overcome shortages, but, on the other, encourages voluntary donations and even allows some Member States to go further by defining more rigid rules that could even prevent the import of blood products that do not adhere to these rules.

Indeed, some people could even die. Half of all the plasmatic clotting factors currently used in the European Union comes from remunerated donors; either they have made their donation in the EU or their plasma has been imported. It can readily be imagined what a threat it would be to patients if new legislation meant that the supply of these products were to be halved. There is at present no evidence that medicinal products from unpaid donors are in any way safer than those from donors who have been paid. The fact is that the medicinal products authorities in Europe have been checking the safety and effectiveness of all plasma products in the European Union and this has not led them to see the payment of donors as a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else. Contrary to prior expectations, the provision of genetically manufactured Factor 8 – which is only one of the blood clotting factors – has been constantly beset with problems. That precombinant synthetic blood clotting factors would bring with them a boundless range of low-priced compounds, as the pharmaceutical industry originally asserted, has quite simply not, to date, been demonstrated to be true. The products have become more expensive and also hard to obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a cause of dismay that between 400 000 and 500 000 people around the world are dependent on clotting factor compounds; only 10% of them are provided for to the standard of the industrialised countries of the West. Of the world's haemophiliacs, 80% have no supplies. If we now dispense with remuneration, the position of these people – who do not live in the European Union – could get much, much worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want Mr Lund's statement to give a false impression. There is a need for this directive to achieve uniformity across the Member States in matters affecting the safety and quality of blood and blood plasma. Both in terms of infection and the maintenance of supplies, the protection of patients has the highest priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things, therefore, must be safeguarded as a matter of fundamental principle: blood quality and the availability of sufficient blood and blood plasma in the European Union. I will go on record as supporting the Council's Common Position, which enhances the safety of blood and blood components and, at the same time, puts us on course to achieve maximum availability of lifesaving drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Plasma is needed in the manufacture of drugs which are essential to life, for example the clotting agents 7 and 8 for haemophiliacs and immunoglobulins to prevent infections in patients with congenital weaknesses of the immune system. Any bottleneck would put many patients' health at risk, something that we as politicians certainly cannot justify. Voluntary and unpaid blood donation is a basic principle and so let it remain. The payment of expenses to plasma donors in the EU cannot, however, be excluded for the future. Almost 50% of the human blood and blood plasma needed in the European Union has to be imported, mainly from the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive must not prohibit the import of plasma originating from paid donors either. The EMEA study published at the end of last week clearly shows those blood products from paid and unpaid donors are without doubt equally safe. There is therefore no reason to make unpaid donation mandatory on safety grounds, which would inevitably block supplies even of medicinal products manufactured from blood plasma. This makes Amendments Nos 7, 19 and 20 unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, it was in 1628 that Doctor William Harvey first postulated his theory on the true nature of blood circulation. It took about 200 years, however, for this theory to be fully accepted. Thankfully, it has taken a significantly shorter period of time, less than a year and a half, for the Council and Parliament to consider the Commission's proposal presented in January 2001 for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for blood and blood components.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments before you today are the culmination of considerable efforts on the part of the Council in reaching its common position, the Environment Committee in proposing amendments to that position, and the rapporteur, in cooperation with the Spanish Presidency, in trying to reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 28 amendments proposed by Parliament, eight must be rejected by the Commission. These are Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8, 11, 22, 23, 24 and 26. I will briefly give our reasoning on each of these. Amendment No 4, refers to "products", a term that covers, in this context, any therapeutic product derived from blood or plasma, including medicinal products based on blood constituents and prepared industrially. The latter are covered by Directive 2001/83, where technical requirements are specified in detail. As the term "products" in this amendment could lead to legal difficulties, it needs to be omitted.</p>
<p class="contents">This also applies to Amendments Nos 5 and 6 and, to a certain extent, to Amendment No 1, which is acceptable on balance but is somewhat superfluous without Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 7, the Commission accepts the view that the definition of "voluntary non-remunerated donation", as defined by the Council of Europe, should appear in the text of the directive. The discussions in Council, however, have clearly demonstrated that this definition is not sufficiently precise to be included in the enacting terms of a legally binding directive. For these reasons, the Commission prefers this definition to be incorporated in recital 23. We therefore reject Amendment No 7 and accept the compromise proposal put forward by the shadow rapporteur in Amendment No 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8 and 27 propose two slightly different definitions of "haemovigilance". We accept Amendment No 27 and reject Amendment No 8 because Amendment No 27 reflects more closely the directive's provisions on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 11 and 22 propose a preference for the responsible person to be a haematologist.</p>
<p class="contents">As the tasks of the responsible person are managerial as well as technical, such a specialist may not always be required for this post. Furthermore, it is not opportune to mention in a Community legal text specific qualifications that are not harmonised at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States, however, have the freedom to impose stricter requirements if they so wish. I recommend instead voting in favour of the compromise Amendment No 28 by Mr Nisticò. Amendment No 23 has to be rejected because it is not appropriate to modify the title of an article so that it no longer corresponds with its content.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues presented in Amendment No 24 have all been taken into account in the modifications to Article 15 of the common position, together with a new definition of "haemovigilance" presented in Amendment No 27, which the Commission can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 26 has to be rejected. The establishment of any deadline for the introduction of binding requirements relating to voluntary unpaid donations cannot be considered at a time when Member States are facing difficulties in securing an adequate supply of blood – a point made by many of the speakers here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">All other amendments are acceptable to the Commission, either in full or in part. Amendments Nos 1, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19, 25, 27 and 28 are fully acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to elaborate briefly on those amendments that the Commission is prepared to accept in part. These are: Nos 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 21. Amendment No 2, as drafted, clearly is not in line with the limitations of Article 152 of the Treaty. The wording would need to be substantially revised to comply with the Treaty. However, it would be a far better solution to drop the amendment entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 3 and 21, in relation to personal genetic data, the Commission fully supports the idea behind the proposal, but the examples given for potential misuse of data might be too specific. Amendments Nos 5 and 6 would only be acceptable if the word "products" were to be deleted for the reasons I have already given in my comments on Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 would cause major problems. We believe that in Article 4(2), on restrictions of imports among Member States a reference to the Treaty is clearly necessary in order to avoid any misinterpretation of this sensitive text.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording in the compromise Amendment No 20 by the shadow rapporteur provides this reference but the suggestion that voluntary unpaid donations alone can ensure a high level of health protection is scientifically doubtful.</p>
<p class="contents">A revised wording indicating that voluntary unpaid donations can contribute to a high level of public health, as already stated in recital 23, would be acceptable. We are prepared, however, to accept the deletion of the specific reference to Article 30 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally problematic is the proposed reference to Article 19(1), which establishes a Community objective but not a legal requirement. Therefore it cannot, as such, be used to justify trade restrictions among Member States, which are generally only acceptable for very substantial reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger here is that this provision might be vulnerable to legal challenge, which could lead to the directive being annulled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully agrees with the principle of regular reporting by Member States on the issue of voluntary unpaid donations, as proposed in Amendment No 13. However, this reporting requirement should be brought into line with the reports that Member States have to submit every three years on the overall implementation of the directive. I note what Mr Nisticò said in his own contribution on this issue a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 14 can be accepted in a modified form. It would be necessary to make reference in Article 20 to quality management, coupled with a new recital which could include all the extra detailed explanations required by the current amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The cross-reference to Article 11 would provide safeguards for testing to be always carried out in accordance with good practice, while the new recital would provide an explanation for the principles behind the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 16, the Commission is ready to accept the first part, referring to genetic analyses, but not the second part because patents cannot be regulated under Article 152.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea behind Amendment No 18 can be accepted in a slightly modified form within the first paragraph of Article 23.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is the Commission's opinion that, with regard to the 28 amendments, agreement between all three institutions remains within our grasp. The European Parliament is now at a critical juncture where it must make its decision on whether the proposed compromises are acceptable. This decision will either further the debate in the context of the conciliation procedure or enable the directive to go forward for final adoption at the forthcoming Health Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place, after a long university career and coming from a region in the south of Italy, I consider myself to be a man of honour, of the highest intellectual and moral integrity, and I always work for the general good of the patient. Secondly, as a neurologist, my brief diagnosis is that Mr Lund may have suffered temporary minor loss of memory regarding our agreement. I repeat: I agree to include the definition of ‘unpaid voluntary donation’ in recital 23, but I consider, as I said in the meeting attended by the Commission and the Council, that, ultimately, this should be taken into account by the individual Member States. If Mr Lund agrees with me on this point – and I feel the important thing is this – I would leave his proposal totally unchanged but I would conclude with an oral amendment at the end to the effect that ‘this should be taken into account by the single Member States’. I feel that, in this way, Mr Lund, we who have worked together with great enthusiasm and commitment with both your and my group, might resolve an issue which is extremely important to both the donors’ and the patients’ associations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
