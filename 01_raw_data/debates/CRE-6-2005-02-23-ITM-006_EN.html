<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, the European Union played an active part at the sixtieth session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. As in earlier years, it launched the largest number of initiatives: three initiatives on particular topics and ten initiatives on the human rights situation in various countries. The sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights comes in a context that is different in a number of respects.</p>
<p class="contents">At EU level, the recent appointment of a personal representative of the Secretary-General and High Representative for Human Rights underlines the importance the EU attaches to strengthening its human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the United Nations, the publication of the High-Level Panel’s report ‘A more secure world: Our shared responsibility’ triggered a wide-ranging debate on the reform of the UN and of the Commission on Human Rights in particular. While the views expressed on the recommendations relating to the Commission on Human Rights differ, everyone is agreed in stressing the need to give it more teeth and, in general, to strengthen the human rights dimension in the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this new context, the momentum created by the debate on the Commission on Human Rights, together with the hope to which the recent developments in the Middle East have given rise, gives us reason to believe that the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights may make a significant contribution to progress in human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union in fact believes that the Commission on Human Rights is the main United Nations forum for promoting and safeguarding human rights in the world, and it intends to continue to play an active part and to cooperate with other regional groups there. Important as the EU’s activities within the Commission on Human Rights may be, this is nevertheless not the only means at its disposal for promoting human rights. Joint positions on human rights, cooperation with other organisations, such as the Council of Europe or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the human rights dialogues with China and Iran are also ways of promoting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Talks are still going on about the initiatives to be taken by the European Union at the Commission on Human Rights this year. Some decisions have already been taken. The EU will be presenting thematic resolutions on religious intolerance, the death penalty and the rights of the child. These are three essential subjects. In the face of manifestations of intolerance towards believers of any religion whatsoever, the EU intends to reaffirm its determination to combat every kind of intolerance. On the matter of the death penalty, the EU believes that its abolition will contribute to strengthening human dignity and is working for its universal abolition. It considers the Commission on Human Rights to be an appropriate framework for promoting this objective. The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is an important aspect of European Union human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has decided to present resolutions on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Talks on other initiatives to be presented by the EU will continue in the forthcoming meetings of the Working Group on Human Rights, which will be held prior to the session of the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At its March meeting, the Council will formally define the EU’s priorities for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights. Apart from its own initiatives, the EU intends to cooperate with any third countries that may launch initiatives for the promotion of human rights, especially in the fight against terrorism or in the context of transnational corporations. As in the past, it will seek to encourage the spirit of dialogue that is essential for seeking joint solutions to common problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union hopes it can count on the support of Parliament, whose resolution is far more ambitious than our programme for the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights. The Union shares the concerns expressed by Parliament and I can assure you that the issues you have raised will be taken into account in our discussions and in our decisions. However, as I said earlier, we have other tools besides action in the Commission on Human Rights alone and we try to find the most appropriate and most effective tool for each situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that the EU prepares its strategy well and Parliament's resolution and debate serve to stimulate those efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the EU faces a range of challenges, not least the growing hostility of many UNCHR Member States to the very concept of country resolutions, a development thrown into sharp relief by the rejection of the EU's draft resolutions on Chechnya and Zimbabwe at last year's UNCHR. It is my view that such resolutions are a vital aspect of the UNCHR's work, in serving to draw attention to human rights violations and in establishing special rapporteurs who are mandated to investigate and report on such violations.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be expected that, at the very least, the 53 States serving as members of the UNCHR would have seen fit to issue standing invitations to the rapporteurs whose mandates they have helped to create: in fact, only 19 States nominated as UNCHR members in 2005 have done so, eight of which the current EU members. Even where States have issued a standing invitation, special rapporteurs are frequently faced with obstruction and inconvenience in the execution of their mandates.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a concern which deserves greater attention in the framework of the European Union's political dialogue with third countries and in our relations with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is reflecting on the country and thematic initiatives which it will bring at the 61st UNCHR and the European Commission is playing a full role in that process. I would underline that the EU is responsible for the lion's share of country resolutions and it is not realistic to expect it to expand that list indefinitely. We must concentrate our energies on rallying support for our initiatives amongst like-minded countries and the wider membership of the UNCHR in an effort to avert further defeats.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also considering what we can do beyond country initiatives. The key issue here is thematic engagement. I am thinking, for example, of a campaign against the death penalty or religious intolerance, or the issue of child rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise, however, that the likelihood of defeat does not, in itself, constitute an overriding reason to refrain from running a resolution: as human rights defenders constantly attest, the very act of tabling a draft resolution sends a clear signal to the government and people of the country concerned. It is also important that we encourage others to take responsibility for running resolutions on key issues of concern – the lead taken by Switzerland as regards the resolution on Nepal last year is a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's resolution also makes the point that the fact that the EU engages in a human rights dialogue should not preclude support for a UNCHR resolution on a particular country: the co-sponsorship by all 25 EU Member States of Canada's resolution on Iran at last year's UN General Assembly Third Committee demonstrates that this principle is not neglected in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As the EU reaches out to third countries for support for our initiatives, we should also keep firmly in mind the wider context of our relations with many of the UNCHR Member States. I note, for example, that the human rights clause contained in the Cotonou Agreement is not solely concerned with the domestic human rights policies pursued by third countries but extends also to respect for human rights in the context of their international policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also send out a clear message as to our continuing commitment to supporting the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her office as a critical part of the UN human rights machinery. Funding is one part of that and I am pleased to report that a range of projects with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights are in the pipeline this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by underlining the Commission's intention to extend every assistance to the Luxembourg Presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the UNCHR. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cause is fundamental to us, yet we have to be mindful of the public’s consternation at the presence on the Commission on Human Rights of countries that are known as the biggest violators of human rights and that are in fact among the worst dictatorships in the world, such as Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Zimbabwe and China, along with others that have serious human rights problems, such as the Russian Federation, and we all know that this does not apply solely to Chechnya. In light of our European tradition in promoting human rights, we must set out a very clear strategy if we are to work in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, this strategy must be based on three key strands, the first of which is the fight against dictatorships. Human rights culture is rooted in the fight against authoritarianism, totalitarianism and dictatorships, and there must be no let-up in this fight. Unfortunately, over half of the world’s population still does not have the chance to have a Parliament such as this one, and does not enjoy freedom of social or political organisation, and this continues to be a major priority, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Pact on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to draw attention to two new, modern-day threats to human rights. One is terrorism, global terrorism, which we are pleased to see is now addressed from this perspective in Parliament’s resolution. Terrorism is often only addressed from the other side. The fight against terrorism must not violate human rights – we agree on this – but we must also bear in mind that terrorism, by definition and being a very present threat, is one of the biggest causes of fear, one of the biggest causes of insecurity and, in itself, an extremely violent attack on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is a new reality that threatens human rights and that is international crime. The dark side of globalisation – the exploitation of children, child labour, the trafficking of women, organ trafficking, the trafficking of human beings – must also be treated as a new threat to human rights. I feel that it is on these axes that we must focus our attention. We will support the resolution adopted in the Commission, provided some amendments are approved that have split the democratic vote. We reserve the right to a final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intense debate and the amendments tabled concerning the report voted on this week are evidence of the hard work put in by the political groups to achieve a broad consensus.

The PSE Group believes that, whilst respecting multilateralism, the Union’s foreign policy is characterised by measures to ensure the recognition of human rights and their promotion and support. Europe is charged with rooting out suffering in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights get under way, I should like to ask the Commission and the Council to ensure that the European Parliament’s delegation is fully involved in the work and negotiations in Geneva. I must emphasise to the Commission and Council representatives present here today that Parliament is a legitimate and credible body and deserves to be treated as such. Our presence in Geneva must not be purely symbolic. I trust suitable methods of coordination will be set up, to allow us to cooperate in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to call on the Council and the Commission to take full account of the specific content of the recommendations contained in this report. In particular, I should like to draw attention to Parliament’s hope that the Union will adopt a balanced, consistent and demanding stance at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> approach needs to be discarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report goes beyond recommendations addressed solely to countries in the developing world, and focuses on human rights themselves. Consequently, the report argues for abuses and violations of human rights to be denounced wherever they take place, be that in Uzbekistan or in Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, I should like to call on the House to support the introduction of reproductive health rights into this report. I am addressing the more conservative Members in particular. Reproductive health rights are crucial when it comes to combating AIDS and guaranteeing other human rights. We are in favour of combating not only religious discrimination but also discrimination for reasons of gender or sexual orientation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many states and many people around the world, including dissidents and the oppressed, follow this exercise with very great interest. This phenomenon is extremely important to the European Parliament, and so we very much welcome this cooperation between the Commission, the Council and ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the formal aspects of the meeting need to be revised. This could perhaps be done in conjunction with the UN overhaul in September. For example, it is completely absurd that a rogue State such as Libya has chaired the session on human rights. This does not lend any credibility to our work. The meetings also need to be better structured, exactly as my fellow MEP, Mr Ribeiro e Castro said. Despite the good intentions in Geneva, there is of course a great deal of horse trading, with the really big rogue states, such as Iran and China, often being let off the hook, whereas it is easier to agree on North Korea, for example; which is also a rogue State, of course. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe finds this regrettable and would very much like to see resolutions on those very countries – Iran and China – because they are the worst offenders when it comes to the infringement of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very anxious about the situation in Darfur and regret that the abuses and genocide there are not being put before the International Criminal Tribunal. There is a large number of topics and countries that could be discussed, and the excellent report by Mrs Flautre, which has our support, states Parliament’s priorities. I should just like to highlight Chechnya, Zimbabwe and Colombia on behalf of the ALDE Group. It is also very important that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, her staff and various bodies be given sufficient resources to enable them to work on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The three subjects that the EU is to pursue are very good, and have our support. We should also have liked to see one on freedom of speech in relation to journalists. Last year, more journalists than ever were killed on the job, and large numbers of them are in prison around the world. The courage of these people is essential to our learning of human rights abuses, and it is thus a prerequisite for the session in Geneva. For that reason, it is our duty not to forget the work they do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree, but I also remember what Shirin Ebadi said following that sixtieth session. Speaking of the silence on Iran and on the human rights situation in Iran, she said: ‘silence is an insult to the victims’. Those words have stayed with me and I believe we must also remember that at that sixtieth session a number of countries, among them China, Zimbabwe and Cuba, took extremely strong initiatives with a view to stripping the Commission on Human Rights of its substance. The European Union must be particularly vigilant in the face of such extremely damaging strategies on the part of some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear what you say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, about us having several instruments available – I am thinking of China. But why should they be mutually exclusive? For countries such as these, the European Union’s credibility, its effectiveness, lies in showing that it does not have double standards: yes, it has several instruments, but they are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Parliament’s resolution will help to make the European Union’s activity more cohesive and coherent; at any rate, that is what everyone who has spoken in this House wants. We have emphasised a number of rights that are considered new rights, third generation rights. It would be much to the European Union’s credit and advantage to emphasise those rights, which are connected with globalisation. I am thinking of human rights, the rights of man and the responsibility of transnational corporations. The UN is working on these questions; the European Union could encourage and support it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also spent a long time debating the right words for the fight against terrorism, which remains a cause for anxiety in many respects, as Mr Ribeiro pointed out. We would like the States to be given recommendations by the UN on counter-terrorism, because we find there are serious failings in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end very quickly on the question of journalists in war zones. We are talking about a dramatic situation that everyone finds moving. I do not believe the international machinery for protecting such journalists is coherent and effective enough and we ought to give this question some thought, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I nevertheless seem to detect a kind of reverence and a respectful distance – which I also felt during the speeches given by the Commission and the Council – when certain powerful quarters are named, when it is they who are responsible for the failure to uphold human rights. In particular, with reference to Iraq, injustices and violence must be condemned with equal force whatever their origin, whether terrorists or the occupying Anglo-American forces are involved. If prison conditions really were the measure of a society’s level of civilisation, then the West would be in a terrible state in view of situations such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case it is not enough to ask the United States to clarify the situation. Here there is nothing to clarify but we have a political and moral duty to voice a firm condemnation. I also believe that in Afghanistan too, infringements of human rights should be condemned, including when they are carried out by international forces. Moreover, the United States should be called on to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The law must be equal for all and no one must have any kind of international immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently voted to start negotiations with Turkey, and thereby contracted a debt which we must honour: namely, to continue monitoring, day after day, how the situation develops – not just in the legislative field but also in everyday policy – with regard to respect for human rights, in particular those of the Kurdish population, political recognition and a commitment to finding a solution to this conflict, and also recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawal of troops from the northern part of the island. These issues must be explicitly set out in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must also be interpreted in a broader sense: we cannot only condemn violence and the death penalty when individuals are concerned, while overlooking entire political decisions that condemn millions of people to death. I refer to the liberalist economic and financial policies which force, for example, 800 million people to live on less than a dollar a day and deny tens of millions of people access to treatment for AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Amazon, where 20% of the entire planet’s freshwater flows every day, tens of thousands of people in Manaus have no access to drinking water because the service has been privatised. That is an example of how our model of development violates the most important human right, that is, the right to existence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report also includes documents guaranteeing citizens their rights. I am surprised that the priorities do not include the undignified position of women and the failure to guarantee their rights. Our problem is, however, that we sometimes notice failures to observe human rights elsewhere in the world but we do not notice them in our own environs. We assuage our consciences with the fact that we have instruments of justice, by means of which citizens can insist upon their rights. We tend to forget that Lady Justice is sometimes lazy and it takes her a long time to make decisions. Basic human rights include political rights. Political ethics are lacking if we fail to acknowledge such rights for our political rivals. Mr President, I am talking about the undignified position of the non-attached members in this Parliament. We are able to work, thank you, but we are not included in your Hontov system. This seems to be solely for the elite, or is it just one of those documents which subscribes to the principle of winner takes all? Mr President, I was very aggrieved when the President of the European Parliament did not have a seat at the table for the negotiations with President Bush. I was very pleased that the situation was rectified, because it was not just matter of the personal position of Mr Borrell, it was a matter of the position of the President of the European Parliament. I therefore ask that you do not see my contribution as relating to individual people but to our voters, who are entitled to respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am, however, a little cynical when I see references to the UN Human Rights Commission, whose current membership includes Saudi Arabia, which publicly beheads people for drug and alcohol offences; Cuba, which executed three people last year for attempting to flee the country in a hijacked ferry and locks up political dissidents, and Zimbabwe, which is a dictatorship in which press freedom is suppressed and people are subject to arbitrary arrest and torture.</p>
<p class="contents">Ironically, all three countries are cited in the resolution. This is reflected in the 'no action' taken over Zimbabwe and China, where there is extensive use of the death penalty, even for such crimes as corruption, pimping, drug offences and tax fraud, its systematic torture of dissidents and its restrictions on freedom of speech, including the Internet, and religious practice, getting off the hook. China also has a nasty habit of sustaining brutal regimes like Sudan, Burma and North Korea, irrespective of the atrocities they commit, on the basis of non-interference in their internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the UNCHR is the only international vehicle we have for promoting human rights globally, so we must stick with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the bulk of this resolution, in particular the defence of the state's duty to protect its citizens against terrorism and the need to continue dialogue on human rights with countries such as Iran, whose track record is appalling with the recent execution of a 16-year-old girl for sexual misdemeanours. I also take issue with listing India, which is a democracy and subject to the rule of law, being in the same list as China and Zimbabwe. The Indian State actually practices positive discrimination in favour of the lower castes.</p>
<p class="contents">Some recognition must also be given to Uzbekistan and President Karimov's recent undertakings that there have admittedly been excesses in his country in the fight against Islamist terrorists, but he now wishes to free up the press, establish an independent judiciary and abolish the death penalty. These are serious considerations. I feel strongly that we must encourage countries and their leaders who are not totally beyond the pale to move in the right direction and reward them for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to a report on human rights violations in 2004, published on the Internet by the independent Belarussian civil initiative Charter 97, approximately 1 500 people were detained or arrested for political reasons in Belarus last year. Approximately 20 newspapers were closed, and three opposition politicians were sentenced to several years’ imprisonment. The political regime of President Lukashenko exerts control over the media and violates basic human rights, civil rights and political freedoms. The Belarussian people are denied the right to independent information as well as the right of political parties to conduct their affairs freely and the right to freedom of assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">In February of this year, Belarus was also the scene of protests relating to economic issues. Everything indicates that the situation in that country will become more critical as a result of the presidential elections that must take place no later than September 2006. Lukashenko will run for the third time in these elections. It should be remembered that the referendum held last year, which did not comply with any democratic principles, allowed him to hold this position for life. On the other hand, the civilian population in Belarus is rousing itself, above all under the influence of the democratic breakthrough in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am saying this as a representative from Central Europe, and as a former leader of Solidarity, the trade union that began a peaceful revolution in Poland 25 years ago, guided by the idea of human rights. The European Parliament must not resign itself to the creation of a new curtain on the borders of the European Union, this time separating a democratic Europe in which citizens can develop freely from an authoritarian Europe in which political regimes violate basic human rights. We must remember that the flag of the European Union has become a symbol of freedom and hope for a better world in Belarus. We must bear in mind those young people who on St Valentine’s Day distributed light-blue ribbons with gold stars on the streets of cities in Belarus. The heart of Europe now beats in Minsk, and the fate of democracy on the European continent is being decided there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This leads me to make two comments. The first is that we might find it useful, in the context of the interinstitutional dialogue with the presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament, to ask ourselves just how useful the UN Commission on Human Rights really is, and to question the sometimes surprising presidencies it appoints, and the virtual absolution it grants to its members. It may be that the presence of the Union will result, not in blackmail, but rather in a re-examination of the real usefulness of the Commission. I believe that we could use our place within the Commission to attempt to push it towards fairer solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns effectiveness. I note, Mr President, that you proposed that we should actually restrict the number of subjects and countries concerned, and that seems quite sensible to me. The fact is, however, that the resolution tabled by Mrs Flautre is pretty well exhaustive, so that one could take one’s pick. I see it includes the rights of children, religious intolerance and the death penalty. Allow me to add two further subjects which we could include, namely freedom of expression, because it is an essential catalyst in the development of human rights, and slavery in all its forms.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the countries involved – Korea, Burma and Palestine – it seems to me essential to add to the list the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which causes the equivalent of a tsunami every three months, with 3.6 million deaths since 1992 in an atmosphere of general indifference, and finally Darfur, which is really starting to be the ‘forgotten man’ in this context. We could concentrate our efforts on these five subjects and these five countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only hope that the Commission will be guided by strict ethical and objective criteria alone and will no longer be influenced by considerations more akin to cynical <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> than to the defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This was, unfortunately, all too often the case, and it was clear to everyone how the United Nations in general and the UNCHR in particular applied double standards. That was the case during the Cold War and I fear that this is still true of the UNCHR to some extent today.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, for example, during its 60th session, the UN Human Rights Commission rejected the resolutions on Zimbabwe, which the European Union helped to submit, as well as the resolution on China. With regard to those countries, the UN went as far as to adopt what is referred to as a no action motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Could it be that in some cases – I am mainly thinking of China – the concern over human rights on the part of the UN bureaucrats decreases proportionately as the economic interest of the countries in question increases? We hardly dare to imagine, but certainly in the case of China, it is striking how there are those who, time after time, apply double moral standards.</p>
<p class="contents">China is the world leader when it comes to death sentences and executions, yet that does not appear to stop various EU Member States from pushing aside major ethical principles and keeping quiet about human rights when the Chinese leaders come to visit Europe. Of course, major deals are yet to be clinched – Airbus springs to mind – and it is, of course, considered more expedient to keep quiet about that troublesome Dalai Lama or those awkward Taiwanese.</p>
<p class="contents">Those double moral standards are also being applied to Turkey, as speakers from different groups in this House have pointed out on different occasions over the months whenever this became topical. Accession negotiations with Turkey had to begin, by hook or by crook, and despite the persistent reports about countless cases of torture, about taking away the freedom of opinion and assembly, about the state’s policy of denial of the Armenian genocide, about the permanent occupation of Northern Cyprus, it was inconsistent with the truth that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">These are only two examples to illustrate that in this world, <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> still takes precedence over the major democratic and ethical principles to which no more than lip service is being paid. Neither the UN, nor our own EU, are credible disciples or moral philosophers in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For millions of people, the key to a better future, economic development, and to the much-needed improvement in human rights is good governance, and yet there is reluctance on the part of the European Union to confront regimes that are serial abusers of their people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Africa, and this is a continent to which the European Union apparently attaches special importance, a very clear test case of the seriousness of our resolve is Zimbabwe. For years the people of Zimbabwe have suffered under the vicious, bigoted and corrupt Mugabe regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has been consistent, through many resolutions, in its call for robust action against Mugabe and those who keep him in power. I am sorry to say that the Council's reaction has been limp-wristed. At least last week Council renewed its targeted sanctions, but these are not being applied with any real vigour; they are not hurting Mugabe's cronies. With elections in Zimbabwe just five weeks away, simply renewing existing EU sanctions does not send a clear message to the regime that it must change for the better or face the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It was disappointing that the Union failed to take the opportunity to threaten further specific sanctions should violence, oppression and intimidation mar the elections in Zimbabwe. Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling. The opposition MDC has no access to the state-controlled media, its meetings are disrupted and there are over 400 court cases pending against MDC candidates. The voters' rolls are out of date, the opposition has no idea where polling stations will be and to get food, people are forced to attend Mugabe's rallies. No robust international observer mission has been invited and there are arrests of the few remaining international journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">At the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU should sponsor a specific resolution on Zimbabwe and, in any case, use all means at its disposal over the coming vital weeks to ensure free and fair elections in that benighted country.</p>

I consider this to be a worldwide violation of human rights. The Millennium Goals are the concrete objectives to which Heads of Government across the world have committed themselves in a UN context in a bid to improve that situation. Five years after this ambitious plan, we have to conclude that those objectives are a long way from being met. By 2015, all children, and girls in particular, should be attending school. That, in practice, appears to be an empty shell. The right to development is being denied to many. It is now up to the EU finally to deliver on those Millennium Goals in the spirit of putting your money where your mouth is. Most Member States are a long way off the 7% mark of development cooperation. The European Union is still a long way from meeting its pledge to spend 20% of the development budget on basic education and basic health care. When we come to set down the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 – which involve billions – it is these that we should make into the real human rights issues. If those objectives are met, 500 new people can escape from extreme poverty, more than three hundred million people can live without hunger, thirty million children can be saved from premature death, two million fewer mothers will die in child birth, one hundred million more girls and young women will be able to attend school. That is respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, in recent years, it has turned out several times that the show has been run by countries that are known for violating human rights. By concluding strategic alliances, they stand by each other and even manage to give each other pats on the back. It is high time the make-up of the UNCHR, as well as its voting procedures, were subjected to a thorough overhaul. If not, it is at risk of being sunk by its own lack of credibility. The European Union also carries a major responsibility in this. It must work towards more coherence and more consistency in its human rights policy. The EU should finally play a pioneering role, so that the 61st session does not end up being an unnecessary ceremony, but an efficient and credible consultation producing fair, and above all, concrete, results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time as focusing our attention on various details, we should still make very specific mention of the leading violators of human rights, China and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right that Parliament should not be silent on the Chechnya question, for example. Regarding China, I would like to mention a small detail: two words that cause immense suffering. These two words of accusation can destroy the innocent lives of peace-loving citizens. Using the concept of the ‘Evil Cult’ as a pretext, the authorities in China arrest and imprison countless numbers of people. Their only crime is belonging to a religious community. These people are not responsible for civil disorder and do not pose a threat to others. They are simply asserting their basic human rights: in this case the right to assemble and practise a religion. The ‘Evil Cult’ is, as a concept, much too vague to be regarded in any way as reasonable grounds for arrest or imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often stated, our policy on China and Russia is closely tied to factors connected with policy on trade and energy. Sometimes I cannot help wondering what the future will bring in this regard. What will growing dependence on, and the need for, energy, which is already the norm in the EU, mean for European human rights policy? At the moment we are 50% dependent on energy imported from outside the EU, and, according to the Commission’s calculations, that will rise to 70% by 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been mentioned here that expressions of concern by Parliament and in particular the Member States have in certain cases come up against the passivity of the Member States of the Union and the commercial interests operating in the background. If that is what the situation is like now, how far will we go when our dependence increases and we are competing more and more alongside China and India for Russia’s energy resources? Unless we realise this and identify the risk inherent in the situation we are in, the result may be an inadvertent weakening of our human rights policy. It could close mouths when they should be open. We need a pre-emptive strategy which takes our weaknesses and inclinations into account in our desire for a diplomatically comfortable existence.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
