I have the Council’s common position of 9 December 1999 before me. It says in the document passed to us by the Council that this common position was adopted unanimously. If I remember correctly, we were still under the Finnish Council Presidency in December 1999, with a Green Environment Minister. Political Union took place in June 1999, under the German Council Presidency, also with a green Environment Minister. However, I am a little confused because the Greens in this House are maintaining that the common position is so weak that it is imperative that we make a huge number of improvements to it. That is why I wanted to put the question again as to whether we are really voting on the common position that all the Environment Ministers subscribed to, or whether we are mistaken? </p>

The Green Group is not dependent on the positions of the Green ministers represented in the Environment Council.

<p class="contents">But I wanted to speak specifically on the vote on Amendment No 37. I think it is quite logical to vote on Amendment No 11 first, before Amendment No 37, because Amendment No 11 goes further than Amendment No 37. It proposes a total ban on antibiotic-resistant marker genes, which is not the case in Amendment No 37, which relates only to Part C of the directive.

<p class="contents">We have just seen the first vote after the formal sitting fail to secure a qualified majority by only a handful of votes. Does that not demonstrate what we were talking about and the point Mrs Roth-Behrendt has raised? When we have qualified majority votes they should not be interrupted in any way by the formal sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">There were eight votes to go. I can inform you, on the basis of my experience, that you could have completed that in three minutes. It is ridiculous that we are now proceeding with qualified majority votes when Members have not been given a reasonable amount of time to come back into the Chamber.

I would like particularly to underline the point in the motion that Parliament fully endorses the Commission’s statement that the spirit of additionality, as well as the letter of the law, represents a key consideration and is vital to ensuring that programmes have a maximum impact on the ground. In that light it is absolutely unacceptable that the current policy allows Member States, after submission of region-based plans, to reallocate funds internally yet still formally comply with the additionality principle while defying its spirit. This matter urgently calls for review by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the debate – yesterday in fact – I have received a very courteous and helpful letter from Mr Barnier indicating that the Commission is moving our way on this.

However, I believe that parts of this resolution, rather than bringing clarity to the rules, will only serve to confuse the general public and in particular funding operators. Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing. Paragraph G is inaccurate. There is no regulatory requirement to check additionality on an annual basis, but as stated in the regulation, simplification requires three checks on additionality during the programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inappropriate for Members to try with this resolution to rewrite regulations which were agreed unanimously by this Parliament and will be up for review in 2006. More disappointing is the naked party political games which British Members Mr Davies, Mr Bradbourn and Mrs Evans have attempted in this resolution. This will not serve the best interests of our poorest communities, with deliberate misinformation and hijacking this debate for narrow party political advantage. Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions.</p>

I think it is quite disgraceful that the European Parliament bowed to lobbying pressure from the genetic engineering industry on key issues. There has been a massive campaign in recent weeks, but I would have liked Parliament to display the sense of responsibility it gave expression to at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My first point relates to liability. It is quite ludicrous just to call upon the Commission in a recital to put forward an environmental liability directive by the year 2001. We are well aware that the White Paper made no provision for personal liability insurance and that it only related to the Natura 2000 areas. If industry maintains that products of genetic engineering are safe and do not present risks, then I cannot understand why the majority of delegates have caved in and allowed industry to continue to evade responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to antibiotics. A lame demand of this kind takes no account whatsoever of consumer interests. All scientists warn that pathogens in human beings and animals are becoming increasingly resistant, and are calling for an immediate ban on the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes. Parliament has shelved the issue again, and has failed yet again to deal with these major problems. This is most disgraceful!</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the issue of genetic pollution. Simply to ask that the problem be taken account of really is a complete joke, for that is precisely what environmental risk assessment caters for. Parliament originally called for the Member States and the Commission to be placed under an obligation to adopt measures. Parliament has caved in on this too.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I think today has been a black day for consumer protection, and I can only hope that this vote will do industry a disservice. With any luck, consumers will continue to give genetically modified food the thumbs down, for it is unacceptable that industry should be allowed to get away with evading responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have heard on the grapevine that a gene is being discovered which prolongs human life, and I am a little concerned that we may be placing too many restrictions on science and the use of genetically modified organisms. When this gene is discovered, it would be a shame if Parliament decided not to allow the movement of genetically modified organisms, ourselves, in fact, when, at last, we could live longer in better health.

There are major issues at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment. They should be liable for any damage caused by such releases and they should be required to take out liability insurance just as every driver has to take out liability insurance in case he kills or injures another human being. The argument has been made that this issue should instead be covered by horizontal legislation. It is worth noting, however, that we have heard this argument since discussions about Directive 90/220/EEC first started in 1989. At that time, the Commission promised that liability for environmental damage caused by GMOs would be covered by horizontal legislation, but we have been waiting for more than 10 years for that promise to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">We must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes. Many scientists and organisations, such as the Pasteur Institute and the British Medical Association, have called for a ban on the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes, which do not perform any relevant function on the plants and are therefore completely superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">In the common position antibiotic-resistant genes would just “be phased out” in the future, and only if “they may have any adverse effects on human health and the environment”. This would mean that antibiotic-resistant products that have already been authorised would remain. There are many less damaging forms of marker genes available and it is EU policy to prohibit all unnecessary use of antibiotics if there is a risk for human or animal health. The directive should take a clear stand and insist that the use of these marker genes is stopped now.</p>
<p class="contents">The pharmaceutical industry wants a total exemption from the directive. The Environment Committee adopted two contradictory amendments, one for a total exemption and one tightening up the common position line of a conditional exemption with all the normal environmental risk provisions. It is unacceptable that the industry could be allowed on exemption unless the environmental risk provisions apply.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, we have known since first reading that the principle of banning GMOs, or at least having a moratorium to allow for more in-depth studies, was rejected. But the least we could have expected was for Parliament now to decide to take serious steps to protect the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing of the kind has happened, however. The European Parliament has just given way on three vital issues, in circumstances I consider shameful:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">On banning the release of GMOs containing antibiotic-resistant genes</span>: Amendments Nos 11 and 37 which called for such GMOs not to be released into the environment were rejected. Instead we have adopted an amendment that simply calls for particular consideration to be given to this problem in order to identify and phase out by 2005 antibiotic resistance markers in GMOs which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment;</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">On the risk of unintentional gene -transfers to other organisms</span>: Amendment No 12, which called for measures to be taken to prevent such unintentional transfers, was not adopted. Instead, Parliament adopted Amendment No 38, which is much more vague and simply calls for an assessment of the various forms of risk that might be involved in such transfers;</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">On the liability and insurance obligations of persons deliberately releasing GMOs</span>: to our great indignation, Parliament rejected Amendment No 33 which called for persons legally responsible for releasing these GMOs to assume total liability for any damage they caused to human health or the environment and which required them to take out adequate insurance to compensate for possible damage. Instead, it adopted much weaker amendments that express the hope that, in the future, general legislation will be adopted in relation to environmental liability and that call on the Commission to submit a proposal on the impact of biotechnology on all areas over which the European Union has jurisdiction. Alas, as we already know from the White Paper it prepared on the subject, the Commission is not in favour of compulsory insurance in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly disgusted that Amendment No 33 was rejected, for if we want to authorise the marketing of products containing GMOs, we should at least ensure that those who sell them assume liability. The pressure groups in the biotechnology industry explain that there is no risk, while at the same time saying that compulsory insurance is impossible because the risk is not insurable. That tells us something. I have never seen an insurer refuse to insure a non-existent risk.</p>
<p class="contents">One obscure aspect of this business is that the French Government which, according to the most recent information, includes ecologists, had officially expressed reservations about this Amendment No 33. Once again the biotechnology industry pressure groups have done their job at every level, out of sight of the citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject, which has given rise to much debate, is a very topical one, given that yesterday two European regulations entered into force which require manufacturers to label “food and food ingredients” containing more than 1% of GMOs, together with “genetically modified additives and flavourings”, although without setting out any threshold value in this case. As a consumer, I am very pleased about this compulsory labelling because it will allow us to make an informed choice, although I would have preferred stricter rules that required a very clear indication on the outside packaging! Yet this is a positive first step, since it has led several large firms to stop putting GMOs into their products.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the issue under discussion today, this is a proposal to amend Directive 90/220/EEC, which covers both the deliberate release of GMOs for experimental purposes and their deliberate release with a view to putting the products concerned on the market. In the light of the progress of scientific research in this field, it seemed vital to clarify the scope of this legislation in order to give due protection to consumer health as also to the environment. The proposals of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy set out a strict and transparent framework, thus responding fully to consumer concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the three main amendments I support is as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- to prevent any accidental contamination of fields by cross-pollination between GMO and non-GMO crops. To that end, we must require either minimum distances between fields in which GMO crops are grown and those reserved for traditional crops, or that GMO crops are confined to special greenhouses because of the inherent risk of genetic pollution;</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">- </span>to prevent any risk of antibiotic resistance developing as a result of the transfer of the resistant gene from one species to another. So we must ban the release of all GMOs containing an antibiotic-resistant marker gene;</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">- </span>to impose a strict liability system on producers. Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that the person legally responsible for releasing a GMO into the environment must assume full civil liability for any damage to human health or the environment. This principle of responsibility, together with that of GMO traceability and, in particular, the precautionary principle, will enable us to limit the risks as far as possible! Given the uncertainties that remain in this area, we must be as prudent as we can!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by repeating and emphasising that we must listen to what the people of Europe expect of us!

The path may one day prove to have led to something which is the total opposite of all the promises which were given when the journey was begun. I want to issue this warning <span class="italic">today</span>. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs new, tighter regulations in place of the first and still current directives concerning GMOs from 1991. Since 1998, the Commission’s proposals have been under discussion. Further delays would be a mistake. </p>
<p class="contents">As a Swedish Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament, I want to state that it must never be the GMO industry and economic interests which are allowed to govern legislation and regulations. The representatives of these have, on repeated occasions, expressed the view that Europe has “fallen behind” the GMO industry in, above all, the United States and China, that the GMO industry cannot be “developed” as “freely” in Europe and that opportunities for new jobs and businesses “are being lost” in the EU’s fifteen Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Our political decisions must instead be guided by the concept of stewardship and not by manipulation of the genetic code. Our task is to hand the earth and the environment over to future generations in as good a state as possible. We must be able to show that, on the basis of stewardship and the precautionary principle, human beings have a desire to forgo what might appear to be short-term “gains” in favour of higher and significantly more long-term values such as a concern for creation and for genetic diversity. </p>
<p class="contents">In purely practical terms, this means regulations which guarantee a minimised risk of the spread of GMOs, a halt to the use of antibiotic resistance markers, an increase in independent research into the risks presented by GMOs, liability for damages based on the principle that those who release GMOs into the environment with deleterious effects upon health or the environment should be held strictly liable, long-term evaluations of the socio-economic and environmental consequences of the release of GMOs into the environment, permanent labelling of GMO products, compliance with all current regulations, such as the Biosafety Protocol, and an open application and decision-making process in which the public are entitled to express an opinion and in which each application is dealt with separately and no simplified application procedures are approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many uncertainties surrounding the use of genetically modified organisms, and there is good reason for being very careful. On important points, the Council has wished to introduce risk assessment, together with evaluation of the use of genetically modified organisms. The Directive guarantees a high level of protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Where most of the points are concerned, I have been able to agree with the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Where other points are concerned, however, other measures can justifiably be demanded. In the case of genes expressing resistance to antibiotics, the Council’s position makes continued research possible under strict conditions based upon environmental considerations and respect for the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents">Nothing is so enduring as the accidental. I therefore consider it very important to devise general regulations governing liability for environmental damage. Dealing separately with the GMO sector may lead to major differences in the regulations governing liability in different areas. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to investigating the costs, together with the benefit to the public finances, of releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment, I have voted in favour of Amendment No 8 in order to guarantee continued discussion of how such an investigation ought to be carried out.

<p class="contents">Consumers need to have confidence in the food they eat. In this case, the aim is not simply to change our tastes and our traditions in regard to chocolate, but to deal properly at last with the consequences of “mad cow” disease. It is quite astounding that, given the gravity of the situation, today, so many years after the crisis, we still do not have an effective system of traceability in place. We do not propose to repeat the debate we had in December 1999, but the Commission would have been well-advised to scrupulously monitor the application of that regulation; so once again it committed a serious political mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look back for a moment at the embargo on beef. Although one swallow does not make a summer, in this case the French Government gave precedence to reason and caution over the ideology of the single market. Knowing the options that exist in matters European, we can gauge what that must have cost it. The reason why France chose this option is that the Community institutions are not always able, <span class="italic">at this point in time</span>, to ensure real traceability of food products.</p>
<p class="contents">Our consumer information and protection system is totally inadequate: for example, there is no way a citizen of the Union can know whether ravioli imported from another Member State contains any British beef. Should the general public trust a Commission that does not ensure the compulsory traceability of beef yet lifts the embargo?</p>
<p class="contents">I did not find it acceptable for the Commission to teach lessons to France, which, for its part, knows that the impact of the voluntary rules it adopted effectively helped restore consumer confidence. Indeed we also defended that point of view by tabling amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">We note with satisfaction that some of the amendments we tabled in the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment amended important points of the Commission proposal. It is high time we set up a reliable and transparent system. During this vote, we supported the rapid and rigorous application of traceability, with a view to ensuring unfailing traceability and clear and transparent information, and we are satisfied with the results. We hope that today’s vote will not lead to new and shameful calls for an extension or a derogation a few months hence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to social security, I would have preferred it if the decision had, at last, been taken to create a single European pension for the Union. When the European citizens grow old, all the governments abuse them. They are told off for living too long, whereas the real problem is that their contributions have been wasted. The European citizens call upon the Union to set up a single European pension and thus show itself to be more capable, a better administrator and less careless with money than the individual governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, a new wave of neo-liberalism swept through Lisbon and gave the EU its marching orders in the global economic war. Far from focussing on social and democratic rights, indeed looking more to the US social model, the summit once again sang the praises of the law of profit, workforce flexibility and all-out competition, with new forms of privatisation and liberalisation. In short, everything should be quoted on the stock exchange. And this was done with the complicity of all the left-wing governments present in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">To sugar the pill, the EU is promising us quasi-general access to the Internet and cutting-edge vocational training. To crown it all, it is actually dangling the idea of full employment, i.e. the creation of 20 to 30 million new jobs, before our noses. These splendid promises mean only one thing: a huge rise in insecure jobs, casual work and low wages, with the constant threat of redundancy and, on top of that, a scheme for an inegalitarian overhaul of the social protection system. Employers, for their part, will once again enjoy quite indecent subsidies. A new economy, but we are being served up the same old recipes again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some saw this as the ‘Employment Summit’, others as the ‘Summit for the Society of Innovation and Knowledge’. In the end, it turned out to be the ‘Internet Summit’, as it was in this area that some of the most promising promises were made, if you will forgive the repetition of terms. If only these promises could be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">We share these expectations but we should also like to be able to congratulate the practical results achieved. On this score, only the future will tell. Yet we already regret certain weaknesses. Furthermore, the mainly socialist European leaders who met at this summit could not resist the bewitching rhetoric of promising results for which they are not really responsible, yet did not make any promises on the issue which is their responsibility, namely the actual means to achieve these results. We should also like to have seen more practical emphasis on two basic points. These are the reduction in tax and the obligation to pay employment contributions and the effective deregulation and removal of red tape, thereby stimulating entrepreneurial initiative and promoting growth. The desire to defend the ‘European social model’ is admirable. Yet this defence cannot be achieved at the expense of economic dynamism and, ultimately, the very future and quality of this social model. These thoughts are reflected in our votes and the amendments tabled.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Masquerading with the greatest cynicism under the grandiose title of ‘modernising the European social model by investing in people’, are the demands of big business for greater profitability as a means of ‘supporting employment’. The competitiveness of enterprises is being increased by cutting labour costs, the labour market is being fully liberalised and made more flexible, atypical forms of employment are being promoted, social security systems are under review and any remnant of the welfare state is being provocatively squeezed. That is not ‘investing in people’ as the Summit meeting would have it. That is the estrangement of people to the benefit of the market, the subjugation of working people to the demands and criteria of monetary credit, and the subjugation of the social state to the indexes and criteria of nominal convergence and EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Lisbon economic and social policy guidelines are promoting, what is in practice being prepared for working people and ‘served up’ under a misnamed ‘modernisation’ – intended to ‘sugar the pill’, deceive working people and reduce public reaction against the anti-labour and anti-grass roots economic and social policy of the EU – is a minimum level of poverty and not a minimum level of prosperity. The ‘New Economy’ is actively preparing the creation of an extensive stratum of ‘employed poor’, with miserly wages, restricted security and welfare rights, who will be obliged to change jobs according to the dictates of the unaccountable market and the laws of the lawless interests of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU does not seem interested in fighting unemployment and promoting and supporting stable and full employment. On the contrary, it is preparing working people, and this indeed at a fast rate, to live in a situation of complete and permanent insecurity. Besides, the Presidency’s conclusions boldly state that the aim is ‘improved employability’ and both the information society and education are dragged along in chains to serve that rationale as tools to support part-time work, tele-employment and piecework employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Prosperity is destined for big business, to which splendid fields of glory are being opened since, in order to satisfy its demand for a ‘fully operational internal market’ and greater competitiveness against the USA, the pressures of international competition are being fully transferred to the labour market, liberalisation is being speeded up and the so-termed ‘structural changes’ (privatisations, market liberalisation) in vital sectors such as energy, telecommunications, postal services, transport, water supply and others are being promoted. Instead of being controlled, restructuring, mergers and company relocations leading to tens of thousands of job losses are being made even easier. Public and social investments are dwindling, equal opportunity and the fight against all forms of discrimination related to access to employment, and labour relations are being undermined, and priority is being given to whatever serves the aim of the ‘economic productivity of labour’ for big business, in other words low wages, lack of social protection, flexible and temporary employment, and the persistent exclusion of women, young people and people with special needs from the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The more than 60 million people who are victims of long-term unemployment, mass poverty and social exclusion, and all the working people in Europe too, cannot react ‘adaptively’, ‘supportively’, ‘obediently’ or ‘cooperatively’ to such choices. You will find them in front of you, unsubdued, uncompromising and unyielding, fighting for and demanding full and steady employment and a system of social policy that includes insurance, health, pensions, protection for the unemployed, real equality of opportunity, quality education and substantive professional training.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing in the Lisbon conclusions one could agree with is that ‘people are Europe’s main asset’, except for the fact that they are not disposed to be ‘liquidated’ in the international money markets and to sacrifice themselves so that the monopolies can inflate their profits. That asset is, and will prove to be, valuable in the struggle for a social, democratic and supportive Europe, a Europe of peace, progress and socialism.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was because the respective conclusions do not contain any significant reference to the issue of protecting human rights in Africa or to the development of independent legal systems. The second reason was specifically because there is no mention in the text of last week’s events in Angola which involved yet another brutal attack on the freedom of expression and freedom of the press, values which are so dear to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Two journalists and human rights activists – Rafael Marques and Aguiar dos Santos – were sentenced by a court in Luanda to imprisonment and fines for simply having criticised, in a press article, the Angolan President, José Eduardo dos Santos. As defendants, their rights to a defence, which are fundamental in any rule of law, were violated, particularly by the absence during the trial of Rafael Marques’ lawyer and by them not being permitted to prove the veracity of the facts as the judge argued that the case concerned the figure of the President of the Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community and the political leaders of Europe must react against this climate of intolerance and constant disregard for human rights in Angola. On this first occasion for the discussion of EU-Africa relations in this House, I must therefore once again strongly protest about this attack on the freedom of expression by the Angolan authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, having taken advantage of this opportunity to highlight these events, I must remind you that this Parliament recently approved a resolution on freedom of expression and press freedom in Angola which condemned the abuses occurring in that country. I therefore ask the Council and its presidency, and also our President, to use all the means at their disposal to put pressure on the Angolan authorities to re-establish the rule of law, freedom and peace in Angola. This is the only way to end the suffering of a people who are as entitled as anyone to human dignity and happiness.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact the only purpose of the famous equal partnership is to remind the Africans that they are indebted to international law and must bow to the panoply of neo-liberal instruments.</p>
