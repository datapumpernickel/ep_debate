<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, former fellow MEPs, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, the World Food Summit – Five Years On was held in Rome from 10 – 13 June 2002. The purpose of the meeting was to strengthen international support for reinforced efforts to combat hunger and poverty with a view to achieving the aim of halving the number of the world’s starving by the year 2015. This aim was confirmed in connection with the UN’s Millennium Summit in September 2000 and now forms a basic element of the international development aims to which the global community has committed itself. The EU places great emphasis on these aims from the Millennium Summit as a starting point for national and international strategies to combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the World Food Summit in 1996, the number of starving people in the world has fallen, but unfortunately by nowhere near the extent necessary. The average fall in the number of the starving today is just six million, despite the fact that there is a need for renewed and strengthened efforts if we are to achieve the annual average fall of 22 million in the number of starving people that is required for us to achieve our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit resulted in a declaration entitled ‘The International Alliance against Hunger’, which was able to be passed as early as on the first day of the summit. Under this heading, the international community commits itself to strengthening and coordinating its efforts to combat hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">During the preparations, the EU worked in particular to ensure that the declaration maintained the obligations established at the World Food Summit in 1996 and did not water down the agreements reached previously. At the same time, the EU sought to ensure that the results of the most important international conferences and summits of recent times – including, especially, the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 and the International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey in March 2002 – were taken further and that links were made with the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, where the issue of combating hunger and poverty will be dealt with as an integral part of the overall international development policy agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Barcelona, the EU emphasised two parallel responsibilities: firstly, the developing countries’ primary responsibility for their own development and for the implementation of the action plan agreed at the World Food Summit in 1996 and, secondly, the international community’s responsibility to assist the poorest countries in this process. It was also crucial for the EU to secure recognition of the fact that efforts to combat poverty and hunger should take place within the frameworks of the developing countries’ own priorities and strategies for combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures to encourage production are essential, but are not alone the solution to the problems. The level of global food production today is already sufficient to feed everyone. In a number of developing countries, the particular problem is that of securing the distribution of, and access to, food. Hunger is a problem relating to poverty. Consequently, broadly-based poverty-oriented economic growth and an improved economic distribution policy that benefits the poorest population groups are crucial for a sustainable solution to the world’s problems involving hunger. Efforts to combat hunger must therefore also include objectives for, among other things, good governance, respect for human rights, land reforms and an increased focus on health, education and production-oriented research and communication. In addition, consideration has to be given to the sustainable utilisation of natural resources and to the importance of ensuring conflict prevention. Finally, the developing countries’ access to research and technology is an essential element in the fight against hunger and poverty. All these elements were emphasised by the European Union in the run-up to the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the international sphere, the EU considered it important to emphasise the necessity of increasing total aid to the level of the internationally approved objective, which is to spend 0.7% of GDP on development aid. In this connection, it also wished for confirmation of the commitments made at Monterrey in March.</p>
<p class="contents">The poor countries’ access to the markets in the West is naturally an essential element in efforts to promote those countries’ development. The EU has already shown the way with the launch of the “Everything but Arms” initiative which, as we all know, means that the EU is giving the less developed countries duty- and quota-free access to the European market for all products with the exception of arms, or almost all products with the exception of arms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the negotiations, the EU also emphasised the importance of safe food for consumers in every country. At the same time, we stressed the need to provide technical support that enables the developing countries to meet internationally recognised food standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For the EU, it was important that the discussion of trade and development did not prejudice the WTO negotiations and the follow-up of the Doha development agenda. In its conclusions of 30 May 2002 concerning preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development the Council confirmed that the EU is firmly resolved that the Doha development agenda should be implemented, with a positive result and within the specified timescale. The EU considers it important to achieve sustainable results on all fronts, which includes substantially greater opportunities for market access, including for the developing countries. This is to be based on balanced rules and targeted, sustainably-funded technical assistance and programmes designed to build up capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit declaration largely reflects the EU’s priorities and attitude, which I have just outlined. The declaration focuses on consolidating the results of the 1996 World Food Summit and the recent international conferences, as well as on a strengthened and renewed political will to make active efforts to achieve the international development aims in respect of combating hunger and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration launches a new initiative on the right to food. Thus agreement was reached that an intergovernmental working party was to be set up to devise voluntary guidelines on the right to food, with the assistance of the FAO and involving all other relevant UN bodies with competence in the area of human rights. The developing countries hope that such guidelines will give added weight both to the requirement to secure the poor countries’ access to food and, thus, to the combating of hunger. The EU is backing the initiative and will be actively involved in the work on making the right to food a practical tool.</p>
<p class="contents">In the circumstances, we can be satisfied with the overall outcome of the summit. The outcome paves the way for the further discussions we will have in connection with the world summit in Johannesburg in August, where we will tackle the broad development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The balanced result is due not least to active input into the negotiations on the part of the EU. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the outgoing presidency of the Council for its efforts. The then President-in-Office, Prime Minister Aznar, represented the EU at the Summit. In his contribution on behalf of the EU, he emphasised the Union’s strong support for reinforced efforts to combat hunger and reported in detail on the EU’s attitude to the topics of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this input, the EU managed to create a constructive climate for negotiations and effective cooperation with the developing countries, with which we reached agreement on a wide number of matters, as is now reflected in the declaration. At the same time, the EU was closely involved in the latest crucial negotiations concerning the most controversial issues. Overall, the EU thus played a not insignificant role with regard to securing progress in the negotiations and a sensible result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by emphasising that the EU is already making substantial efforts to contribute to combating hunger and poverty, both via the EU’s Community aid and through the EU Member States’ own bilateral and multilateral aid programmes. The EU and the Member States provide over 50% of total global development aid, a large part of which is spent on the development of rural areas and on the agricultural sector in the poorest countries. The EU and the Member States have already committed themselves to a substantial increase in their development aid at the European Council meeting in Barcelona in March of this year. A number of Member States, including my own country, Denmark, have already far exceeded the international objective of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid. All the countries have undertaken to continue contributing the target 0.7%, or more if they are already contributing at a higher level. Those Member States that have yet to achieve this target have undertaken, as a minimum, to increase their development aid to the current EU average of 0.33% of GDP so that an overall EU average of 0.39% can be achieved by 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the basis both of these efforts and of binding partnerships with the developing countries that – under the Danish Presidency too, and especially in Johannesburg – the EU will go on working to step up the international fight against hunger and poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – For the Commission and the European Union the summit provided an opportunity to renew the dialogue with developing countries concerning the implementation of the Rome Plan of Action and to confirm our political will to fight against hunger and malnutrition. The outcome of the summit was the adoption of a declaration containing many good elements that I hope will support and contribute to the promotion of coordinated action in order to achieve the 1996 summit target.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, the summit decided to set up an intergovernmental working group with the participation of all stakeholders in order to elaborate, within a period of two years, a set of voluntary guidelines on the right to adequate food. The objective of the guidelines is to support the efforts of the member states of FAO to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security. Time will tell what the impact of this decision will be. We are certainly willing to be part of that effort and to make sure that it is going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of such a declaration supported by the whole FAO membership has certainly raised the profile of the fight against hunger on the international agenda. The Commission welcomes this positive achievement and is happy to see that the declaration reflects the views of the EU on many issues.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in our opinion the declaration misses a key strategic line, one that has been consistently supported by the EU: the importance of elements other than agricultural production and productivity in addressing food insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the issues I will mention here be addressed simultaneously and in the framework of national poverty reduction strategies. These essential elements are: food availability, production, strategic reserves and trade in food; access to food – for example economic growth, employment, income, to make this access realistic; response to crisis situations, such as safety nets; and nutritional problems, which, in the long term, constitute the main element in all this.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the summit failed to clearly denounce and clarify the most crucial overriding causes of hunger, which are bad governance and man-made disasters. Some estimates say that about 80% of the people suffering from hunger are victims of conflicts – man-made problems. There are different versions of this. Zimbabwe is one such case. The problems in Zimbabwe are, to a great extent, man-made. There is also a very real drought in southern Africa. Of course we will provide humanitarian aid, but it should be kept in mind that a lot of this is man-made.</p>
<p class="contents">The FAO’s public statements and appeals during the preparation process and the summit itself have been placing too much emphasis on additional ODA resources and on the role of agriculture and rural development. The issue of ODA has already been reasonably successfully treated in the Monterrey Conference, and the EU remains committed both to the Monterrey Consensus and the clear commitments on increased ODA that were decided in Barcelona and presented in Monterrey, and which the Danish Minister has just gone through in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">In Rome, it would have been more appropriate to re-emphasise one of the main themes of recent summits and conferences: the crucial need for developing countries to overhaul their national development and sectoral policies in order to take due account of the needs and constraints of the rural poor and food insecurity. This should lead to the formulation of national poverty-reduction strategies, including food security concerns, focusing on agriculture and rural development as appropriate. It would then be the role of the donor community to support the implementation of national policies and strategies in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament contributed to the international debate through the adoption on 16 May 2002 of the resolution on the summit. The Commission agrees with the thrust of this resolution, which contains many important elements, such as support for the Monterrey Consensus and the emphasis on the need for increased policy coherence in developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s reminder that food aid must be reserved for emergencies and must be granted solely in the form of donations, with supplies being purchased whenever possible locally or within the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission does not endorse all the elements contained in that resolution, and in particular not the call made on the Commission itself and on EU Member States to contribute to the FAO Trust Fund established last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I do regret that the same calls for contributions to that fund are contained in some of the motions presented to this part-session of Parliament. The opinion of the Commission remains the same as it was on the occasion of the last debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC policy is to directly support national and regional development processes and programmes in the context of its regional partnership agreements. I am also firmly convinced that the multiplication of funding instruments, such as separate trust funds, etc., will not lead to the generation of additional financial flows but will only add to the diversion of funds. The Commission also agrees with the longstanding policy of the European Union that the FAO should concentrate its resources where it has the best capabilities and added value, and that is in its normative work. The orientation of the possible actions under the Trust Fund appears to be outside of that area. I would, therefore, not want the Commission to encourage this.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the FAO’s food security approach is very much production-driven and does not promote the broader concept of food security. We are, however, cooperating financially with the FAO on specific projects and programmes and will continue to do so, whenever we can see competence, added value and professional excellence that match the priorities and objectives of the Community’s development policy. The Commission therefore does not consider contributing to the FAO Special Programme for Food Security and to the Trust Fund as a priority in its development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add here that Parliament's resolution of 16 May 2002 was adopted, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, following the debate on the statement made by the Commission without any prior consultation with the Commission. So I have made quite specific reference to the new drafts in my speech here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the key role of rural development and agriculture in fighting poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation, the Commission will present, before the end of the year, a communication to the Council and Parliament on “Fighting Rural Poverty – An EC policy and approach to rural development and sustainable natural resources management in developing countries”.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing I would like to recall that this World Food Summit is a step in a long process, which started in Doha and Monterrey and which will end in less than two months in Johannesburg. It is my conviction that each of the major conferences that have taken place since Doha are not a response on their own to the global governance gap that we are facing. Only the totality of these different conferences give a meaningful response to the challenges of sustainable development and it is this totality that defines what we like to call the global deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, today is my mother's 97th birthday and in her lifetime she has seen wars and famines, poverty and plagues, and she has also seen our world find the knowledge to prevent and defeat these global ills. But she has not yet lived to see the leaders of our world unite, to use that knowledge to bring peace and health and the means to live for the 800 million of our fellow human beings who are hungry.</p>
<p class="contents">She was 69 when the first World Food Conference pledged everyone must be free from hunger – not everyone except 400 million – everyone. She was 91 when the World Food Summit abandoned that pledge and set a target of halving the world's hungry to 400 million by 2015. Now we know that this appallingly modest target will not even be met until 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second half of my mother's life, 400 million people have died of hunger – three times the numbers killed in wars in her lifetime. On this her birthday another 24,000 will die. Surely we could have expected that the Rome Summit would have agreed an action plan to stop this slaughter. Surely the leaders of the western world would have supported a programme to address the causes of hunger: poverty, conflict, disease, sanitation, bad governance, man-made disasters, and inadequate local food production and distribution, the very points that you, Commissioner, raised in your letter of 20 June to Mr Diouf on the failings of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">You were right, but you were excessively polite. You might have started by condemning the EU Member States, of whom only Italy the host, and Spain the presidency, sent heads of government. The British Labour Government did not even send Mr Blair, did not send the passionate Clare Short. No, they sent a junior official, a member of the DFID's – quote – "knowledge-sharing on special initiatives unit". That is how much they cared. Where was the passion? The Italian press made it clear that the delegates were more interested in the <span class="italic">dolce vita </span>than in fighting world hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit took two and a half years to put together. It cost millions. It was so well organised that the final document was agreed before the summit began. And what a declaration! It recalls, recognises, reaffirms, reiterates and then goes on to do it all again. The new policy to help the hungry of the world is not "Everything but Arms", but anything but lift your arms to do anything. One recommendation sums it up – and the Commissioner quoted it: "We invite the FAO to establish an intergovernmental working group to elaborate in a period of two years a set of voluntary guidelines for Member States to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food". What a message of hope for the hungry. What a cop-out. Think nothing, see nothing, do nothing. No new thoughts, no new vision, no new initiatives and no urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2015, and no doubt in 2030 too, we will be back regretting lack of progress, extending deadlines, reducing targets, setting up working parties and failing to help the hungry nations to solve their needs. Again we will issue emergency appeals for the consequences of our inaction today.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we move to Johannesburg and our message must be: "Wake up Europe, wake up the Western World". For once overcome this political sleeping sickness that seems to paralyse us in the face of disasters that together we have the power to prevent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the fact is that the number of hungry people has remained the same over the past five years. It is very unfortunate that so few of our European leaders attended the ‘World Food Summit: five years later’ in Rome three weeks ago. It once again illustrates that only a few seem to want to narrow the gap between rich and poor in this world by way of priority, let alone meet basic needs, such as food and basic health care. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Mr Prodi and Commissioner Nielsen <span class="italic">were</span> present in Rome proves that Europe can take the lead, and would also be prepared to do so if it were up to the Commission. However, a few changes will have to be made in that case. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the head of the World Food Programme, Mr James Morris, 300 million malnourished children in the world can be fed at school for EUR 0.24 per child per day. At the moment, we spend in Europe EUR 2 daily per cow on subsidies. The chasm between rich and poor is not narrowed by means of extra funding or food aid to developing countries, but precisely by means of additional policy. We must take the subsidised cow by the horns. Without adequate reforms to the common agricultural policy now, the objectives of the World Food Summit will never be reached, and certainly not by 2015. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Commissioner Nielsen was right to state that, as an organisation, the FAO remains very inefficient. Commissioner Nielsen is right to demand only concrete, national, regional support and no general FAO fund contribution, and he was right to criticise the bad management, such as in Zimbabwe. By adequate agricultural policy, I specifically mean the shift of production subsidies towards rural development, but mainly also free and fair trade. We should call an end to the dumping of European products in developing countries. We should in Europe abandon the export subsidies for our own farmers and we must lower the trade barriers for developing countries to a minimum. </p>
<p class="contents">I await with bated breath the EU’s new agricultural policy, on which the Commission will be taking a decision next week. As Commissioner Nielsen rightly said, that is where, in addition to national policy in the developing countries themselves, a large proportion of the solution to world hunger lies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because leaders everywhere leave a great deal to be desired. In principle, there is food for everyone. There is no shortage of objectives and good intentions. The fewer results are yielded, the more summit meetings are organised which do nothing but conclude that policy must be intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is to blame, the rich countries or the poor ones? Both, Mr President. The developed states are hypocritical. Despite fine declarations of intent, they carry on over-subsidising their own agriculture and protecting their own market. The liberalisation of the world market is not obstructed by Europe alone, but also by America and other large agricultural states. Western companies continue to exploit their patent monopolies on techniques and crops, development cooperation focuses too little on agriculture and technological expertise is not passed on.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries also leave a great deal to be desired. Although most people live in rural areas, too little attention is given to food production. Famines can really not only be ascribed to the climate or high toll barriers; endless wars, treating nature in an irresponsible manner, extreme population growth, over-urbanisation, inadequate infrastructure, but also corruption and mismanagement, in particular, stand in the way of sound agriculture. Products are imported in order to feed cities bursting at the seams; there is too little regional trade and a great deal of monoculture. Military expenditure for rulers is at the expense of affordable food for the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Solemn statements and reiterations of earlier conclusions are not expressions of real political will, but rather attempts at concealing its absence.

As in Monterrey, the World Food Summit has now also roundly failed to realise the auspicious objectives that its initial agenda led us to expect. This FAO Summit has nevertheless confirmed, however, what we have repeatedly asserted: the objectives of the fight against hunger and malnutrition set in 1996 are far from being achieved and perhaps increasingly so. This is the current state of affairs, despite the fact that the right to healthy and sufficient food is a fundamental right of all human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation has arisen because there is no objective programme, because there are inadequate resources and because no appropriate guidelines or measures are in place, specifically with regard to access to land and water and ideally underpinned by a concept of sustainable development, of which the right to food sovereignty and support for family- and community-based agriculture must be essential elements. This situation has arisen because there is no appropriate policy for wealth distribution and because what is lacking, above all, is political will, clearly demonstrated by the low number of Heads of State and Government of developed countries present in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also happening, however, because at the same time there are too many negative factors preventing the current tragic situation from being turned around, such as the utmost priority that is given to trade issues and ultraliberal policies, subsidies given by rich countries to their goods exports in the primary sector, which have clearly influenced the recent decisions taken by the US in this field, or even the preposterous way in which biotechnologies are now being promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now only hope, even though we do not have huge grounds for remaining optimistic, that in Johannesburg, a new, more promising phase will be launched. Once again we reaffirm the need for the European Union to play a major role in defending the right of the poorest countries to protect their fish stocks and to develop their rural economies in the aim of guaranteeing their food sovereignty in the context of a much-desired sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The absence of thirteen European Heads of State from the Summit and the Italian Prime Minister’s request that the end of the meeting be brought forward because of a football match graphically illustrate how little interest famine in the world generates in our countries. One international conference takes place after another – Monterrey, Rome, Johannesburg; Europe would have the world believe that development is its chief concern. At the same time, however, it abolishes the European Union Development Council, and the Directorate-General for Development may also be axed soon. And we abstain from any binding involvement or commitment whatsoever on behalf of the poorest populations.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the other huge disappointment at the Summit, where we confined ourselves to subscribing to commitments that had previously been undertaken without any means of obtaining the tangible resources required for their fulfilment. This, incidentally, had happened in Monterrey too, but it was even worse in Rome. Mr Berlusconi even had the effrontery to cast doubt on the duty of the industrialised countries to assist the developing countries in their desperate plight, invoking the precept that ‘God helps those who help themselves’. Likewise, the WTO helps the United States and the European Union to maintain and even increase their export subsidies on farm produce, subsidies which fly in the face of the sacrosanct principle of free trade proclaimed by those same two parties and which are used to a great extent to the detriment of the poor countries that are the main exporters of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">How can anyone attach any credit to a US Administration that has just increased its subsidies to cotton farmers or to the governments of the EU Member States that refused to commit themselves in Doha to a timetable for the reduction of their subsidies on agricultural exports? We are disappointed by the resolution that the European Parliament has proposed, because it fails to condemn the gulf between the words of our governments and their deeds. The Roman Emperors used to have a formula for appeasing their poorest citizens: bread and circuses. I believe there were certainly circuses this time in Rome, but the bread was forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every human being has the right to have access to healthy and nutritional food and a fundamental right to be protected from famine. Hunger and malnutrition are not due to the fact that there is simply not enough food in the world. There are currently an estimated 815 million people suffering from hunger.

This is largely the same number as when the first food summit was held in 1996, so let us tell it how it is: the efforts to combat hunger in the world have failed. In this context it is disgraceful to see – as commented on by many Members – the apathy exhibited by the Western Heads of State in their absence from the latest Food Summit in Rome last month.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of hunger in the world are largely due to hypocritical policy implemented by the EU and others. The policy, which is officially supposed to be there for the poorest people in the world, is to far too great an extent controlled by the EU’s own narrow foreign and trade policy interests. Officially, the EU and the other Western organisations advocate free trade and liberalisation as the solution to all the world’s problems. However, in reality the liberalisation applies only to the developing countries, where the requirement of liberalisation completely destroys their ability to build up independent sustainable production. Earlier this year Oxfam issued a report that concluded that the EU is the world’s most protectionist market towards the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time that we put our own house in order and grasped the nettle. There is a great deal of work ahead of us if our wish to eradicate hunger is to succeed. As a minimum, to start with we could abolish the EU’s protectionist agricultural subsidy schemes, suspend our fisheries agreements with third countries – which are designed to deprive the very poorest in the world of their living, establish a development policy that is genuinely aimed at combating poverty and not governed by the fight against immigration and terrorism as well as concerns about our own jobs and, last but not least, support the poor countries’ right to their own production and access to water, soil and biological diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, five years on from the first summit in 1996, we have to acknowledge that we have clearly failed in our aim of halving this figure by 2015. It is imperative that this discrepancy between promises and reality is overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to combat this tragedy is also reinforced by the thought that hunger is both a cause and an effect of poverty. A starving man is not a free man: he is a desperate man and can easily be persuaded to take part in desperate actions such as conflicts, international crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal immigration and terrorism. There is no doubt that the western world needs to pay much greater attention to this, and the commitment by the industrialised countries to donate 0.7% of their gross domestic product is more relevant now than ever. It was John F. Kennedy who said that no one can be considered rich if their neighbours are poor. That is why we need practical action and projects. We have to act immediately to prevent a further 2 billion people joining the 4 billion who are currently cut off from wealth, as the demographic studies forecast.</p>
<p class="contents">Good governance in these developing countries is, however, an essential prerequisite if the cooperation which is vital for the achievement of the objectives we have set is to be strengthened. Access to information, as the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has proposed, rather than failure to deliver on undertakings, as Mr Rod has observed, and the new model of digital state organisation to combat corruption and increase efficiency would certainly make any use of development aid more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter that urgently needs addressing through a conference of FAO countries is that of the proper operation of the agency itself. The way it works and is managed needs to be reformed and rationalised in order to improve its transparency and efficiency and to achieve more suitable actions and results. At Johannesburg, I will have the opportunity, together with the delegation from the European Parliament, to see whether the European Union will really be able to give – and make others give – tangible political commitments with precise deadlines, the achievement of which will have to be based on effective partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was Monterrey, on development funding, with mediocre results, and the second was Rome, on food, which yielded no real results. The final opportunity is this Johannesburg meeting, on sustainable development, which, as well as achieving commitments on this issue, must translate into concrete measures what was done at the previous ones and, as the Commissioner has said, from a global point of view. There are therefore great hopes in this summit and above all the European Union has an enormous responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">To the failure of Rome we must add the revision of the objectives agreed in 1996, on halving world hunger by 2015. It has already been acknowledged that this objective is not going to be achieved since there is not the sufficient political will to make the necessary efforts. I hope that we will achieve some improvements during this Danish Presidency, given the sensitivity it has.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford more failures, above all the developing world, and this is a question of survival. We cannot hold summit after summit without results. We must therefore make very practical and realistic proposals which we want to communicate to the Commission and the Council: a code of conduct to guarantee food, based on the belief that food is a fundamental human right, and an emergency plan to deal with the famines and food shortages currently affecting 14 million people in Africa. These are practical measures in relation to which the Council and the Commission must achieve a worldwide commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rest of the measures highlighted in the resolution, in particular the considerations of the Community budget and the EDF, greater coordination between bilateral and multilateral donors, the importance of microcredits and of the creation of an alliance against hunger and poverty. The fact that the Union and its Member States are the main donors of aid allows the European Union’s representatives to take the lead in making this summit a success, a success which is not merely something which this Parliament wants to see, but which is a commitment of the European Heads of State and Government in accordance with the conclusions of the Seville European Council. We fervently hope that the Union’s representatives will return from Johannesburg with concrete commitments and action plans and we will ask them to give us an account of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to hear that the Commissioner is going to present us with a very specific communication on an action plan to combat poverty. We anxiously await that communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is this hard fact not enough to justify a radical rethink of the policies that are currently being pursued? The subsidies that the governments of industrialised countries pay to their own farmers are forty-eight times higher than the amount paid to support agriculture in poor countries. Direct competition between agricultural products from countries with very unequal productive systems, as well as the practices of exporting countries in the developed world, coupled with the risk of dependence facing the countries of the South if they specialise in the export of one or two primary products – these are the long-term threats to the future food security of the people who inhabit three quarters of our planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of these practices, which are totally consistent with the enshrined provisions of the WTO Agreements, are verifiable and have been verified. These practices kill. The Johannesburg summit could be an opportunity to make other choices, to focus on other avenues as yet unexplored, such as guaranteeing the right of developing countries to protect their rural economies with a view to defending their food security against multinational corporations and to supporting local food-processing businesses. Why not make hard and fast provisions for the creation of a specific fund designed to guarantee the effective achievement of all these objectives? The Director-General of the FAO has estimated that an additional amount of 24 billion dollars would be needed to achieve the aforementioned aims. The disaffection of the Heads of State at the FAO summit, however, provided confirmation that the developed countries’ would not be committing any more resources, which cannot fail to give cause for concern. The only effective remedy would be a response to the needs of the poor countries; at the Forum of the Peoples that has just been held in Sibi, Mali, for example, these countries called for the immediate and unconditional cancellation of Africa’s foreign debt and for fair payment for agricultural products and other raw materials. This is the price that has to be paid to rid the world of hunger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The World Food Summit in Rome did not give evidence of a similar pro-active approach. There is precious little evidence of political will or high priority granted to the fight against hunger, either in the participation of the Summit or in the release of resources. The most important industrial nations, the Group of 8, have decided not to set aside any extra funding either. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, money is not the key factor in the fight against hunger. Basic elements are market protection, bad governance and war. However, large-scale investments are needed in order effectively to combat hunger. The new G8 plan merits critical consideration, given the failures of previous plans to help Africa. There is no doubt that the setting of conditions on the aid offers an incentive for the much-needed improvement of governance in the recipient countries. However, the previous plan was unsuccessful because both rich and poor countries failed to honour the pledges. It leads one to believe that it is mainly the rich countries that were unable to live up to agreements. The opening-up of markets, more investment and more development aid are cases in point. Alongside this action plan for Africa, there is apparently a new plan by the FAO. Could the Commissioner give Parliament more details about this plan and also give his opinion on it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Summits should do more than simply pay lip service to the global fight against poverty and hunger. Yet the horrific statistics – 800 million people suffering from malnutrition, including 300 million children – have not changed at all. Every day, 24 000 people still die of hunger. Global population growth of 2.5 billion people by 2020 means that almost 90% of this increase will take place in the developing countries. The gap between prosperity and poverty is likely to widen, not narrow, as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the FAO, we are still a long way off achieving our target, which we adopted six years ago, of halving the world's hungry by 2015. Combating hunger and poverty is also an integral part of combating terrorism, international crime and illegal migration. This fight requires a holistic approach. The national strategies must focus on rural development and food security. Access to education and skills must be promoted, and water, renewable energies, health and agriculture must be put on the list of priorities for a new partnership to combat hunger in the world. We also need clear objectives and timescales, for otherwise, all these programmes will consist of nothing but empty promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the opening of the markets is important as well. However, the "Everything but<span class="italic"> </span>Arms" policy must not be over-estimated<span class="italic">.</span> The USA, too, must adapt its policies here within the WTO framework. The division of labour mooted by some people – whereby the developed world supplies industry and high-tech and the rest of the world, i.e. the less developed countries, is responsible for global food production – has nothing to commend it, in my view. Furthermore, not all the problems are due to poor distribution and re-distribution. The principle of good governance must be adopted and adhered to. The confiscation of the property of white farmers in Zimbabwe is at odds with good governance and will simply propel Southern Africa deeper into hunger. Here, too, the international and European community should clearly signal their indignation.</p>

A few days ago the Director-General of the FAO, Jacques Diouf, noted that, six years after the 1996 summit, ‘for the starving of the earth the bell still tolls.’ All the speakers have noted that 800 million people – including 300 million children – suffer from hunger and that every day 24 thousand people die of starvation. Mr Diouf has declared: ‘Promises have not been kept.’ Worse still, our actions contradict what we say. What actions were expected of us? Here are a couple of examples: investing in the Millennium goals, that is agriculture, health and education; and raising the level of aid from the G8 countries for this great battle to 0.7% of their gross domestic product. We have a long way to go when we think that the richest country, the United States, pays out only 0.1% or 34 dollars per head</p>
<p class="contents">The way the rich countries ignored this meeting added insult to injury. The Presidents of the United States and of Russia were absent; the Heads of Government of Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada were absent. Just Mr Prodi, representing the European Union, was present. All this casts a dangerous and evil shadow over the meeting of 26 August, the Johannesburg Summit. I believe we should remind ourselves that we do not yet have much new evidence on our side to be able to face up to and resolve this emergency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly not, however, on the part of the Italian Government – and I regret that a Member from the left did not miss the chance to make some shabby political speculation even about such a serious and sensitive matter. I must remind him that Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, managed to tread new ground at Genoa during the G8 by getting approval for an initial sum of EUR 750 million out of a new package worth 3 000 billion lire, or EUR 1 500 million. This is a concrete commitment and so these accusations are decidedly off-target.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are always new famines appearing round the world, and not only where there is the excuse of war to trigger them off. This scenario was debated thoroughly at the FAO meeting, particularly on the last morning, Thursday 13 June, when it was decided to give special attention to the problem of the world’s mountainous regions, where hunger and poverty are always more acute and show themselves in the most dreadful ways. At the meeting – which I had the opportunity to attend as rapporteur, since I tabled a resolution on mountainous regions in this Parliament in 1998 – it was also pointed out that one does not need to look in war zones or far-off regions to find signs of a worrying increase in abandonment, decay and even the possible scourge of famine in mountainous areas, even in civilised Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in the UN International Year of Mountains, this message is being passed from the FAO Assembly directly to this Parliament. We need to grant mountainous regions prominence and attention and restore their specific identity, but most of all we must not be ashamed to consider them already a potentially poor area. In short, this scourge of poverty can also be prevented, as well as combated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can probably summarise the contributions as follows: the EU is certainly moving in the right direction, but too little has been achieved. That is how I understand most of the contributions, and it is certainly true to say that summits in themselves do not eradicate hunger. Neither does this debate, but like this debate the summits help to put the problems into focus – both the problems that exist in the developing countries and also those that exist in the industrialised countries and which are the cause of too little being done.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Johannesburg summit, the Danish Presidency will place great importance on achieving a global deal with rights and obligations, with access to our markets, but also with certain obligations on those who are given this access. We do not know how far we can get, but it is important that we get a discussion concerning the overall complex of problems, because it is really a global deal that we need. I would like to emphasise that for all that, we have done something: we provide over 50% of total development aid in the world. We have brought about the “Everything but Arms” initiative and we are working to ensure that the agenda for development that was passed in Doha is implemented. In spite of everything, an agenda has been drawn up and words have been said, and it is now a matter of holding all the parties involved to these. So this debate on these vast, almost insurmountable problems concerns not losing the courage or the will to do more, despite everything. If things look too hopeless, people will not be motivated to act further. On the one hand, we need to be aware of the progress made; on the other, we must promise each other that we will do more.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council and the Presidency I am happy to give an undertaking that we will make substantial efforts in Johannesburg. It looks difficult and I cannot promise anything, but I can promise that efforts will be made. I believe that the Commissioner will say something similar, and I would like to thank him for the great commitment that he has made for many years to precisely the matter that we are discussing here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some have focused on the issue itself and others on the relationship between the dramatic increase in population and the number of people still lacking food. These are two complementary problems, which remind me of the dramatic vote in this House earlier today on sexual and reproductive health and rights. These matters have a lot to do with each other and certainly it is almost impossible to fight hunger meaningfully without also addressing the issue of population policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect which I have been focusing on more and more is the direct relationship between conflicts and hunger. Tanzania for as long as people can remember, has been host to more than half a million refugees in camps. They all have to be fed. They all add to the number of people we have to do something about to help them survive. Things could be different. The hungry people who are the casualties of conflict are a man-made disaster. Optimists would look at this as something we could change. But it is not only a matter of increasing agricultural production, it is also a matter of creating peace and a minimum of decency and governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have commented on the absence of leaders of our Member States, but President Prodi and I were there for the Commission and we did our part. Many others have focused on the relations between our agricultural policy in Europe and trade issues: Mr van den Berg, Mr van den Bos, Mrs Sandbæk and others.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that we need to avoid the overdoses of Euro-masochism which we often hear when we talk about these matters. To Mrs Sandbæk, I would like to say that even if it is Oxfam that comes up with these figures, characterising the EU as being the most protectionist bloc on this issue, the reality is still that we, in Europe, import more foodstuffs and more agricultural products from the third world than the combined imports of the United States, Japan, Canada and the other OECD countries outside the EU. This is still the reality. So there is a limit to how masochistic we should be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that subsidies are a big problem. This is very clear today and it will be a main topic of the discussions in Johannesburg. The figures are overwhelming. The OECD countries spend USD 350 billion a year on subsidies compared to USD 50 billion a year for development cooperation purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, our internal analysis in Europe corresponds to and goes in the same direction as the global pressure in regard to what we ought to do. In both cases the heading is 'reform and reduction of subsidies'. We hope to move forward on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van den Bos said there is too much monoculture and too little food security. I agree. One case in point is Ethiopia, which we have discussed again and again over the years. It is the biggest case of old-fashioned traditional food aid – shipping in wheat which is good for the farmers of Wisconsin and elsewhere but not good for the survivability and sustainability of people in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now agreeing a new approach with the Government of Ethiopia and even with the United States. This year we held seminars with the government, at which the Prime Minister was also present, to define a new food security approach, very different from the old food aid approach. This is exactly what I told Parliament – that we would like to see this change. It is coming. It is an approach I saw too little of in Mr Diouf's presentation of the agenda of the FAO. It is one cause of the frictions in our discussions with the FAO.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ó Neachtain, I send my warm regards to your close friends and constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, characterising Johannesburg as the last chance after Doha and Monterrey is a way of putting it with which I do not want to be identified. It makes it look as if Doha and Monterrey were both failures. This is not the case. In the European Union we can be pleased that due to our insistence and energetic input we have a Doha development agenda. Without the EU's insistence on this, it would not be so. Without the Barcelona decision leading up to Monterrey, we would not have come up with a real input. Without a real European input we would not have had the kind of American decision we saw.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not moving forward empty-handed. Rome was an occasion to re-establish the importance of the food issue in general. For that reason it was meaningful, even in its timing. But the next step is Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Haarder on the difficulties in the run-up to Johannesburg. We will have to work very hard during the weeks and months until then.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder asked about the new anti-hunger programme introduced by the FAO Secretary-General, Mr Diouf. The price tag of this programme, which was introduced only a few days before the summit, is USD 24 billion in additional public funds. The price tag is high. This was purely a secretariat initiative, not undertaken at the request of the members and not previously discussed with them. A lot of work needs to be done in order to support and justify this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be recalled that another recently adopted joint FAO/NEPAD comprehensive agricultural programme for Africa calls for the investment of an additional USD 240 billion between now and 2015. So we are definitely not running short of magnificent initiatives involving billions and billions of new additional money coming from the secretariat of the FAO. Most of this money, however, is coming from the secretariat without any sort of real discussion and coordination with the donors or the membership in general. This is one of the reasons why we have not found it very easy to relate constructively to everything we have been presented with in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">All this should not be misunderstood as reflecting a negative attitude. We are working with the FAO; we are carrying out a number of good projects in Africa; we are funding it through our regional envelope when our partners in Africa ask us to act hand-in-hand with the FAO in areas where it has real expertise. Some things do work.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to clarify this issue. I warn against the temptation of thinking that no progress is being made at all.

It is a man-made and political issue. That has to be kept in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
