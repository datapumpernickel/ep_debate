<p class="contents">As we explained in the text, many Member States have not implemented this directive. Discussions are taking place between the Commission, the services concerned and the Member State representatives, and in the context of CEIOPS. However, Parliament as co-legislator should also claim to have a role in interpretations if there really are problems with the directive. This is why we asked you to come here to discuss this with us, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading between the lines, you will also note our concern that Member States are not taking implementation of the directive seriously. We also urge you to make an important issue of the Pensions Directive – because it is a separate issue specifically concerning financial markets and social policy – particularly where respect for national, social and labour laws are at stake and where host country rules, rather than the country of origin principle, are prevalent. We are eager to be involved closely in the outcome of the implementation and the possible interpretations.</p>
<p class="contents">We raised two other issues: the involvement of CEIOPS and the state of affairs regarding the prudential rules, as well as possible additional quantitative rules added by Member States, but I will not go into details on those.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important point for me, not just as spokesperson for the PSE Group, but also as a Dutch delegate, is my concern over developments in occupational pension schemes due not only to financial market developments but also to regulatory developments: there is a trend to move from defined benefit to defined contribution systems.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very fast-growing development in the UK and Ireland, where in particular new participants in schemes are not given a defined benefit system. That is not possible in the Netherlands because we have collective systems and obligatory systems in most cases, and we are very attached to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree that a shift from defined benefits to defined contribution is a necessary development, let alone a desirable one, because the quality of pension schemes is a major asset of the European social model. The first pillar in the Netherlands would be incomplete and insufficient without a second pillar of such high quality. It is also important that this tradition give the best overall results. Therefore, these blurred borders are also a concern for us and we would invite you to clarify your interpretation of these developments and how you will debate this issue further with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Othmar Karas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs van den Burg has already said, we are concerned – concerned about the lack of seriousness with which this directive has been transposed since it was adopted two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two sides to this directive: one has to do with the internal market, which the directive makes stronger for all service providers in the field of occupational retirement provision, and the other has to do with social security for workers, with more dialogue between employers and workers when occupational retirement schemes are set up and in the course of their further development.</p>
<p class="contents">Boarding the airliner this morning, I was handed a magazine. The headline on the cover stated that there would, in future, be no getting away from occupational retirement provision. As you, Commissioner, will have seen from having read the new German Government’s working agreement, two substantial paragraphs of which are devoted to securing the old age pension system, this has become no less important an issue in the years since the directive was drafted and adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still not enough risk capital in the European Union; in the USA, as we are well aware, it is the pension funds that do most to create it. The internal market and the financial services sector still offer potential. The pension funds – the businesses that deal with occupational pension provision – do not yet enjoy a complete single internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Much is at present being said about the European lifestyle model and the European social model. Occupational retirement provision, which involves more of the market at the same time as social security – is an essential precondition for workers’ mobility and flexibility, as well as for the securing of our systems of provision for old age and of securing a comfortable old age in a society in which people live for longer and longer.</p>
<p class="contents">What this directive also makes clear is that there is an imbalance in powers and responsibilities, an imbalance between single market competence and social security systems. This is something that the directive attempts to rectify, but it is also the very reason why we are putting this question, for it is the Member States that are empowered to transpose this directive and to take account of those aspects that we have addressed but that are not set down in law; they are also responsible for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">From your speeches and from the facts, we know that, to date, only six Member States have notified their transposition measures; six more have done so in part and 13 are unaccounted for. As things stood on 23 September 2005, 13 states had not done what they were supposed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is why we are asking you what action you propose taking if, by the end of the year, not all the Member States have transposed this directive. What is it that makes it so difficult for them to do that? Unless I am misinformed, there were meetings of the Member States and the Commission in October 2004 and April 2005, at which it became evident that its provisions relating to social security and labour law were the source of the most problems. We have to face up to the tension between these two; the one must not be an excuse for a blockade by the other, whether in the single market or in the necessary security measures that we have addressed in our directive, and so we also ask you what conclusions you draw from this, whether you believe that more measures will be needed and what effect the disparities in tax legislation have on the transposition of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be emphasised that such infringement procedures concern only the communication of national measures and do not refer to the quality of the implementation. Once complete notifications have been received, the Commission will examine the national implementing measures, which might at a later stage lead to infringement proceedings due to incorrect implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not confer any comitology powers on the Commission. It is not a ‘Lamfalussy’ directive. Therefore, no mandates are given to the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors – CEIOPS – nor will any implementing measures be adopted by the Commission. As there is no practical experience with the directive yet, it is too early to take a position on the need for comitology and, therefore, on the role CEIOPS could take in this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, CEIOPS has an important role to play in the context of Article 21(2) of the directive and supervisors have the duty ‘to collaborate closely with a view to facilitating supervision of the operations of institutions for occupational retirement provision’. In that respect, CEIOPS’ Occupational Pensions Committee is currently drafting a multilateral cooperation protocol, such as already exists for insurance. A draft is out now for a second open consultation with stakeholders. It is expected to be adopted by the CEIOPS members’ meeting in February 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past two years, the Commission has organised two meetings with Member States in order to help them implement the directive. To that end, the discussions focused on issues identified by Member States, the Commission and other stakeholders as a potential source of difficulty for the transposition and which may give rise to a diverging interpretation by the Member States. On the basis of those meetings, the Commission has concluded that although some articles appear to cause problems, that is not the case for all Member States. Hence it is difficult to define any particularly problematic provisions. This is not surprising, since Member States’ pension structures and arrangements differ significantly. Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that the implementation of Article 20 – cross-border activities – causes problems for many Member States. However, it is too early to assess whether the origin of those problems lies in the formulation of the legislative proposal as adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, or just in different interpretations in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2006, a first meeting will be organised to discuss further some of the issues which have been identified as problematic and essential during the examination of the national implementing measures. The in-depth analysis of the national measures transposing the directive has not yet begun. At this stage the work focuses on the quality of the partial or full notifications. An indication as to the extent to which Member States have adopted additional quantitative investment rules and elements that might jeopardise the proper functioning of the directive can only be provided once most Member States have notified. As the Commission expects a large number of Member States to communicate their legislation to the Commission before the end of this year, such an indication can only be provided in the course of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of defined benefit pension schemes took advantage of the 1990s bull market to reduce the level of contributions or even take contribution holidays instead of building up their financial reserves. When the inevitable market downturn occurred, some of these reserves were found to be insufficient. In response, sponsoring undertakings and Member States’ supervisory authorities employed different solutions: increased contributions, top-up payments, reduced indexation of pension rights, changes in the pension schemes’ rules and the closure of schemes to new entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of the remedies applied, all stakeholders again realised that a pension fund involves a long-term commitment to employees and pensioners. This recognition has only been reinforced by other developments, including the application of IAS 19 for sponsoring undertakings and stricter rules for the supervisory valuation of technical provisions. Sponsoring undertakings have realised the need to achieve improved cost control and more stable earnings in order to match their pension promises.</p>
<p class="contents">A shift from traditionally defined benefit final pay schemes to pension schemes whose cost can be more easily controlled can indeed be observed. However, there is clear evidence that this shift has not been solely towards purely individual defined contribution schemes. Hybrid schemes combining defined benefit and defined contribution elements are also available. The rationale behind all these changes is better cost control and more stability in earnings for the sponsoring undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a trend towards some blurring of the borderline between the three pension pillars, not just between the occupational second pillar and the individual third pillar, but also between the second pillar and the statutory first pillar. This is not a problem, as the pillar structure is only a general classification system, and schemes where assets are allocated to individuals are to be found in all three pillars. This is not the case in every Member State, as pensions reflect specific cultural and historical situations. Thus, although the basic differences between the first, second and third pillars will remain, the solutions envisaged may be equivalent.</p>
<p class="contents">Different choices have been made in the 25 Member States as to the existence, level and funding of state schemes, occupational schemes and individual arrangements. There is not one EU-wide answer to the challenges of the ageing society. Appropriate solutions must be adapted to Member States’ different pension systems. Therefore, the final responsibility lies with Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could be of help to Member States by ensuring that the European regulatory framework for financial services supports the emergence of secure market-driven responses to retirement financing. Bottlenecks must be removed so that assets earmarked for retirement can be managed as efficiently as possible, thus allowing Europeans to enjoy the highest possible payouts and annuities on retirement. The directive fulfils this objective. In the second half of next year, the Commission will present a white paper in the field of UCITS, which also play a role in the pension arena.</p>
<p class="contents">Other initiatives that aim at improving European pension provision include the recently adopted proposal for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights, and the ongoing infringement cases in the field of equal tax treatment of pension contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That there is such dragging of heels when it comes to the transposition of the directive on occupational retirement schemes is not only disappointing but also – or so I believe – negligent.</p>
<p class="contents">Occupational pension schemes are burgeoning within the European Union, and the directive itself offers nation states enough scope to be able to organise them properly. The population statistics are changing dramatically, and many states are, for ideological reasons, progressively withdrawing from retirement and healthcare provision, the idea being that private provision should step into the gap. If pensions are to be secured in future, other areas of capital-building retirement provision will have to be promoted and managed with vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">If occupational pension schemes are to be a stable means of making additional provision for old age, there must be a guarantee of the risks to employees being reduced in real terms, for they already risk losing their jobs and must not also risk their own voluntary contributions, and the contributions made by the companies they work for, being put in jeopardy. That is why there must be an explicit separation guaranteed between the businesses and the institution for occupational retirement provision, so that, for example, the entitlements acquired are not lost in the event of the business going bust or the employee changing job of his or her own accord.</p>
<p class="contents">A single market for occupational retirement provision organised on a European scale would mean more mobility for workers, and that is precisely what they want. Alongside the decoupling of the risk of job loss from the risk of employees’ claims on the amassed capital in the event of the business going into administration, there must be minimum standards for occupational pension institutions, which must involve explicit information rights for both the supervisory authorities and the employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Both those entitled to benefits and those actually in receipt of them must be entitled to receive information on the way in which their scheme’s capital is invested or on the state of the stock market. Employees should also, if possible, have a right to be consulted by their companies when the choice of these institutions is made. If the objectives named in recitals 18 to 23 are achieved, that not only puts the workers in a more secure position, but is also what modern stock market supervision in the Community requires. Now, Commissioner, is the time for action, and action is what we are used to getting from you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, incentives to take up pensions, as he has quite rightly said, remains a competence of the Member States as these may be linked with the tax and benefits systems. I am not proposing that there should be any change to that. Nevertheless, it is important to share best practice. Could the Commission therefore indicate whether it is already monitoring incentives or has plans to do so? Can it envisage a mechanism through which best practices can be shared and encouraged?</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of cross-border provisions, which we want to encourage in order to achieve a better and more vibrant pensions market, public confidence in all regulators and underlying guarantees – and not just in those of one’s own state – is very important. It is also important, especially for schemes relating to the self-employed, that it is understood that the information provided by the different countries should be comparable. Article 9 of the directive requires that members be given sufficient information on risks. Article 10 requires that the annual accounts should give a true, fair and comprehensive view. Other articles provide that members should have access to those accounts. However, this raises the question of what constitutes sufficient information, and whether account will be taken of the differences between prevailing practices in Member States, or at least whether potential investors will be alerted to the differences that may exist in areas in which they are not comparing like with like.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly it is also important for the solution found to this not to result in a multiplication of regulation and for CEIOPS to take that into account in any forthcoming protocols. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sounds rather unsavoury to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Is not the real problem of the implementation of the directive on occupational pension schemes that there is no political will for its implementation? In western Europe there is a serious demographic problem as the population grows ever older, with the birth rate continuing to fall in the leading industrial countries of the European Union. There is a major pensions crisis, which national governments are simply failing to address. In the case of final-salary schemes, as indeed with public service pensions, the concept is that young people pay for the old; that one generation supports the next.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the demographics that are against the old economies of western Europe, but also the so-called social model. This much prized social model seems to consist of 40% youth unemployment, welfare dependency and the break-up of the traditional family. Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place, as well as of national government, we cannot rely on the generational support system any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in the United Kingdom, it is politically even worse: there are over GBP 800 billion of unfunded public service pensions, with recruitment in the public sector out of control. Pension funds in the private sector have been taxed since 1977, taking over GBP 5.5 billion every year out of ordinary people’s savings, whilst politicians enjoy privileged pensions at the expense of the hard-pressed taxpayer. Indeed, if public companies now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts, the director would face prison, yet national government finance ministers flout the rules daily.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own constituency there is a company called Ballast Nedam which has simply abandoned its pensioners in a most disgraceful way and set up a new company to avoid its responsibilities. This is quite against the directive, which has failed to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not interesting how keen governments are to standardise car heaters, windscreen wipers and spirit bottles but, when real people need help, as usual the European Union is found wanting? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are financial market institutions and cannot be connected to or it cannot be implied that they can gradually acquire such scope that they can even partially replace the social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The social security systems must continue to guarantee general coverage of workers and they are public systems; in other words, if the insurance fund cannot pay pension benefits and liabilities, the state must meet their financial liabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, if occupational pension funds are unable to meet their liabilities, there is no financial intervention or guarantee by the state.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I clearly support the fact that these funds are useful as credit institutions which undertake to guarantee auxiliary pensions, insofar as they are decided within the framework of collective agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it must be emphasised that they only provide a retirement income in the case of workers, creating a degree of discrimination against those who do not have stable employment or who work part time.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be emphasised that these credit institutions, these funds, only have the facility for cross-border cooperation with countries in the present eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these characteristics and the development of the application of the legislation to the Member States, it is advisable for the directive to be promoted in all the Member States, but to become more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is to integrate the directive into national law and, most importantly, for it to be accepted by the social partners, by employers and employees.</p>
<p class="contents">In this direction, it does not seem to make sense to use averages in order to ascertain the breadth of coverage of the workforce by the funds in question or the capitalisation of these funds and their accumulated reserves as a percentage of GDP or per insured.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, highlighting the factors which contributed to the development of the institution in specific individual countries, where the confidence of the workforce attains an average of 45%, also appears to be of exceptional importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The parameters which contribute to the serious disparity in the application of this directive in the various Member States need to be abolished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
