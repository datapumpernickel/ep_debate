I have been a member of the Central Asian Delegation for the last two years and was privileged to visit Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan with the European Parliament Delegation in May 1997. This is an exotic destination for Europeans with its image of the ‘silk route". I was particularly struck by the warmth and friendship for Europeans expressed by the people we met.</p>
<p class="contents">We visited the Aral Sea and saw at first hand the environmental problems that exist. We also learned of the economic problems of those landlocked countries and the difficulties of transition from Soviet domination to independence and the change to a market economy. I have recently learned from the ambassadors at the last meeting that the problems have increased with the collapse of the Russian rouble.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must point out that there are considerable human rights problems in Central Asia as was vividly expressed by Mr Truscott this morning, although the extent of the problems varies from country to country. Consequently, although I give the interim agreements a cautious welcome I must ask that the Commission to remain vigilant on human rights and, whenever possible, continue to point out to the respective countries the need to observe human rights properly.</p>

I had the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, and he took full account of the recommendations I made, which can really be summed up in one proposal. The Commission"s proposals are very good, but we in the Committee on External Economic Relations would stress that they need to be incorporated into an overall policy, so that the infrastructure work, communications, pipelines, roads – everything that has been planned to help open up the countries of Central Asia and enable them to become part of a modern economy – will be dealt with all together rather than in isolation to create a genuine basis for their development. This proposal was accepted without amendment. The rapporteur said he was happy with it and the text before the House therefore takes due account of it. I think this is an excellent example of cooperation between different committees and rapporteurs, for which I should like to thank Mr Truscott once again.</p>

<p class="contents">For my part, I have also seen that in some of these states, or in practically all of them, there is a clear lack of democracy and respect for human rights. If pressed, we can appreciate how difficult the transition to a free regime and a market economy can be. But I have always defended the theory that the important thing is that these countries did not stop working towards these freedoms, rather they were heading in the right direction to a greater or lesser degree. It would have been unfair to ask these countries to behave in the same way as our consolidated Western democracies. There has been a certain lack of understanding and it is clear that the development we wished to see is indeed taking place. It is perhaps slow, but it is happening nonetheless. I am therefore delighted to see that, in the text of the recommendation on Uzbekistan, the rapporteur explicitly welcomes the efforts made by the authorities there to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. I am also pleased that the report by Mr Truscott welcomes the progress that has been made towards establishing a functioning democracy along the terms set out in the CSCE documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we must not forget that the guarantee of democracy also comes into play as soon as the corresponding partnership and cooperation agreements include a conditional clause linking such cooperation to democratic principles, human rights and the rules of the market economy. As regards developing these principles, the government of Uzbekistan has stressed that it is willing to make progress in this field. And as proof of this, it cites the fact that offices of the OSCE, Human Rights Watch and the Uzbekistan National Centre for Human Rights have already been opened and that an ombudsman has been appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, an excessive delay in ratifying such an agreement could cause problems during the country"s transition to democracy. And the importance of this country for Europe in terms of energy is very clear from a socioeconomic perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, we support the recommendation and the report.</p>

The countries that sign up to them must be prepared to tread the right path towards democracy and human rights. Ten years ago, no one knew where Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan were; perhaps if you had read the book ‘The Courier of the Tsar" you might know where Central Asia began, but not where it ended. This is why I think it is a good thing that now, ten years after the Wall came down and what we called the Russian bear disappeared, we politicians can blithely say ‘these countries are going to do this and this". I therefore wholeheartedly endorse Mrs André‐Léonard"s report on the partnership agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the Commission communication on the whole of Central Asia. The agreement on intensive human rights dialogue will be a way of both encouraging and checking up on the countries in question, which are to be actively monitored and advised. Should they relapse, we can always suspend the agreement, although I would not recommend this. We must be patient in view of their history and the ground they need to make up socially, for whatever reason. Some of us may have known where Uzbekistan was, but I find it a liberating experience to be able to find out about this huge area of our planet in this way. I should like to thank both rapporteurs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schroedter </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, may I say to my colleague Mr Bertens that we should not always judge others by our own standards. We have an important responsibility, which arose, of course, when the Wall came down, for the East and for ensuring that its difficult transformation process leads to the development of democracy and stability. For that reason, I am inclined to wonder about the real motive behind the interest of the European Union in close relations with the states of the East. When I examine the Commission documents, the Council statement and even the Truscott report, I begin to doubt whether the issue is really the stable development of these countries or whether it is all about their natural resources. Are we more interested in those countries' natural resources than in the future of their people?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why one of the key issues for me concerns the ways in which this partnership and cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan and comparable agreements with other states actually affect stability and the balanced social and economic development of these countries. I have my doubts there as far as the exploitation of natural resources is concerned. For that reason, I attach paramount importance to the human rights and democracy clause, because democracy is an absolutely categorical imperative if difficulties in the transformation process are to be properly overcome. The population must be involved; employees must have a say. For the second time today, I am led to wonder about the value of this human rights clause if there is no way of penalising violations of human rights, if such violations are simply condoned as before, and if the human rights clause cannot be used to guarantee the creation of genuinely democratic and stable structures in the country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">So here is the situation: we have no clear division of powers, we have problems with free and fair elections, we have huge problems with freedom of the press, the death penalty is still on the statute book, we have criminal trials against opposition newspapers, against journalists, against interest groups and against demonstrators. That is the problem. To my mind, the question we have to ask the Commission once again is whether this agreement is really the answer, or should we not actually be doing far, far more for these countries?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it prudent for us, before we ratify this agreement, to reconsider which measures are actually in place to stabilise this region. I should also like to remind the House that we also have an obligation under the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. We must ensure that the requirements of that Convention are satisfied before we can recognise these states as reliable partners. The same clause is contained in the partnership and cooperation agreement. We cannot rubber‐stamp the agreement before the proper conditions are created.</p>

Their populations are not homogenous. They cannot rely on state traditions as they are emerging states that up until now have only been Empire dependencies. They are used as a channel by the drug rings, and they have to assert their existence in a highly dangerous international environment. They are caught between Russia, which is the former dominant power and which still has a considerable interest in the area, Turkey, whose ambition is still to be the leader of a great, Turkish‐speaking Central Asia, and Pakistan, which supports a plan for a great, fundamentalist Afghanistan, on the basis of the particularly dangerous tool of militant Islamism, just as Iran does.</p>
<p class="contents">We must of course be vigilant with regard to respect for human rights in all regions, but if we judge these countries solely by normal human rights standards, we are in danger of condemning ourselves to powerlessness and ineffectiveness, which other countries such as the United States know how to avoid. We must be capable of looking beyond the rulers of the Soviet era who are still in place, the powerful mafias and the <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span> seeking to go on for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take account of the encouraging fact that, apart from the tragic events in Tajikstan, these countries are not ravaged by civil wars and there is a tradition of secularism which could form a barrier against the spread of Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore better not to subject the implementation of partnership agreements with these countries to conditions that would deprive us of any form of influence. We have seen that postponing the agreements is ineffective. It would be more appropriate to provide ourselves with specific tools for action, which must be closely coordinated, under the auspices of the Council, with the Union"s other instruments for external action and with the bilateral policies of the Member States. That, Mr President, is the price of effectiveness.</p>

It is a country that is suffering from the effects of the Russian crisis as well as having felt the full impact of the fall in raw material prices, as is rightly noted in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be recognised that the government of Uzbekistan has taken some steps to improve the human rights situation by admitting an observer from the OSCE and by appointing an ombudsman. The continuing existence of the death penalty and the atrocious conditions in the country's prisons, however, show that there is still a huge gap between our expectations and the situation on the ground. By conferring its approval, the European Parliament is also recognising the will of the government, which has at least been documented for the outside world, to improve the human rights situation in this part of Central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Commission report calls for Parliament to be presented with an annual report on democracy and human rights and for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to be kept informed of developments is a sign that Uzbekistan has a long way to go before it can complete the process of democratisation and stabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have grounds for concern, not only on account of the ethnic tensions that keep flaring up between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, but also because of the Ferghana Valley, which has to be regarded as a potential trouble spot. The partition of the valley among three states after the collapse of the Soviet Union has fuelled ethnic conflicts. The region is far from having overcome the destabilisation and general economic depression that resulted from the partition of this valley, which was one of the most fertile and densely populated in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause for concern is the fact that the Ferghana Valley, as well as being a tourist centre, is also a hotbed of drug trafficking and internationally organised crime and a breeding‐ground for Islamic fundamentalism. The brutal bombings on 16 January of this year illustrate how tense the situation remains. Indeed, it was the most serious act of violence in Central Asia since Uzbekistan became independent. The way in which it was carried out suggests very thorough organisation, although the Karemov government has been anxious to play down the incident. We believe that stabilisation can only be achieved if the TACIS programmes are used in pursuit of specific targets and if the ethnic conflicts are defused.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint debate today highlights the particular importance that Parliament attaches to the issue of human rights in all the countries of Central Asia and particularly in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the decision by your rapporteur, Mrs André‐Léonard, to ratify the cooperation and partnership agreement with Uzbekistan. Continuing to veto this agreement would have penalised the country and would have had the involuntary yet negative effect of reducing the level of protection of human rights. It would also have had a negative effect on the process of transition to democracy, as Mr Camisón Asensio has just pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the trade and cooperation agreement and the interim agreement that have been applied up until now to bilateral relations between the Union and Uzbekistan, this new partnership and cooperation agreement will enable us to directly tackle the issue of human rights through political dialogue. This partnership agreement will provide a structural framework for political dialogue and will also cover economic, commercial and cultural matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to your rapporteur, Mrs André‐Léonard, I can confirm that Mr van den Broek is committed to discussing the issue of human rights at the various bilateral meetings, and particularly during his next visit to Tashkent at the end of March. He will report back to you on this, as you requested this morning, Mrs André‐Léonard.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan is currently experiencing difficult times, as Mr Rübig reminded us a moment ago. From an economic point of view, the fall in the price of cotton – which is its main export in terms of raw materials – is largely responsible for the deterioration in its balance of trade. From a political point of view, the wave of explosive attacks on Tashkent demonstrates the fragility and sensitivity of the situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Broek immediately wrote to the President of Uzbekistan to offer his condolences to the families of the victims, but also to remind him that the legitimate search for the perpetrators of the attacks should be carried out with full respect for individual rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs André Léonard, a moment ago, you mentioned that the Uzbek Ambassador was here to listen to your debates and I would like to welcome him this evening. Allow me, on behalf of the Commission, to reiterate the appeal you made to him.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these problems, the Uzbek Government is working to step up the economic reforms and to improve the protection of human rights. The recent contacts that we have had with the authorities have highlighted their determination to continue along this path.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on Mr Truscott"s report. This report relates to the 1995 Commission communication and also focuses on the issue of human rights. In particular, it draws a comparison between all the Central Asian republics and the Commission shares your rapporteur"s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to point out that, as in the case of Uzbekistan, all the partnership and cooperation agreements provide the legal framework and, in my opinion, a basis and an appropriate structure to look at the issue of human rights with the countries concerned. This is the reason behind the political dialogue, which, for the first time in the Union"s bilateral relations with these countries, is officially laid down in each agreement. Mr van den Broek will keep you closely informed of the development of the situation in the area, as Mr Truscott also requested this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in relation to Uzbekistan, but also in relation to Kazakhstan and Kyrghyzstan, the 1998‐1999 national TACIS programmes envisage projects that will facilitate the implementation of these partnership and cooperation agreements. In this respect, the Commission has made it clear that the priority is to promote democracy within the society, including by helping with the preparation of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the context of these partnership and cooperation agreements, a parliamentary cooperation committee will be set up for each country. This will allow for direct discussions between the representatives of the parliaments of each of the Central Asian republics and the European Parliament. In this way, Parliament will itself be able to bring up the issue of the protection of human rights in an appropriate context and increase its control over the bilateral relations between the Union and the Central Asian countries.</p>
