<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fava (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, we are on the home straight with a report, a Commission initiative which Parliament warmly welcomed and which we feel is one of the most important aspects of the work which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has carried out in recent years: a single European sky, with efficiency, safety and cost containment as its objectives. It is clear that the single sky is a practical combination of conduct and rules, certainly not a literary metaphor: rules and synergies which must be defined, applied and respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission proposal had the merit – we pay tribute to the Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio, for this – of courageously raising this issue with force and with urgency, and within the deadlines. A year ago, Parliament commendably took up the Commission’s challenge at a difficult time, following 11 September, at a time when discussing safety in our skies required increased sensitivity, reasoning and attention. Parliament met this challenge, and gave its support with a broad, firm consensus to this draft, which was adopted at first reading and which was subject to certain simple rules which we hope will be reconfirmed and applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The most basic rule is the necessary harmony, the necessary synergy between all the institutions, all the bodies, all the organisations which are involved in putting into practice the objectives of the single sky – efficiency, safety and keeping costs down – and, therefore, first and foremost, focus, punctuality and the definition of a clear relationship between Eurocontrol – the agency which has dealt with the technical expertise side of managing the European skies – and the Commission, the European Union. In this regard we have managed to reach a very specific balance which confers on the Commission the task, the responsibility of the management, of the political regulation of our single European sky, and calls on Eurocontrol to make available its expertise, its experience and its technical know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental point is sanctions: a system of sanctions – which will, of course, be deferred until the various States have fully defined them – which can be used to punish the airlines and other parties concerned in the event that these rules are violated. The word ‘sanction’ is always an unpleasant word, a word which should always be spoken with great restraint and great care, but it is a necessary word in this case. It has been since the time of Cesare Beccaria: if we do not have a system of sanctions, it will be hard to be sure that rules will be respected. This is a system of rules which does not allow exceptions, apart from in certain very special cases; it is a system of rules based on respect, for otherwise the concept of a single sky would not be fully realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is cooperation between civil and military users. Cooperation between civil and military authorities is the distinguishing point: to this end, a single sky committee is provided for, in which the military are also to participate; there is also a safeguard clause which gives Member States the possibility of deferring certain single sky regulations should special situations or special emergencies arise, and this naturally lies first of all within the role and function of the armed forces and the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, with regard to all these points, the common position may well have been affected by a climate which, following 11 September, is giving much greater consideration to national sovereignty and national security. It is, in any case, a position which we consider to be quite conservative. Cooperation between civil and military users is essentially pushed aside. The single sky is losing one of its major distinguishing characteristics. We feel that, in this respect, there may have been a certain naive short-sightedness. Cooperation between civil and military authorities should be considered not as a restriction on Member States’ sovereignty but as a great opportunity, an opportunity which, moreover, is guaranteed by an extended safeguard clause, which we have only prevented being extended to cover simple training too for otherwise the very concept of a single European sky would be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not have anything else to add. I have briefly summarised the basic developments of the political and institutional background to this report. I hope that, in the coming weeks and months, in a balanced trialogue with the other institutions, Parliament will be able to contribute to the swift definition of a set of regulations which will be a credit to the work of the Commission, the Council and, of course, Parliament, so that we will, at last, be able to provide the European citizens with a single, safe sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sanders-ten Holte (ELDR),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I speak for the majority of my colleagues when I say that our main reaction to the Council common position on the Single Sky was a sense of disappointment. In the field of safety, the Council fortunately sensed the feelings of the European Parliament accurately. It also introduced greater clarity to the original Commission proposal. Many of the European Parliament's fundamental wishes have been largely disregarded, however, and that is regrettable. I will now go into more detail on the conditions that we consider necessary in order to bring about a successful Single European Sky.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we should like to see a clear commitment – laid down by law – so that the Commission can find a solution regarding the certification and training of air-traffic controllers. We also want the Member States to improve the recruitment of these professionals. I also think that all providers of air-navigation services should be free of conflicts of interest, should be adequately staffed, and should ensure that access to their services is non-discriminatory with regard to all airspace users. In addition, we want charging for these services to be transparent, and we want it to offer incentives to improve safety and efficiency. Commissioner, we do not want a better-integrated airspace, we want a Single European Sky, and I hope that you put that across to the Council, too. That means that we are calling for a clear, unambiguous commitment to a single European Flight Information Region, first in the higher and then in the lower airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also striving for successful implementation of all the elements in the package, and also, therefore – perhaps most importantly – of the elements relating to interoperability. I know that you also place a strong emphasis on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we consider it extremely important that the Member States give a clear, unambiguous signal that they are serious about wanting to rearrange European airspace into cross-border airspace blocks. Without the commitment to do this, a single airspace would be a hollow shell, with no hope of success. That is why Amendment No 26 in my report is so important. In addition to the decisive priority of safety, airspace management is also an economic sector. Without a stimulus from the EU, each Member State will tend to pursue its own interests in that sector. Were this not the case, the cross-border airspace blocks would have been established much earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the desires of the Member States do not always represent the best interests of citizens. Passengers have a right to fewer delays and to even greater flight safety. Moreover, the people on the ground sometimes get overlooked, but they also have similar rights. They have to be able to take it for granted that flying is as safe as possible, and that the adverse effects on the environment are minimal, by permitting the crew to fly to their destination via the most direct route. That is exactly what the rearrangement of European airspace is to bring about. We would ask that the Member States let go the reins of sovereignty over their airspace in order to achieve that aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I do of course understand the sensitivities of the Member States regarding cooperation between civil and military airspace management. I also respect the legal constraints that the EC Treaty imposes on us in this area. However, Commissioner, I do not believe that the Council has achieved the maximum possible in this field. On top of what is known as the flexible use of airspace, there are certainly other possibilities for improving cooperation between civil and military airspace managers without contravening the EC Treaty or jeopardising Member States' defence competences. No one wants to undermine the effectiveness of the European military air forces; we only want to ensure that the use of the airspace is optimised as far as possible by means of better communication and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank my colleagues for their great cooperation throughout the process. The successful coordination with my colleague Mr Fava improved and strengthened both of our proposals. They still differ on one small point, and my group has therefore requested a separate vote for Amendment No 14. We are afraid that the Commission is being kept on leading reins too much. Apart from that, however, I think that we can really look forward to a quick, efficient trialogue enabling us to keep to the original timetable for the implementation of the Single Sky, and that is in the interests of all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank them for their particular dedication to an issue which is very complex from a technical and institutional point of view. I believe – and I say this as a preface to the issues I am going to explain later – that, on certain aspects, the honourable Members may possibly have wanted more and, in particular, much clearer definitions, but the consideration that I wish to communicate to you is that, in this particular case, we are opening up totally new fields.</p>
<p class="contents">In the air sector we are entering into fields which so far had been kept completely outside of any type of regulation or agreement at European Union level. I would therefore like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the Members, who I know have participated very actively throughout the discussions in committee, and to remind them of something that we all know: until 2000 this sector has developed systematically, in the intergovernmental field, by means of Eurocontrol or the International Civil Aviation Authority. As Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said a moment ago, however, we all know that the demands of the citizens go further, that they are asking us to resolve urgent problems and there is a possibility of significantly improving the capacity and safety of our airspace and the efficiency of its management, if we are capable, in this respect as well, of introducing an integration at European level. The objective is therefore to make the organisation and the management of the air space coherent with mobility in the skies, to create a single sky before the end of 2004. And the honourable Members know that this is one of the emblematic initiatives of this Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, in the meantime, events have taken place, which certain Members have referred to, such as the crisis in the aviation sector relating to certain factors, 11 September, the war in Iraq, the Uberlingen accident, which have undoubtedly affected our work, but that, in no case have they undermined either the importance of the initiative or the urgency of implementing it. I would like to point out that, regrettably, it does not appear that your reactions to the Council’s common position are going to allow an agreement to be reached at second reading. The questions the honourable Members are asking appear to me to be legitimate and they deserve to be discussed in Council, but we must be aware, when dealing with this initiative, that – and I insist – we are entering new territory for the first time, and it involves several delicate aspects, and we must therefore make progress gradually and the work we are doing is very delicate, that the Council has to accept this step forward and that we must be pragmatic and realistic, and achieve operative texts which promote the immediate achievement of concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that you believe that the final proposal in the Council's common position is not sufficient and that you are calling for greater action at Community level. I would like to say to the honourable Members that of course I share your concern, but that there are legal institutional obstacles which prevent us from accepting some of the amendments you have presented, such as, for example, in the case of the report by Mr Fava, Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 and, in the case of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Amendments Nos 13, 16, 25, 29 and 33. With regard to the other amendments, either in principle, in part or with a modification to the wording, we will be able to incorporate them, when the time comes, partially, if not in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that we still oppose certain amendments which could affect or prejudice the institutional operative reality. The amendments which I have said are not acceptable include, specifically, Amendment No 14, on the consultation of the interested parties within Eurocontrol, as well as the amendments in the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Nos 13, 16, 25 and 29, the second part of Amendment No 15 and Amendment No 33, which has become obsolete as a result of technological progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I will raise two issues which will take centre stage in the coming discussions between the institutions within the framework of the conciliation and which the honourable Members have referred to: civil/military cooperation and the creation of functional blocks, the first of which is taken up in both reports and the second in Amendment No 26 by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.</p>
<p class="contents">The civil/military issue is a key element for the success of the single sky, as the honourable Members rightly say, but you must also remember what the competences are at Community level, and this is the restriction we are faced with in relation to the whole of this issue. The discussions in the Council have demonstrated that balancing the needs of the transport policy and the demands of defence policy require coordination mechanisms which go beyond the possibilities offered in the first pillar. In order to support the creation of the single sky, despite this obstacle, the States of the Union have committed themselves, in a declaration, to developing military cooperation as a complement to the initiative in the context of the first pillar. I believe we must take advantage of this opportunity and proceed pragmatically in this field. Amendment No 29 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte establishes that transport policy has primacy in the use of the single sky, and this does not sufficiently reflect the legitimate needs and concerns of the Member States from the point of view of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second aspect, the functional blocks, Amendment No 26 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, the Commission shares Parliament's point of view, but believes that an acceptable solution would be to strengthen the role of the Commission in combination with the ‘single sky committee’ and with the technical support of Eurocontrol, with a view to coherently assessing all of these blocks, maintaining the Member States’ right to initiative and decision-making. The creation of these blocks affects the military aspects, which I referred to in the first part of my speech. We therefore accept Amendment No 26 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte in principle, but we will have to change the wording.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that the proposals we are discussing today are the result of one year’s work by a high-level group, made up of civilian and military representatives from the Member States of the Union, and of a social group consisting of the various agents in the civil aviation sector and also with participation at all levels of this field. In September 2002 you issued your opinion at first reading and at that time I thanked you for your support and the effort you dedicated to this initiative. We agree in many respects, but I would insist that what we need is a realistic position which allows us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for your support, and in particular the work of the two rapporteurs, and I hope that in the conciliation stage we can rapidly achieve a positive result which allows us to create the famous Single European Sky before the end of 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One may well wonder whether this is just a haughtily offhand attitude, or whether there is a system at work here. I believe it to be the latter, because the Member States are simply unwilling to accept these undoubtedly forward-looking rules, but I will also make it abundantly clear that Parliament champions the cause of the Single Sky, one that will guarantee greater safety and also greater efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to list four points that I believe should be regarded as essentials. Firstly, the military cannot be allowed to continue to dominate European airspace. This is about bringing about proper coordination, in which civil and military air operators are partners with equal rights, and with the certainty that they are able to cooperate with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the air, too, the European patchwork must be done away with once and for all. Nobody, after all, can grasp how it is that we still have almost forty blocks of airspace in the skies above fifteen Member States long after land borders have been abolished. The issue of whose decision this should be is of the utmost importance, as the Member States have had enough time over the past decades to take the decision to create cross-border airspace blocks. They failed to do so, and so, I believe, the decision passes to the European level – to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we want air safety services to be cautiously opened up to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth is that we want mandatory harmonisation of both technology and of the training of air traffic controllers, as a means to making both technology and human resources mutually compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">Today marks the first anniversary of the terrible air disaster on Lake Constance. Whilst that has no direct connection with this regulation, it does indicate the potential dangers inherent in a multiplicity of airspace blocks, in which the airlines constantly have to announce their entry and exit, with all the potential for misunderstanding that is involved. What this means is that we have the responsibility of ensuring safety and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">If my judgment is correct, I can only say that my group will not be held responsible for regulations that do not end up giving real competence to the European level, along with the power to implement it. I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission. Commissioner, I am somewhat surprised; you have narrowed the scope to some extent, and your staff were even more cautious, but, otherwise, on many aspects, you have demanded much more, and, if I may mention open skies, where you want all powers granted to you at once, you have suddenly started to hold back on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you to consider on which side you are fighting. Join forces with Parliament, so that we may have a common European sky, in the interests of the people in the countries from which we come.</p>

The public see the Single Sky project as the European response to the situation in the skies above Europe, which is, to say the least, unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do matters stand? We have three times as many control centres as an area of comparable size in the USA, with a patchwork carpet – a product of the Sixties – in the skies above us. If you fly from Brussels to Rome, you have to pass through nine different control sectors; during a flight from Brussels to Geneva, the radio frequency has to be changed five times. With the number of journeys by air continuing to mount over the coming years, the whole thing is more and more a safety hazard, and, at the same time, highly inefficient; one in every four flights is delayed, and 350 000 flying hours are wasted every year. All that costs the airlines some two thousand million euros per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, with its regulatory package, and Parliament, at first reading stage, faced up to this challenge, but the Member States’ Common Position does not do it justice in terms of what is expected and required. Why is this so?</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason for this is that, at the heart of the single sky, there are the functional airspace blocks. How are these to become reality? What is the added value of a regulation if its implementation is to continue to be dependent on the whims of the Member States? They can already set up airspace blocks on a bilateral basis. We take the view that nothing will change here unless we get a normative proposal from Eurocontrol and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, in the Common Position, we have made hardly any real progress away from the status quo in terms of civil/military cooperation either. I know this is a highly sensitive issue, but we cannot wait a few decades more for people to be able to fly within Europe by a direct route from A to B.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is a cause of anguish that there has been no European response to the desperate lack of air traffic controllers. This must be included in the regulatory package and – not least for safety reasons – should be tackled as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My group endorses the reintroduction of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage. No doubt we will have to have frank discussions with the Council in the Conciliation Committee.</p>

I would like at this stage to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and in taking this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with European airspace is congestion. There is an enormous volume of air traffic in Central Europe. Ensuring that it flows well demands cooperation between the Member States, and this has already been achieved. Nevertheless, in sparsely populated Member States, such as Finland, there are not very many problems of this sort. The country’s domestic air traffic, in particular, can be managed very flexibly alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives in the report are ambitious. It has a number of far-reaching proposals. One of them concerns the division of airspace. Dividing up the airspace into sectors could be brought about if necessary through qualified majority decisions. One might wonder whether this is necessary to achieve the objectives or whether cooperation between the Member States would suffice. It may well be that closer integration in the heart of the EU is essential, but there is probably no need for it in the peripheral regions, given their special circumstances. A problem, too, is charges. If air traffic control services were charged based on average values it might well mean that charges would clearly rise in some areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A more delicate problem is the integration of military aviation and air defence with the European system. Traditionally, military matters and questions of defence do not fall within the scope of the codecision procedure, involving the Council and Parliament, in the EU, and there is no justification for that now either. Consequently, in this regard too we should tread carefully and respect agreed principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Even taking these difficulties into consideration, however, the reports are extremely valuable and the objectives they have set their sights on are excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the approach that prevailed in the Council bears the stamp of realism in a number of areas, I regret that it did not attack certain provisions more. I will come back to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement for a separation of functions between service providers and the national monitoring authorities is, like the requirement for certification of service providers, a structuring measure. If it is about affirming the desire to distinguish the role of the operator and that of the regulator and increase transparency, the requirement should take into account the real situations that show that different concepts can also work. In any case, I think it is reasonable for each Member State to retain the choice of how things operate in their countries. I regret that it has not been clearly recognised that the management of air navigation security was part of a chain of actions and services that needed an overall, rather than a divided approach. I am even more convinced of this approach after spending two days last week at the annual conference of the ‘air navigation’ group of the ETF unions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to talk about dividing up, but I think that we also need to talk about the human factor. We can always reduce the staff in control centres, but it is not acceptable for one section of airspace to be managed by only one or two controllers: there are also human limits.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in terms of airspace, progress has been made in that a single European flight information area in the upper airspace has been created and in that the Commission has produced a common publication on aeronautical information in that area; these are established facts. Harmonisation would also be ensured for pricing of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the organisation of airspace and service provision, everyone agrees that safety requires anticipation, research and agreement between States and the service providers concerned. The changes made to the initial text particularly concern recognising the sovereignty of the States over the airspace above them and pointing out the responsibilities of those States towards the ICAO. The Council thus reached the conclusion that the functional blocks of airspace, which have been the subject of many debates, will be established by the States concerned. Is this good or bad? I think that it is a process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of recognising the fact that air control requires that prerogatives of the public powers be exercised and that it should not be of an economic nature justifying the application of the competition rules in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, it is the States that decide whether or not to give financial incentives to their service providers or users through taxes; this is the approach that I, personally, prefer.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, then, is that we recognise the central role that Eurocontrol must play in preparing measures delegated to the Commission, which are part of the responsibilities of that organisation; in my opinion, this is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there is the recognition of the exclusive competence of the States in determining their defence operations, including processing them, which, I agree with you Commissioner, is not desirable. I would lean more towards putting civil before military in peacetime, which is undoubtedly the situation today.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the common position incorporates a large proportion of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading. I regret, nevertheless that the Council, like Parliament at first reading stage, was cautious about certain demands that I regard as sensible. I thus find it regrettable that my group’s proposal to double the control apparatus to ensure that operations continue if there is any failure, and the proposal to evaluate the correct implementation of the Directive, were not retained.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met with the operators and worked a great deal with the unions on this matter. There are those employed in the sector who are already working in the European and world airspace and are determined to move Europe forward, and I think that we should listen to them. Hearing them means really involving them and not only consulting them. Europe will be made using people from different sectors and will require their active participation; I do not think that there is any future without them.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I regret nevertheless that the approach remains focused, on the whole, on the ideological premise that liberalisation brings efficiency, including in terms of safety, something that remains to be seen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first philosophy considers that delayed flights, which are a very extensive phenomenon in Europe, are a serious blow to the airline companies, the passengers themselves, the environment and the economy as a whole. One of the most basic reasons to which this situation is ascribed is the constant increase in air traffic and, more importantly, the lack of a common system for managing the airspace of the European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The other philosophy reflects the concern of certain Member States who would like to secure their airspace rights, mainly in relation to their defence obligations and needs, and the corresponding facility to carry out military exercises in that space. These concerns are more acute where there are problems connected with these issues, in countries such as my own.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has espoused the first philosophy. As in numerous other sectors of European policy, the choice of a real Community policy and uniform regulation have been judged more efficient. This was the philosophy at first reading. The Council, unfortunately, relied solely on the second philosophy. The concerns and doubts prevailed. The Council set particular store by issues of public order, security and defence. In this way, it essentially deadened the Commission's proposal and, of course, its position bears no relation to the position of the European Parliament at first reading. If the Council agreed with the objective of the Single European Sky, it should have adopted a different strategy. Otherwise, it should have said honestly that it disagreed with the endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that we are being drawn into a conciliation procedure. In this procedure, the Council must demonstrate flexibility. I firmly believe that there are ways for us to take essential steps as far as the Single European Sky is concerned, without touching on national sensitivities and vital interests. Where there is a will, there is always a way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that, since then, we have done a lot of work and we are not very far from reaching a balance point. We have recognised that air navigation services are of general and security interest. We have left it up to the Member States to appoint their services. We have brought Eurocontrol into the picture, which I think was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are still some points to deal with. Although I am aware of the legal constraints that they imply, I approve of and encourage the efforts that the Commission is making so that the military authorities at least agree to have a discussion. We are aware that there is an obstacle there, and quite a considerable one, which concerns capacity and is undoubtedly much more significant than others that are too often pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question of arbitration on international airspace blocks has not yet been decided upon. I think that it would be enough for all the parties present to agree to re-establish taking into account Eurocontrol’s assessment; the Commission, as is normal practice, needs to give the final ruling on that assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am of the opinion that we need to implement Recital 16 and Article 7 of Mrs Sanders-ten Holte’s report, which are aimed at involving staff as closely as possible, as they are an integral part of the safety chain. The air navigation profession is not simply about the market – and I think that the Commission can take pride in having finally recognised it – it is first of all about ‘policing’ airspace, airspace which will become increasingly overloaded and in which we must at all costs preserve know-how and excellence, avoiding introducing too much competition into the sky ‘policing’ services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs De Palacio in particular has already emphasised, however, this is a delicate matter in technical, institutional and political terms, and it demands a high degree of realism and common sense. In the speech I delivered here last September, during the debate at first reading on the organisation of the Single European Sky, I had occasion to mention the aspects of the Commission proposals, and also those adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which concerned me most.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only emphasise that my concerns, especially those linked to the functional blocks, evaporated to a large extent when the Council adopted its fairly balanced common position. For the same reason, I feel bound to distance myself once more from some of the amendments adopted for a second time by the Committee on Transport, since they are totally at odds with the consensus reached in the Council, and also with the Commission’s newly reconsidered position, which, of course, I commend.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, I find the insistence on the proposal to create functional blocks, to be imposed regardless of the wishes of the Member States, particularly hard to justify: it does not fall within the Community’s competence to manage airspace, or any other aspect of the EU’s territory. It falls within the Community’s competence least of all when military matters are involved, as in the present case. Besides, no intractable conflicts over the definition of blocks of crossborder airspace are known to have arisen between Member States up to now, and none are predicted. Such conflicts are even less likely now that the Member States have adopted a statement guaranteeing the degree of cooperation required between civilian and military organisations in order fully to implement the flexible use of airspace concept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our standpoint is still that which we took at first reading, and I do not therefore want to respond to the small minority of radicals that has just spoken, but I would like to address the Commissioner in the words of a great German poet: more courage, Commissioner, more courage!</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, we should remind ourselves of how, in the summer of 1999, when discussing your presentation of what you were going to do in office, we made the observation that the question of a unitary system of air traffic control was one example of an effective European policy that produced demonstrable added value. It is because that was the position you took in 1999, and because your proposals were in line with that, that we, like Mr Schmitt, are rather sad that your final comment on the Common Position was that, if that was everything that the Council was going to concede to us, then you were satisfied. So, more courage, Commissioner; we want the second reading to take us down the road your proposals indicated; we want functional airspace blocks!</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Miranda, who spoke just now, and to a number of others who have spoken before me, I have to say that the Member States, and Eurocontrol too, have had forty years in which to carve out the airspace blocks in ways that make sound business sense, and they have never done anything about it. It is for that reason that we – Parliament and the Commission together – must do it by means of well thought-out legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, as we come to the reports’ second reading, let us, who are the majority in Parliament, and the Commission, be more courageous if we are to have a European added value in the skies above Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can support most of their amendments, but I have strong reservations about 10 out of the 51 amendments. The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of the Single European Sky concept. Personally, I wish to see it implemented as soon as possible to eliminate delays, reduce emissions and enhance safety. My primary reservations stem from how to best secure the military's involvement in the Single European Sky. That it why I support the Council's common position – its compromise on the flexible use of airspace where civil access is permitted to designated military airspace when it is not in use.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise solution was arrived at after careful negotiations over many months. I consider that it offers genuine and important benefits by ensuring that the greater effectiveness of the FUA concept is rolled out across the European Union. Amendments that bring the military into the scope of the Single European Sky regulations will clearly be opposed by some Members and, I fear, by many in the Council. Reopening the debate on this issue will clearly be counterproductive to the whole process of the Single European Sky.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, there is a real danger that, by seeking to amend the common position in this regard, we might jeopardise the entire Single European Sky project, something I am sure that we all wish to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council, however, has no need to embellish reality, which is why there are differences in formulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences in formulation, however, hide the reality more than highlighting it. The European Union is an association dominated by rival States that hold on to their borders, even in the sky. What they call their sovereignty is only the civil and military defence of their egotistical interests and those of their wealthy classes. Although the sky is single by nature, it is not yet single for human society, and the European institutions are clearly not managing to put an end to this aberration.</p>
<p class="contents">The expression ‘single sky’, however, is being used to cover up an operation aimed at making further inroads into the public service of air traffic control for the benefit of operators, suppliers and private service providers. That is what it is about. The European authorities have already authorised the privatisation of the British body responsible for air traffic control. Some of the Eurocontrol rules have also been modified to enable private companies to make profits in the air traffic control sector. Air traffic control unions in Europe are rightly condemning this rampant privatisation and its consequences both for the safety of flights and for the staff’s working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, at the time of the Lake Constance air disaster, we saw what tragedies could result from the introduction of the law of profit into this field, even if only to a limited extent. Despite that, and while hypocritically defending themselves, the European authorities are persisting and signing. They are pushing even further towards dismantling this public service, towards the race for profits and cutting the sky up into sectors that can be allocated to private operators. The airlines will undoubtedly do well out of it, but the air traffic control staff and passenger safety will not.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore once again expressing our opposition to this increased privatisation of the sky, which is damaging both to users and to air transport employees in the broad sense, and to the people in the flight path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although my delegation will be supporting a number of the amendments when we vote tomorrow, we will not be supporting those that reopen the debate concerning military operations. Unlike many colleagues, we consider it essential to retain the common position in this area, which now excludes the military dimension and which I understand is supported by the Commission. We will therefore oppose Amendments Nos 6 and 10 and, in addition, Amendment No 18 from the Fava report, which suggests the removal of military training from the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Military training is not covered under the term 'military operations'. It is essential that this be excluded from the scope of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's report, we also oppose Amendment No 25, due to its requirement that all air traffic in the EUIR should be known to air traffic service providers on military grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 29 and 30, the Council's position on the flexible use of airspace, which has been practised in the UK for many years, in my view offered important benefits and greater effectiveness across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On other matters, Amendment No 3 – which refers to the establishment of a reserve – is questionable on the issue of charges as this could create a provision for Member States' subsidies and would not, therefore, be a legitimate measure under Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendments Nos 24 and 31, which concern the automatic move towards a single lower airspace flight information region: placing an automatic requirement on states to put one in place within five years is, quite frankly, premature and unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 21 on functional blocks of airspace, which proposes a centrally-planned top-to-bottom approach: I believe this overlooks local requirements.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I agree entirely with the aims of the proposals under discussion, I do have some concerns about their content, which I feel bound to share with this House. They stem, firstly, from the lack of a legal basis in the common transport policy for legislating in certain areas, especially those involving the military. Furthermore, they are rooted in the excessive and unnecessary curtailing of Member States’ sovereignty over their own airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention three points which I believe are fundamental in this connection. The first relates to what I view as the Commission’s attempt to communitise the Member States’ airspace through the immediate creation of a single European flight region, on the basis of which the so-called ‘functional blocks’ will be established. I give my full support on this point to the Council’s common position, according to which the delineation of the functional blocks falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States and cannot be changed by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, moving on to military matters, the Commission proposals allow for the possibility of subjecting military activities to rules for airspace management and use. Once again, I agree with the Council’s common position, which seems much more suitable and balanced, since it recognises that more efficient use of our airspace does indeed depend on closer cooperation between civilian and military organisations. In other words, the concept known as the ‘flexible use of airspace’ should be uniformly applied throughout the Single European Sky. This objective should always be pursued with due regard for national competences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer to the question of airspace management, and express my total disagreement with any approach seeking to make airspace management out to be just another economic service comparable to the liberalised telecommunications or transport markets supervised by a European regulatory body. I would argue, therefore, that each Member State should be completely free to designate the service provider for its own airspace, under the supervision of national regulatory authorities and without being answerable to any other organisations whatsoever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that in the field of aviation we have been taking giant steps over recent years in terms of creating common areas amongst the Member States of the Union, which until now were the exclusive competence of those States. For example, in the field of air safety, through the European Air Safety Agency, which will allow us for the first time to provide a common certification of aircraft in Europe and which will allow us, amongst other things, to be able to certify the Airbus 380. For example, when we propose new safety standards in the fight against terrorism and other types of attack, which are shared and common for all the States of the Union, with reviews and controls which guarantee that these common standards are applied by everybody. And, for example, when we finally achieve a mandate for negotiation with the United States with regard to a common aviation zone between the United States and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest great initiative is precisely the Single European Sky, which facilitates all the actions I referred to earlier, particularly the negotiation with the United States, and also in the field of safety and the European Air Safety Agency, but which furthermore is going to allow us to ensure in the future that this time Europe is not left behind on this issue; I am referring to the issue of the new definitions and new concepts for the management of air traffic for 2020, where clearly the possibility of having a single sky, within which we will have integrated, harmonised and common systems, means that Europe will have a critical mass with which to negotiate adequately with the United States, which by means of an equivalent initiative is carrying out work in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The STAR 21 initiative is a key initiative for the future. It is key to European air safety and technology, technological development and European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, reference has been made to Eurocontrol. Eurocontrol is taken into account and is going to participate – we have said this since the outset. It has participated in all the meetings we have held on the Single European Sky in the high-level groups and throughout all this time, as a source of knowledge, in its capacity as a group of experts. The Commission does not intend to create an alternative system to Eurocontrol. That is not our job. But we cannot allow the Commission to legislate on the basis of decisions by a body like Eurocontrol, which is in no way a Community body, but which is an intergovernmental body which includes a series of countries which do not belong to the European Union. The honourable Members must understand that there is a fundamental institutional problem which we cannot avoid when it comes to accepting certain types of amendment. It is one thing to employ, contract and even reach agreements with Eurocontrol, so that it may act as an expert to which we refer and which provides us with certain types of information, documents and even proposals, but it is quite another to commit ourselves to legislate or act on the basis of what is said by an intergovernmental organisation containing third countries. We simply cannot do that, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue is Amendment No 4 by Mrs Sanders—ten Holte, with regard to licences for air traffic controllers; of course I have taken it up again. We accept it – I have said this before – for the simple reason that it was in our initial proposal. It was the Council that withdrew it from its common position and the Commission is pleased to reincorporate it because we believe we have to provide common training and qualifications for all air traffic controllers at European level, although there must then be specialisation in the specific area in which they have to operate and work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to liberalisation, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how to say this, because I have said it so many times ... We are not liberalising anything here. Where do we say that this field is going to be dealt with like telecommunications? If you can show me where we say it, I am prepared to correct it, for the simple reason that we have not said it anywhere. If we had, I would be worried, just as the honourable Members are. As one of the speakers said quite rightly a moment ago, there are competences here which belong to the public sector, to police activity, and there clearly cannot be more than two operators because that would create an undesirable situation. There will therefore be neither liberalisation nor competition. It is different when it comes to using certain services such as, for example, weather forecasts, when it will be possible to refer to the national meteorological centre of the country in question or the meteorological centre of another State or whoever provides the most suitable data. That is another issue. But when it comes to traffic and air control, none of this is being proposed: neither liberalisation, which makes no sense, nor privatisation. By the way, it is true that one State has carried out privatisation unilaterally, in a very particular manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by referring to the two problems which I believe will be the crux of the debate in conciliation. Mr Jarzembowski asked me to be courageous and some people have said that in the end we in the Commission have been timid. Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are well aware that this issue has been promoted from the outset with all the necessary courage, strength and rigour on the part of the Commission. But we are talking about a question of possibilities, realities and urgent issues in a complicated area in relation to which we are all aware that the first pillar is one thing and that defence aspects are quite another, since we have no capacity to intervene in them. I believe that the Council's compromise – and some of the honourable Members have said this – with regard to flexibility in terms of civil and military use, is a very acceptable compromise. It is very possible that in the future this compromise and this formulation will evolve. I am sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, but this is the first step. Let us remember that we are moving forward, that this is the first step and that a change is taking place which I would go as far as to say is almost revolutionary. I would therefore ask the honourable Members not to approve the amendments which mean changing the Council's compromise on the civil and military use of airspace. It is a very delicate compromise and to break it would create serious problems, as Mr Watts said a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the functional blocks, I understand what the honourable Members are saying. I believe that the two problems can be combined here: the guarantee to the States that they will preserve their competences and capacities, with the concern for the coherence of the whole global concept. I believe that if the Council shows itself to be flexible there is a margin within which we could work. It is clearly the States which must reach agreement, but by means of the group which is working with the Commission, coherence will be given to the whole issue and all the blocks proposed. In this regard, some of your amendments perhaps facilitate this approach and I hope that in this way we can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders—ten Holte, once again for their work, and all the honourable Members for their speeches, and to ask you, in terms of flexibility, not to go further than the Council’s compromise, because I know that there is no room for manoeuvre there. That would endanger the whole agreement, which is very fragile, as the honourable Members are well aware, on an initiative which is absolutely necessary and urgent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
