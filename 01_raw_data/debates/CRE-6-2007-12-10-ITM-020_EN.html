The Treaty of Rome established the collective principle of free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In terms of people, we have put a great deal of emphasis on health and safety issues in the workplace and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, whilst the mobility of business and workers, along with tourism, is vital to our economic well-being and the fulfilment of the Lisbon competition agenda, we cannot do a simple thing like guaranteeing that European citizens, whether as consumers or workers, are equally safe from the dangers of fire when they stay or work in hotels across the Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has competence for health and safety. We limit lawnmower noise but not the prospect of being burnt to death. Consumer protection means that we are concerned about the safety of lifts and escalators but not the safety of hotels. The Commissioner has just said that all our actions are proportional. I wonder if she considers that it is proportional that no action has been taken with respect to safety in hotels.</p>
<p class="contents">Fire-sprinkler systems are highly effective, extinguishing or controlling 99% of fires at the earliest stage. No one has, reportedly, ever died in a fully-sprinkled hotel in the EU. However, since 2003 alone, over 60 people in the Union have died in fires in hotels where no sprinklers were fitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Tragically, three of these were in my own constituency over the summer in the Penhallow Hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, where a fire got out of hand because there were no sprinklers. One of the people who died was a disabled woman who was unable to make her way out of the building unaided. What is the Commission doing to protect people like her?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will claim subsidiarity. Get real! How many people have died in the EU from lawnmower noise or from lift or escalator accidents since 2003? Yet the Commission has seen fit to take away Member State autonomy with regard to these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Fire regulations with regard to sprinkler provision vary widely across the EU, with Hungary probably having the best, and France, which has the highest recent death rate, having none at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Some more enlightened European hotel chains, such as the Accor Group, are now adopting the sprinkling of new hotels, following in the footsteps of the American brands Hilton, Marriott and Sheraton.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not good enough to leave it to self-regulation. At least one federal state is not prepared to excuse inaction by talking about subsidiarity. In the US, all new hotels are sprinkler-protected by law. Indeed, federal employees cannot claim expenses unless they stay in sprinkled hotels when on business trips.</p>
<p class="contents">We, therefore, call on the Commission to look into the introduction of a directive laying down minimum provision in all Member States that mandates that all new hotels over 20 beds should be fully sprinkled and that existing hotels over 20 beds should at least, have corridors and exit routes sprinkler-protected. That would not be a huge economic burden: it would cost less than an additional 2%. Of course, existing hotels should be given adequate time to comply, but what we want is to act now and not wait until we are forced into action by the public following a major tragedy when hundreds die. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Research estimates that the number of fatalities per million inhabitants per year is 10.8 in the UK, 6 in Spain, 11.8 in France, 15.7 in Sweden and 7.3 in Germany. So, as Commissioner for Consumer Protection, this is a matter of major concern for me. Thank you for remembering this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall the tragic case involving a British family whose two children were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in a hotel room in Corfu in October 2006. I have received several letters from you about this case. We contacted the Greek authorities and they informed us that the hotel where the accident happened had its licence immediately revoked and has not been operating since then. I know that legal proceedings are taking place in Greece and I hope they will come to a clear conclusion very soon. This is an emblematic case, but unfortunately this is not the only one.</p>
<p class="contents">Fire safety in hotels has been at the centre of discussions with the Member States for the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the results that have been achieved so far. Council Recommendation 86/666/EC on fire safety in existing hotels has helped to improve safety levels, especially in those countries where no or scarce regulation was available.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Construction Products Directive sets up specific requirements in the event of an outbreak of fire for all construction works, including hotels. Several measures have been adopted to ensure a consistent application of this directive in the Member States, such as a common system for classifying fire resistance of construction products and a number of harmonised European standards in the fields of fire-fighting, alarm and alerting equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the requirements of the Council recommendation addressing the risks linked to electrical lighting have been implemented by the Low Voltage Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still a lot of ground to cover in making all hotels in Europe equally safe, whether existing or new and regardless of their size and accommodation facilities. As we know, the requirements are for the hotels that have at least 20 rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">In its various discussions with the Member States, the Commission has noted that no common way forward for an EU-wide action has yet been agreed upon and that the proper enforcement of national legislation is, so far, the main priority. This issue of compliance is indeed a problem that should not be underestimated, and I am really sad to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I have asked the major hotel chains present in Europe to come to Brussels for a meeting with me on 8 February 2008. Obviously, until we have this legislation in place, we should take our immediate action. We will discuss the hotel safety issue and I will report back to you on the results of this consultation. If we can do it together with Parliament – if Parliament would like to participate in this meeting on 8 February – I will be more than glad to have this meeting with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The collection of EU-wide data and statistics is a critical point: absence of statistical definitions and homogeneity in the way fire accidents are registered in the Member States makes comparability a very difficult and inaccurate exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to move on to the point of standardisation. Standardisation without the support of a legal framework, such as a European directive or even a revised recommendation, would severely reduce its impact, and the ultimate objective of ensuring fire safety in hotels would be frustrated as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the issue of sprinklers: their efficiency in reducing the devastating effect of fires has been largely demonstrated, but the cost of their installation and maintenance is not always compatible with the type of hotels that are mostly present in Europe, such as small, family-type hotels.</p>
<p class="contents">Next to this, the decision of whether sprinklers or any other fire-fighting device should be compulsory in hotels falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States. I would be glad to discuss with the Member States and to support such measures if they are ready to take such steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to these developments on the regulatory side, it should be mentioned that hotels are adopting self-regulating performance-based codes and design methods. I think that hotel chains such as Accor should be really supported in their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not only dealing with fire safety in hotels under its profile as a service, but is also targeting, in a comprehensive strategy against fire risk, all those products that are largely present in hotels and most likely to be either the source of a fire or its accelerant. The initiatives of RIP cigarettes, on which the chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Ms McCarthy, gave us a very important contribution, flammability of upholstered furniture, and nightwear and child-resistant lighters are the pillars of such a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to continuing our cooperation on this very important issue which is a major concern for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once more again to thank Parliament and especially the President because we are taking concrete measures with what is in our hands right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He wants me to associate him very much with the thrust of the question that Mr Ford has tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">From my own side it is rather poignant also, because the issues about fires are, of course, not just confined to hotels. A few weeks ago, in the heart of my own constituency in Warwickshire, there was a truly dreadful fire in an industrial building, in which four volunteer firemen tragically lost their lives. We have not had the full results of the inquiry on that tragic incident yet, but it is clear that the building was supposed to have a sprinkler system but apparently did not have one fitted. So I want to draw attention of colleagues to that tonight, in perhaps just thinking about some of the broader issues that the Commissioner has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner quite rightly pointed to the fact that in the Construction Products Directive, which will be coming to our committee early next year, issues about building flammability and construction materials are dealt with and I think will be looked at again. And, of course, the whole issue of building standards and the potential for fire prevention devices like sprinklers is opened up by Mr Ford’s question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am perhaps more sympathetic to the Commissioner’s position, as I think one has to be careful about trying to impose a very expensive single solution, particularly in the hotel sector, where we have such an enormous range of facilities in size and scale on offer.</p>
<p class="contents">But it does seem to me that something needs to move forward on this and I am delighted to hear that the Commissioner, with her characteristic initiative that we have just heard in the previous debate, is already moving on this and inviting some of the major hotel chains to meet her. But it seems to me that one of the ways in which we can move this forward very quickly is by giving consumers more information in a consistently presented way and heightening their awareness of it. So when they make bookings for hotels, they may look on the internet – and hotels now increasingly do provide fire-protection information, but I think that varies considerably from country to country. So, maybe, having some sort of rating system for hotels, based on their inspections and equipment – a star rating system if you like, which is applied consistently – is something that would be worthwhile raising and considering with the hotel proprietors.</p>
<p class="contents">It operates in a number of other areas: for example, in motor vehicles, where the Commission has successfully promoted an initiative to have a star rating for cars. Perhaps we could consider something to move quickly on this, to deal with the problem that Mr Ford has raised and which this motion places before the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the Commissioner’s willingness to look seriously at how we can improve the situation for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a serious consumer-protection gap on the provision of services. If a consumer travelling on business or on holiday in the EU books a hotel, can he or she be sure that safety measures are in place to prevent fire or the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning or, indeed, whether the swimming pool is safe for children to swim in?</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, as we have seen with toys and products, we are prepared to protect our consumers. When they are accessing or purchasing a service in the internal market, consumer protection does not seem to be there in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet many consumers assume that, when they stay in a hotel, there are adequate and very basic safety standards there. And, of course, as we have seen, they are inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe it is rocket science to install fire sprinklers or carbon monoxide detectors. I think fires and deaths are preventable if the right standards and systems are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I think it is too late – and not good enough – to revoke a licence after children have died, when in fact they should never have had the licence in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to help the Commissioner take action to drive up standards, to cut fire risks and deaths and protect the consumer, so yes, let us think about how we can best achieve this. Mr Harbour’s proposal around an EU rating system is certainly something we may want to look at, but that is something, I believe, that the consumer needs to have easy access to, and I believe the tour operators’ hotel systems should actually put that out for the consumer, so I can then decide I do not wish to go to the hotel or the villa that does not have a safe swimming pool, does not have fire sprinklers or does not have carbon monoxide detectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we can do better for our citizens: we can prevent deaths. I think tonight we have launched the debate, but I do believe – and I think it can be seen from the interventions – that it is the beginning of a campaign for safer services, for the very basic minimum standards to be protected, and I hope that we can make further progress in this area in the not too distant future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that effective fire safety measures cannot be implemented easily at European level because building regulations are administered very unevenly across the Member States and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this problem can be solved only if there are binding specifications for compliance with fire safety standards. This will be effective only if there are compulsory, routine checks, which should logically involve the uniform system of quality standard assessments already called for in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, of course, that technical measures always involve a financial cost. This can be a very great and often insurmountable financial burden for small and medium-sized hotels. In these circumstances the Member States should support fire safety measures by providing aid so that guests can be guaranteed the best possible safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to make one final comment: I do not believe that in the majority of hotels in Europe, which are all small and medium-sized hotels, the solution can lie in negotiating with the industrial complex, therefore the large conglomerates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that the Commissioner recognises that hotel safety goes beyond fire safety. I think the kind of solution that Ms McCarthy suggested in the long term is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be looking at improvements to safety of services but in the short term I hope that at the meeting with hotel owners in February, which I am very pleased about, the Commissioner can raise with them the issue of carbon monoxide safety. Here it is not a question of huge financial layout for hotel chains because you can go on the internet and find that the safest carbon monoxide detector costs GBP 36 in the UK, which is not a lot of money even for the smallest hotel or the smallest company owning caravans. So I think that we should be asking companies to put these safety measures in place now and not wait for several years until there is some EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Families cannot go on holidays expecting not to bring their children home, any more than they can buy Christmas presents for their children expecting them to do damage to them. So I really hope that the Commissioner will raise this issue with the hotel chains and report back to Parliament on this very important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a secret; we have told you that this meeting is very much provoked by our conversation and by the very sad loss of two children.</p>
<p class="contents">How to make this legislation obligatory is part of the possible way of thinking, but we should really look very carefully at the discussion in the Council and see what the opinion of the Member States is, and to make a good balance between what some of the Member States are already doing – they are some way ahead – and what they are ready to do at the level of obligatory measures taken by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that we need to address the safety of services and, more than convinced, I included this in the strategy for consumer protection 2007-2013. The 21st century is not a manufacturing one. The 21st century, I believe, will be much more the century of services, which is why I am convinced that these issues should be addressed through the concept of the safety of services, focusing on where we need to legislate to do this and where we need to rely more on self-regulation – which could very usefully be stepped up – to do our best and to cooperate very closely with Member States, which, in the end, will provide support, if this legislation is approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
