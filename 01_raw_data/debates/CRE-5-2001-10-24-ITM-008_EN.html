It has become clear to us, however, and we have become more conscious of the fact that we need a new definition of security, that the old concepts of security policy actually no longer work and that, for this reason, a particular combination of external and internal security needs to be formed. It is no longer the case, you see, that a potential enemy can be unambiguously recognised behind a border; now the enemy also has the ability to be in our midst. Here, I believe, a coordinated approach needs to be agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, we also know that this threat can no longer be fought by individual states because the challenge is international and runs across borders. That is why we also need to find cross-border solutions. Each individual European state only has a chance of guaranteeing the long-term peace and security of its own people if we pool our resources, in terms of military forces, in the field of prevention and in the field of civil crisis management, but also in terms of ensuring cooperation between our security bodies and intelligence services.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe, we have actually made considerable progress in the last two years in view of the decisions made since the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, in particular, those made at Cologne and subsequent summits. On this basis, I think that we should press on with developing a European security and defence policy once the necessary conditions for doing so are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we have to recognise that it will be necessary to make certain structural changes to achieve this. This is because we believe that it will only work if, firstly, the Member States realise that only the joint institutions can act and that bilateral initiatives also weaken the individuals concerned, even if they think that it makes them appear particularly powerful in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the structures in the different institutions will also have to dovetail to avoid there being any duplication of work. It does not, in my opinion, make any sense for there to be committees on civil crisis management in both the Commission and the Council, with the High Representative. That is why I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to repeat our position that in the long term the duties of the Commissioner for External Relations and those of the High Representative should be merged within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That should happen in order to ensure that there really is a uniform approach and so as to have uniform structures. This has nothing to do with the merits of those specifically involved at the moment; it is a question of structure. On this basis we must also, of course, make sure that this person has special relations with the Council so as to give their work the appropriate legitimacy at that level.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think, however, that we can make it clear that added value really is being generated. I should like to give just a few examples here. I believe, for example, that the large anti-terrorism coalition would not have been formed in this way had it not been for the particular European influence exerted by the troika's travelling to the Middle East, which yielded significant results. I do not believe that the large anti-terrorism coalition will be able to exist in the long term if the European Union does not foster stability in the Mediterranean area through the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I also believe that the European Union has the task of addressing the root causes which sow the emotional seeds of terrorism, whether it be in the Middle East, in the relations between Pakistan and India, or in other parts of the world where we should make a particular effort to make our contribution to securing peace. In this process we have to recognise that our relations with the United States take the form of a partnership and that, regardless of all our efforts to develop our own security and defence policy, NATO is still necessary because it alone is able to guarantee the collective security.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to play a role in politics as a whole, however, we must also actively work to further develop our relations with Russia, build new bridges and provide those countries which at present cannot, should not or do not wish to be members of the European Union with a new framework and a new form of European economic area.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should also like to say that all of this will only work if we are also prepared to make the money available in our national budgets to make it possible to really keep our pledge to provide 60 000 people for the Rapid Reaction Force. We will not be successful in terms of prevention and civil crisis management and we will not continue to play a key role in foreign policy, but will just be passive observers, including in our relations with Russia and the United States of America, if we do not plausibly demonstrate that we have our own military capability. It is often the case that prevention only works if it is possible to show the country in which you want to intervene to establish peace that you also have military options. It is often sufficient to possess a military capability – this is shown throughout history – to prevent military resources from even having to be deployed. That is why realising our vision of having a 60 000-strong Rapid Reaction Force, transport capabilities and our own satellite system by 2003 is decisive for the credibility of the future European foreign and security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, the report is most timely, because, with regard to all issues concerning foreign policy as a whole, in other words, the Union’s policy towards the rest of the world, security policy in all its aspects and defence policy, the European Parliament is clearly in a state of change. I was present in this House for the discussion of the Treaty of Amsterdam, when we stated our disappointment at the little progress made on common security and defence policy. Looking at the point we have reached today, we see that we have come a long way and especially that we have progressed very quickly. The events of recent months and weeks have shown, whatever may have been said about them this morning, that the European Union is becoming, and is being perceived to be, an increasingly important player on the world stage. This gives us both greater visibility and, of course, imposes greater responsibilities on us. I am sure I am not the only person here to have been confronted over the last few weeks with the question: ‘but where are the European Union’s troops?’ asked by people who have completely forgotten that we are not involved and are far from being involved. This means quite simply that we are increasingly perceived to be a player on the global stage and that we must have all the institutional, financial and other means available if we are to successfully achieve all of these responsibilities. This result could clearly only have been achieved as a result of the energy and dynamism both of the High Representative for Security and Cooperation and of Commissioner Patten, who, in a spirit of perfect cooperation, both manage to represent us superbly on all world stages, in all crisis hot-spots on our own continent and in much more far-flung parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Member States of the European Union, are also increasingly managing – and the Belgian presidency has played a part in this – to speak with one voice in international bodies and I am thinking in particular of the United Nations, which currently play an extremely important role. We therefore wish to see ourselves become a major political player on the international stage. This will enable us to better shoulder our responsibilities so that we can contribute to peace and stability across the world. This policy is progressing at the pace we had envisaged. I am sure you know that this is an open process, in which the Fifteen want to involve the candidate countries and the allied non-Member States of the European Union. Negotiations currently taking place with NATO are due to establish the methods of cooperation between ourselves and the Alliance, in order to ensure access to NATO’s resources and capacities and in order to avoid efforts being pointlessly duplicated. As you know, these negotiations are not straightforward and you also know why they are so complex. Ultimately, however, you also know – and I repeat what the presidency has already stated on previous occasions – that we have no intention of allowing this process of establishing the means to guarantee our being operational becoming hostage to events within NATO. We shall lead the way and we shall continue to work to achieve the objectives I have mentioned. I fully agree that conflict prevention and crisis management are amongst the foremost priorities of our action, and, as Mr Brok has said, these priorities must lead us to be committed at every stage. We shall maintain this commitment on a long-term basis in various crisis situations, whether it be in the Balkans, the Middle East or in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which has its origins in the terrible attacks on 11 September in the United States has shown that the European Union is capable of reacting in a rapid and coherent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reaction bore witness to horizontal coordination and has, in fact, transcended the pillar division. I believe that that too is, and will be, an important element in the further development of our common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the European Council has rarely been so outspoken over the past few weeks as it was in that context. We have decided to adopt a voluntaristic policy vis-à-vis the Arab-Muslim world and we are united with many to give out the same message, namely that the crisis that has broken out and the fight against international terrorism can in no way be considered a war between civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, we were reminded of the importance of resuming the peace process in the Middle East. You know that the presidency will be making a visit to that region shortly in the hope of giving out that message and of receiving backing for this.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already stated, our campaign in the Middle East is still based on the implementation of the roadmap, as can be found in the recommendation of the Mitchell committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>With regard to the Western Balkans, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to the systematic implementation of the conclusions of the Zagreb Summit. Cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia is one factor allowing progress to be made on negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with every country that participated in this summit, of which the transfer of Mr Milosevic to The Hague was the most striking symbol, although not the only one. We welcome the progress made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since its return to democracy a little more than a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Kosovo, we are focussing our action on the preparations for the general elections of 17 November, and we are delighted to see that more than 170 000 Serbs have enrolled on the electoral registers, which provides hope that the result may be a balanced one. The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unfortunately not so straightforward and, here also, it has taken all the efforts of our representative, Mr Solana, of Commissioner Patten, and many others, to prevent the crisis that took place there from unfolding into a true civil war. As you know, the situation remains extremely delicate and Mrs Pack even drew my attention to the matter when I reported on the General Affairs Council decisions of 8 October. We are all aware of this and we are monitoring the situation, as you and many others are, extremely closely. I should nevertheless like to emphasise that events in Macedonia have shown that close cooperation between NATO and ourselves is possible and that we are able to play a role in the prevention and management of crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For without peace, the reconstruction of Africa is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I finally draw your attention to the meeting of the European-African Ministerial Conference of 11 October?

<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to our strategic partnerships, I should like to emphasise that our relations with Russia have also been given a new boost at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Little by little, we are seeing the establishment, not so much of mechanisms but of forms of contact and dialogue, which enable us to envisage genuine cooperation and a genuine strategic partnership. This development can only contribute to the stability not only of our own continent, but also to stability throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, state quite clearly on this subject, that this rapprochement between the European Union and Russia, in no way means that we will be any the less vigilant over the situation in Chechnya. We are continuing to discuss the matter and to insist on the need to find a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to mention the Fourth EU-China Summit, which also enabled us to strengthen political dialogue but, once again, this political dialogue includes the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have limited speaking time and the fire drill did not, of course, help and for this I apologise. Out of all that has been said, however, I should like to take up, in conclusion, the three following aspects: a strong Europe, a Europe that is able to project its influence onto the international stage is, above all, a Europe in which internal cohesion supports external action; secondly, it is a Europe in which the synergies between Presidency, Member States, Commission and High Representatives are exploited to the full and, lastly, it is a Europe in which action, whether it be in the field of justice, defence, cooperation or anything else, matches the rhetoric.</p>

The fire drill has meant that this important debate is in a sense an inadvertent victim of the importance of enhancing our parliamentary security. I will unfortunately have to leave shortly because the minister and I have to get to Bucharest by dawn – a challenging journey at this time of evening from Strasbourg! We have to be there for the opening of the Stability Pact conference tomorrow, which, and it is not entirely irrelevant to what the honourable Member says in his report, at least indicates a measure of success over the last couple of years for the evolving common, foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the honourable Member, on what is a very comprehensive and valuable report. As he said in his own remarks, the evolution of a common foreign and security policy is shown to be even more timely by the appalling events of the autumn of 2001. The honourable Member's report gives a very accurate overview of what has been achieved so far. I particularly welcome his proposals for a strong parliamentary dimension in the common foreign and security policy. It is very important that we put down deeper democratic roots for the common foreign and security policy and that should involve not only this distinguished Parliament but also national parliaments. I have made a point of trying to appear in front of the select committees in national parliaments on bilateral visits to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If anybody challenges the progress that we have made in developing a CFSP they should compare what happened during this crisis with what happened in the run-up to the Gulf War at the beginning of the 1990s or how we coped with the Balkans in the early to mid-1990s. We cannot yet, as pop singers would perhaps suggest, 'strut our stuff'. But we have some reason for being modestly proud of the achievements that have been made so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the report's analysis of the prerequisites of successful CFSP action. We have to bring together the resources and instruments of all the EU players: the Community, the Council and the Member States. I doubt whether history will regard the present institutional structures as ideal. I do not put it any more strongly than that, but the High Representative and I have worked as hard as we could make these structures work as effectively as is possible. What will happen in the future is for other people greater than me to determine.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go through all my agreement with the honourable Member on individual regional and geographical areas, not least because Bucharest calls. But I want to stress one or two points he made. I could, for example, have gone into a detailed paragraph or two agreeing on Russia and the Ukraine, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on the Balkans in general and on the importance of getting back to Mitchell in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The two points I should like to mention briefly are these: firstly, we rightly talk about the importance of trying to ensure that the international campaign against terrorism is not seen as a conflict between the West – Europe and North America – and the world of Islam. It is absolutely right that we have to make it clear this is not a clash of civilisations. But we have a real opportunity and responsibility in the European Union to use the mechanisms of the Barcelona process, to use the mechanisms of the Euro-Med partnership in order to strengthen the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world. We have a real chance and a real responsibility to do this. I hope we will seize it. I also hope we will look very hard at our relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point that I want to pick up from Mr Brok's remarks and from the report is simply this: in my judgment, we have to try to ensure that we can make use of this crisis to open doors and windows which have otherwise been shut. That affects, for example, our future relationship with Pakistan. It also, in my judgment, very clearly touches on our relationship with Iran. I have no doubt at all that the Iranians are serious in wanting to establish a better, more profound relationship between themselves and the European Union. I have no doubt at all that they are serious about wanting to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement with us. They know perfectly well that any arrangements with us will involve a dialogue on human rights and related matters. But I believe they are serious interlocutors and that it is incumbent upon us to respond as positively as possible to the overtures they have made.</p>
<p class="contents">On Afghanistan I will only say that I look forward – I hope sooner, rather than later – to the time when I will have to come back to Parliament and the Council and point out the financial consequences for all of us of the political promises and pledges we have made about the future of Afghanistan. There will be an important moment when we have to put our money and our diplomatic efforts where our convictions have been and should remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say once again how important it is to mobilise all our institutions, all our competences, as effectively as possible in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy. Sometimes it is possible to underestimate the contribution which the Commission can make and wants to make in the CFSP field. There is a great deal that we can do in order to make sure that the CFSP develops effectively as a way of reflecting Europe's growing clout in the international political arena. The rapporteur has been well ahead of his time in pressing us to do more in this field. I hope that we will live up to his expectations in the months and years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that the European Community, making a virtue out of necessity, has, thanks to the determination of the Commission, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative, seen its visibility increased since the attacks on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, during the debate on the European Council in Ghent, the President-in-Office of the Council fairly diplomatically said that an awkward situation had arisen as a result of the tripartite meeting that had taken place outside the summit. To a certain extent, Mr President, it is logical that in times of crisis each person tries to save their own skin, but, in my opinion, it is important not to give way to the temptation to act unilaterally, or, to be more precise, on this particular occasion, trilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is strong when united, but when fragmented is weak. For this reason it is important that Europe should be able to speak with one single voice. And the European Union, in the aftermath of the situation that has arisen as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has to rethink its common foreign and security policy, including within it the fight against terrorism, speeding up the achievement of its objectives and making the common strategies mechanism more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, unilateralism, including that of the most prosperous and powerful countries, as we have already witnessed, is nothing but a pipe dream. In the globalised world we are living in today, politics, diplomacy, security and defence are interrelated concepts that have to respond to the new threats we are having to face. Security becomes a universal idea that cannot be split up, far removed from the traditional concepts of state and status quo. In turn, defence is constantly changing its boundaries in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred: nowadays, we cannot only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another, but rather, as has been correctly said, we have armies that lack clear enemies and enemies that lack armies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this world of globalisation, not only economic, but where terror, politics, diplomacy, trade, aid to development, security and defence are all interrelated concepts, it will depend on us to be capable of understanding and accepting that dangers and conflicts affect us all in the same measure and the response to these will also have to be the same for all those concerned. But we will have to start – and I am convinced of this – by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient, coherent and visible, as Mr Brok’s report recommends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us, 'common' means above all, and I am saying this deliberately now, that we must not have, or even give the impression of having, a board of directors issuing instructions and determining policy. 'Common' also means, and here I would support my colleague, Mr Brok, that the High Representative's duties need to be combined with those of the relevant Commissioner. 'Common' also means ensuring that we have a European Union Rapid Reaction Force as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy has to be European to the extent that it clearly defines European objectives, and this means that we show solidarity with the United States of America but also insist that this solidarity is not a one-way street. If I have to read at a time like this that the United States of America is still rejecting the International Criminal Court and that Congress is even debating whether or not those who cooperate with the Criminal Court should be penalised, then this is not what I understand by developing a policy based on solidarity between the European Union and the United States. Solidarity with the United States must therefore also mean our drawing the United States' attention to those areas where it is necessary to pursue a common policy in the world community.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that if we form alliances, in particular this alliance against terrorism, an alliance which we must and should form, we will more often find ourselves facing a contradiction or conflict between our strategic concerns on the one hand and our human rights concerns on the other. We should be under no illusion about this. Anyone who wishes to enter into an alliance, and I do, with the Soviet Union, with Russia, with China and with the Islamic States, will repeatedly encounter this contradiction. We should simply realise that we also need to make it absolutely clear to the public that this contradiction exists. We need to work towards both objectives. We should never abandon our aim of securing respect for human rights in the medium and long term when we have to form a strategic alliance, because if you support the shahs of today you will get the Ayatollah Khomeinis of tomorrow. This can happen if we do not remain vigilant and at the same time put the issue of human rights at the centre of our foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we do not agree with the fundamental aspects of his report and, for this reason, we cannot support it with our vote. As an example, I will now briefly mention three of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, 11 September was an opportune moment for the European Union to demonstrate that it could play a positive, peaceful and reflective role with the United States, in order to find, in the International Criminal Tribunal and through International Law, a solution to the conflict. What appeared to be taking place in this direction has now been frustrated by the emergence of the Schröder – Blair – Chirac triumvirate which has missed this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report gives great importance to NATO, when we think that NATO works against the interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is very important that the European Union should play a role in the Middle East and in the Western Sahara, and we are also wasting this opportunity. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This task allocation allows me to draw the Council’s and Commission’s attention to the security situation in the Western Balkans and the Indonesian Archipelago. Further to a recently published scientific analysis of the question whether Bosnia might function as European base for Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network, I should like to find out from the Council and Commission whether they have any concrete indications that Bin Laden followers are indeed active in the Western section of the Balkans and if so, how the EU and its Member States, obviously in close cooperation with the US, intend to stand up to this dangerous destabilisation of that region. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Brok report calls for a continuation of the political dialogue with Indonesia. I expect the Council and Commission to constantly monitor the security situation on the Moluccas where Bin Laden followers are also conducting a jihad against indigenous Christians. </p>

However, at a time such as this, it is important for the European Union to show itself to be as, and more, united than before and as, and more, capable than before of reacting with one voice. At a time such as this, when all our worst fears are unexpectedly realised, we realise the importance of this Europe that we are integrating, the importance of being united and having coordinating structures able to operate in real time, of being able to think and act all together and in respect for all the positions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that we still have a long way to go: the common foreign and security policy is not yet operative and there are still complex issues to be ironed out in its operating mechanism, particularly in the area of national sovereignties, but we now need, more than ever before, to speed up our work. I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area, particularly with regard to what – as we have been witnessing in recent months – will be the real challenge of the new millennium: preventing conflicts, finding a non-military solution to the crisis and, most importantly, combating terrorism. You see, the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy, of making our foreign policy practical reality, the more successful Europe’s internal politics will be. Quite frankly, the acceleration of the euro, acceleration on the economic side of things, has not been matched by acceleration on the political front. Well then, there must be acceleration in political matters, and the foreign policy is crucial if that is to happen, particularly at this time. If we do this, we will achieve a stronger, more resilient Europe and a stronger euro, and we will certainly be able to take a better approach to enlargement and, moreover, to compete on equal terms with the dollar and NAFTA – Canada, the United States and Mexico – the Agreement as it stands, a market which already exists and already presents important political points of reference. We must act and we must be fully confident in what we are doing: the foreign policy will become vital in the short-term future, especially for the new generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not be under any illusion: if this were to happen, it would never be in a ‘clean’ war. No one is in a better position than a soldier to know that a war will always be ‘dirty’ and that, despite advances in technology, mankind will never be able to kill off all evil people just by pressing a button if only because it will find it impossible to tell the good from the bad with any degree of certainty. War will always be dirty and will always be an evil, but it could be ‘the lesser of two evils’, if it is only embarked upon in the aim of achieving a political objective that cannot be achieved through any other means. To quote Clausewitz, ‘War is only the continuation of politics by other means.’ It must, therefore, be ended as soon as its political objective is achieved and must not be embarked upon if there is no chance of achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the objective of the war we have just embarked upon in Afghanistan? Everyone can see that it is to enable the Afghan people to rid themselves of a regime that has proved its barbarity. This seems today to be not only desirable, but also possible. We are sensitive to the suffering that this war is inflicting on the population and hope, therefore, that this objective is achieved as quickly as possible. We must therefore understand that a halt to hostilities, even a temporary one, would only strengthen the position of the Taliban. Let us show ourselves to be capable, having learned from the unfortunate experience of the Gulf war, of seeing it through to the end, in other words, to the establishment in Kabul of a regime that is acceptable to all Afghans. Let us show that we are capable of ensuring that country’s gradual return to peace and stability. To this end, many of us hope that the European Union will give its support to the negotiations currently taking place under the auspices of the United Nations, between the former king, Zaher Shah and the opposition’s representative. I would have liked to hear the personal opinion of Commissioner Patten on this matter. I realise that he is not present to be able to give an answer, and so I ask you, Mr Lamy, whether you would be good enough to give us your personal reaction to this idea.

He is right to say that the coalition against terror would not have been possible without the progress we have made within the EU to bring about that unity and coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly a lot still needs to be done, and we have to take advantage of the current crisis to perhaps change the emphasis in our work. We spend something like 60% of what the Americans spend on defence, but we spend 400% of what the Americans spend on what might be called ‘soft intervention’ – humanitarian aid and assistance. We need to try to change that emphasis. The Americans need to learn from this crisis that security is not just a matter of power projection. You can have all the weapons in the world, but you will be unable to defend yourself against a few people armed with box cutters. We need to have a multinational approach to the global problems.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part we have to realise that we must have greater military capability in order to back up our actions. That is why the capability process currently under way is so important. We must put some teeth into our common foreign and security policy. That is why I am disappointed with the news that Italy is likely to pull out of the project for A400M aircraft. We need strategic lift. It is often ironic that the countries that most engage in rhetoric about European cooperation are those that often fail to produce the action.</p>
<p class="contents">One final observation is that at the moment we are seeing a warming of relations with Iran and Syria. I should like to remind colleagues that there are a number of Israeli soldiers and civilians held hostage by forces sympathetic to, or controlled by, Iran and Syria. These people are missing in action and I would hope the Commission and the Council would use this opportunity to get those hostages restored to their families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is a good one, but it still fails to take the full measure of the profound change which has taken place in international politics following 11 September. We are still unable to grasp the full ramifications of this change; but we know that it is a very profound one. The representatives from the United States have stated that a second Cold War has begun, and some have even talked of a third World War. Here, in Europe, we have been wary of excessive dramatisation and have avoided using the word ‘war’. My personal view, however, is that, in time, history books will come to refer to this period as the Third World War.</p>
<p class="contents">We must very carefully analyse what has happened and what is currently happening, and very prudently come to grips with those problems which are now facing us. We need a broad global perspective and grasp; we need something which, in English, can be called 'global governance'<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the matter which I intended to mention in my own intervention. The progress achieved in the common foreign and security policy during the last few years has been based on the Treaty of Amsterdam. Rapid advances have been made, particularly in crisis management. In the Treaty of Amsterdam we also took as our joint task the safeguarding of the Union's integrity and the maintenance of peace on its external frontiers. Up to now, no definite content has been given to these new treaty obligations. In the initial phase at any rate, the main question is probably this: how are the different geographical positions of the various Member States to be taken into account in sharing the burden and dividing the work among them? From the point of view of the Union as a whole it may make sense for those Member States situated on its common external frontiers to direct their resources to the control and defence of these borders, and for them to take part in crisis management in a way which is in harmony with this primary task. I hope that debate will be initiated within the Commission and the Council on the practical implications of the provisions of the Treaty concerning the integrity of the Union and the safeguarding of its frontiers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and, as a consequence, undermine the EU's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage. Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States. Our mediation efforts were dogged by bad luck. It is also true to say we were ineffective peace-makers. We finished up as the United States' junior partner instead of an equal one.</p>
<p class="contents">It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach. Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward, they did not go far enough. However, I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne, Faro and Helsinki Summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever institutional and other changes take place, there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one. The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point. The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis. Regrettably, the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU's influence and our foreign policy strategy. This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK, Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If actions like this continue, either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them, the EU's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters, despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have to add that I am very interested to find out how the report would fare next year, for just when the common foreign and security policy is being further detailed, it is meeting with enormous new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 11 September and subsequent events greatly impact on that policy. They will put it to the test. It is too early to gain a complete overview of the new security framework and the new threat. However, we would like to ask the Council and Commission to produce an initial evaluation as soon as possible. This evaluation should also touch upon the question to what extent the pillar structure forms an obstruction to effective action in the new situation. External policy has become internal policy, and vice versa. The European Union is not sufficiently prepared for this at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflict prevention and crisis management have taken on a different aspect. Our approach is often still too regional and too geographic. Horizontal issues must now be thrown into the spotlight. Increasing use must be made of regional policy in an integrated manner to tackle terrorism and international organised crime which are interrelated in many ways. The guiding principle in this should be to help each other. Take countries such as Ukraine. They form part of the problem which we are now facing because the lack of transparency in countries such as those, forms the ideal breeding ground for all kinds of crimes, to put it mildly. We have too little control over this because we have not sufficiently developed this kind of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe we have focused our attention too much on the Balkans. That region, too, is a source of security problems, but anyone who studies the ‘map of evil’ will realise that the new secondary routes of drugs, arms, illegal immigrants, etc. traverse the Slav Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that rapporteur Brok insists on a more effective implementation of EU strategies. There is more cause for this than ever before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My first point concerns conflict prevention. The case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provides us with an example of unsuccessful conflict prevention. If all of the Members of the Council had worked as intensively as Members of this Parliament have for years to put pressure on all Macedonian governments finally to put an end to the discrimination of the Albanian citizens of that country, then we would not be facing the difficulties and problems which we are now. If this issue had played a part in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement then the Members of the Council would also have seen it as a precondition and the terrorists from Kosovo would not have had any support for their campaign in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Macedonians would not now be under pressure of time to change their constitution almost because of the success of the terrorist campaign, because they would have already done so. So much for our failure to prevent conflict in this country!</p>
<p class="contents">A second matter which is very important to me was addressed by Mr Brok. I think that the Stability Pact should finally mark the end of the conferences and quick start packages. The Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reconstruction and should perhaps be extended to the Agency for Reconstruction and Development in this region. For this reason, the Stability Pact should be incorporated in the Commission's remit; this is where all of the work has to be done in any case. We would then be able to avoid resources being wasted because of friction, we would be able to achieve synergies and we would be able to make progress on establishing real stability in the region. In this way, we would, for example, be able to foster significant and large-scale cooperation in the energy sector. We would be able to make progress on the free trade area in the region, on constructing transport infrastructure and on combating trafficking in human beings and other commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Commission officials will in any case very soon be unemployed because the enlargement negotiations in the Commission are as good as closed in some areas. Let us give these people something to work on. Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it. Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and, perhaps, to one other wise man, Martti Ahtisaari, in addition, so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What should this policy be? September 11 revealed with one bang the prevailing error of the old security policy. A missile shield gives no defence against terrorism – I said this the night before at the meeting of our committee – nor can justice be created with weapons; at times, perhaps, it may be possible to put a stop to the perpetration of injustice. But we are so vulnerable that we are dependent on one another. The benefit of each depends on that of all others.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that a new fundamental policy line of dependency be created for the Union, both at the United Nations and at the WTO (concerning which we were speaking) and also within the Union. Internal and external security policy must be connected; the difference between them, after all, has disappeared. In this policy of dependency, we will use, in the first instance, social workers instead of soldiers; nurses instead of bombs; and teachers instead of missiles. The more people and nations receive justice, the less terrorism will be generated; this is something which we all know.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the Commission to shape a clear fundamental policy line of dependency for all fields. We must get away from armed security, this hangover from the cold war. Who could sleep peacefully with bombs under the bed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall, therefore, try to play the role of nurse, by answering, at least in part, Mr Morillon’s question, which concerns the role of the King in a future Afghan government.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Alliance, as its name suggests, is composed of various ethnic groups from Northern Afghanistan. It clearly does not represent the Pashtuns, who account for half of the Afghan population and it goes without saying, therefore, that a government formed or dominated by the Northern Alliance would not meet the criterion of being representative, any more than the Taliban government does, not to mention neighbouring Pakistan’s position on the Northern Alliance, with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the objective is, therefore, to bring together, in a government, sufficiently representative groups, with the support of Afghanistan’s neighbours. The King’s role, if he is to have one, must, in my opinion, be considered with this objective in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr Morillon, is basically all I can say on the subject. I admit that it does not provide a completely adequate answer to your question and I shall ensure that you are given a more precise answer tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you, Mrs Pack, that the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo has done a good job and I think that everyone would recognise that. The links between the Stability Pact, the Agency and the action undertaken by my colleague, Mr Patten will probably, at the right time, be open to suggestion.
