One of the many examples of this is the summit which is held with Russia every six months under the different Presidencies of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1999, the European Union adopted a common strategy with regard to Russia, the ultimate aim of which is to strengthen the strategic association between Russia and the European Union. The fundamental intention of this is to promote the consolidation of democracy, the Rule of Law and the market economy in Russia and to increase the stability of Europe, promoting global security and confronting the common challenges facing the European continent by means of intensified cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The 9th EU/Russia Summit will take place in Moscow on 29 May; during that summit we will assess the progress in our relations in various areas, on the basis of the results achieved since the last summit, which took place in Brussels last October. We will take note of the progress made since then and establish new objectives for our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been numerous meetings between the European Union and Russia since the last summit in Brussels. The cooperation agreement, which is the contractual basis of our relations, has proved to be an enormously effective instrument in terms of a fluid dialogue in all its various aspects. Furthermore, the orientations established by the Laeken European Council, have set concrete guidelines for the Union’s policy on Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">An important contribution to the preparation of the summit, the agenda for which is being finalised at the moment, has been made by the 5th EU/Russia Cooperation Council, held in Luxemburg on 16 April. The formal preparation of the summit has begun with various working meetings held in Brussels by the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretary-General of the Council with the Russians on 29 April and 13 May. There were also contacts in Brussels on 23 April between President Prodi, accompanied naturally by the Commissioner responsible for External Relations, Mr Patten, and the Russian Prime Minister, Mr Kassianov, for the preparation of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in Moscow, on 27 May, on the eve of this meeting, the deputy Vice-President of the Spanish Government, Mr Rato, together with the Commissioner responsible for European Union economic affairs, Mr Solbes, will make a presentation of the euro to the Russian financial sector. On that same day there will be a conference in Moscow on the integration of the European Union and Russia in the twenty-first century with the participation of various representatives of the Russian Government, the Commission and myself representing the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to point out that the Russia/EU Summit will take place soon after the Russia/US Summit, when President Bush will be in Moscow. This meeting between Russia and the United States will take place between 24 and 26 June. And just a day after the NATO/Russia Summit, our summit with Russia will take place, on 29 May. There is therefore a sequence of events which will consist of Russia holding a summit with the United States on 24 to 26 May, then, on 28 May, the agreement with NATO will be signed in Rome, and this will be followed by the Russia/EU Summit in Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the contents of the summit, the European Union and Russia have so far agreed a draft agenda covering the following points: recent events in the Russian Federation and in the European Union, security issues and the fight against terrorism, Russia/EU relations and international issues relating to the different regions of the world. I am going to expand on some of these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to recent events in the Russian Federation, the summit will deal fully with the reform process under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to the development of recent events in the European Union, the Community will report on the state of the enlargement negotiations, the development of the discussions within the framework of the European Convention and the development of the security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to security issues and the joint fight against terrorism, Russia intends to report on the results of the Russia/United States and Russia/NATO Summits – this consultation is of particular importance today, given the announcement of the reduction in nuclear warheads. The situation in terms of cooperation in the fight against terrorism will also be examined. You will understand perfectly that this issue is a priority for both the Union and for the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and Russia must naturally appear in several points on the agenda. A joint declaration to be issued at the end of the summit will include the conclusions by the two parties on the numerous points in the chapter on relations between Russia and the European Union. The declaration will have the same structure as the one relating to the Brussels Summit and will refer to foreign, security and defence policy, cooperation in terms of justice and home affairs, Kaliningrad, the common European economic area, trade and investments, energy dialogue, the environment and nuclear security, and scientific, technological and space cooperation. I will comment briefly on all of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to international issues of mutual interest, both parties have named the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans as priority issues, for which the exchange of information is particularly useful, since both the European Union and the Russian Federation share concerns and responsibilities in these areas. Furthermore, the European Union has particular interest in cooperating with the Russian Federation on the prevention of conflicts in areas of common interest, such as Moldavia, especially in relation to the Trans-Dniéster conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issues relating to foreign, security and defence policy, at this Russia/EU Summit we hope to agree an ad hoc declaration on the strengthening of dialogue and cooperation in the political and security fields. The declaration must reflect the progress observed in the implementation of the new cooperation mechanisms agreed at the Brussels Summit. Furthermore, the declaration must refer to the document which we hope will be adopted at the European Council in Seville on means of cooperation and consultation between the European Union and Russia in terms of crisis management. This important document will involve the development and establishment of the general principles for cooperation between the European Union and Russia in this field, which were adopted at the previous Paris, Moscow and Brussels Summits, and at the European Council in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cooperation on justice and home affairs, there has already been one result which the summit will acknowledge, which was the meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of the Russian Federation and the European Union, which took place on 25 April on the initiative of the Presidency of the Union. This has been the first time that Ministers from the Union and the Russian Federation have met to discuss common issues which fundamentally involve the whole issue of organised crime, immigration problems and the fight against terrorism. One of the significant results of this ministerial meeting is the approval of a joint resolution on the designation of central points of contact for the exchange of information on organised crime within the framework of the Action Plan to combat organised crime in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers also dealt with the situation of Kaliningrad, which is of particular interest to Russia. I would like to refer to this next, because the situation of the Kaliningrad enclave is an issue of particular importance in terms of relations between Russia and the European Union. In the very near future this Russian enclave, which is currently surrounded by Lithuania and Poland, will become an enclave within Community territory, when these two countries join the Union. Therefore, in terms of its relations with the European Union, it is one of Russia’s priorities to find a satisfactory solution, above all, to the problems of the free movement of people.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental problem of the movement and transit of persons stems from the transit between the enclave and the rest of the territory of the Russian Federation between the time when the candidate countries join the Union and the time when they fully apply the Schengen legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue was dealt with at the meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers between the Fifteen and Russia, which I mentioned previously, and the Russian Federation communicated a memorandum on this issue. This issue was also dealt with during the recent visit by Prime Minister Kassianov to the European Commission. Naturally, Russia’s positions do not entirely coincide with what the Member States have agreed and we as Presidency have made considerable efforts to create a common approach, and in producing it we have taken particular account, of course, of the interests of Poland and Lithuania given that they are future Members of the Union which have been kept informed of the progress of the exchanges with Russia on this issue. This common line has been confirmed by COREPER and has been communicated to the Russians.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of socio-economic problems, various activities which are at the preparatory or the implementation stage are going to require a sum of some EUR 40 million within the framework of the TACIS programme, intended for a package of measures aimed at implementing various activities within the enclave. To this sum we have to add the bilateral contributions of the Member States. The European Union is naturally prepared to study other formulae along with the Russians for funding which bring the standard of living of the inhabitants of Kaliningrad into line with the general economic context of the area surrounding it, essentially the two Member States, Poland and Lithuania, which we hope will very soon be members of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the common European economic area, which is another of the great issues in this bilateral relationship, the high-level group for the development of the concept of the common European economic area was formally established on 6 March 2002 and it met on 26 March. In December 2001 the first informal meeting took place. The summit will receive a provisional report on this issue, which will form the basis of the ad hoc declaration suggested by Russia. The Union would like to achieve a declaration by Russia of their intention to adopt European levels, bringing their legislation closer to the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>. At the Commission’s meeting with Prime Minister Kassianov, which I mentioned earlier, the Russian Prime Minister indicated that he was aware that the majority of the work of legislative approximation falls to Russia and the results of the high-level group will be presented at the Autumn Summit 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now comment on Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. Negotiations are continuing in relation to that accession following the significant impulse they have been given since last Autumn. Currently, the main differences relate to the agricultural, services and telecommunications sectors. At the meeting with Prime Minister Kassianov, the Commissioner responsible for Commercial Affairs, Mr Lamy, indicated that the Russian declaration on energy prices would also be a condition for progress in negotiations relating to the WTO. In short, it does not appear that there will be any substantial progress between now and the summit. At that summit the desire to promote the process will be demonstrated by the high frequency of meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue bears some relation to the consideration of Russia as a market economy. This is one of Russia’s main priorities within its relations with the European Union and at the recent meeting both Commissioner Patten, who is here today, and Commissioner Lamy, indicated to Mr Kassianov that the Commission was willing to study the possibility of granting Russia the status of a market economy. Although I should point out that the Presidency has detected, in its exchanges with the Member countries, that there are still some difficulties in terms of the internal sensitivities within the Union’s industrial sectors and in terms of the negotiations with the Russians, which, as I have said, are continuing. The Presidency at least hopes to achieve a solution in principle which is acceptable to both parties before the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these two issues: the WTO and Russia’s status as a market economy, one of the most important points in the relationship between the European Union and Russia is the energy dialogue. Amongst the main Russian concerns in this field are the possible negative consequences of enlargement for its energy exports to the new Member States, as well as the attention to capital originating from the European Union necessary for the modernisation of its infrastructures. For its part, the Union insists on the need to create the best possible conditions for foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else the Community has constantly demanded is the ratification by Russia of the Treaty we negotiated many years ago, the so-called energy charter and the transit protocol. We hope that at this summit a declaration will be adopted on the energy dialogue, as the Russians have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Also relating to energy is the issue of nuclear security, in turn determined by respect for the environment. In relation to this issue of the environment and nuclear security, the Community has indicated to Russia that one of the results we would like to achieve at the summit would be a commitment from Russia to ratify the text of the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible. To this end, prior to the Barcelona European Council, the President of the Council and the Commission, Mr Aznar and Mr Prodi respectively, addressed a letter to President Putin. With regard to nuclear security, our interest focuses on the signing by Russia of the agreement known as the Multilateral Nuclear and Environment Program in the Russian Federation. Despite the fact that at the 5th EU/Russia Cooperation Council in Luxembourg on 16 April, the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, announced that the outstanding issues relating to the signature of this agreement had been resolved, at the last minute problems have arisen on the Russian side which may delay this signature.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to stress the importance of environmental aspects in the implementation of the northern dimension action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is that of scientific and technological cooperation. Since the entry into force of the cooperation agreement with Russia relating to science and technology last May, cooperative relations in this field have made progress. This instrument, together with the international ITER agreement, forms the current basis of our joint work. It is possible that Russia will present its idea of establishing a joint research and technology centre in the Arctic. In principle, the idea may be included within the framework of our scientific and technological cooperation, but we will need to know more details about the nature of the Russian proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Arctic is an important source of energy supply for the European Union, we should analyse the possibility of including the centre in the field of energy dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the 9th Summit will be an opportunity to assess the various aspects of our relations with Russia and to establish new cooperation objectives for the future. We also hope that it will strengthen the already considerable dialogue between the Union and Russia and that opinions will be exchanged on issues of current international importance. This will thereby strengthen the strategic association between the Union and Russia, which is based on a range of shared values, the essential components of which are democracy, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus first on the wider issue of the EU-Russia Summit in Moscow at the end of the month. As the presidency has said, this Summit will mark the culmination of an intense schedule of high-level meetings between the European Union and the Russian Federation and it comes at a historic moment in relations between Russia and the West, with the Russia-Nato Summit in Rome at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat all the important meetings which the presidency has referred to, but we welcomed in particular Prime Minister Kasyanov's visit to the Commission on 24 April, and the meeting of European Union Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs with their Russian counterparts was exceptionally important.</p>
<p class="contents">A special Cooperation Committee is taking place in Kaliningrad this week precisely to discuss all the Kaliningrad-related issues. And we continue to hold discussions on crisis management and conflict resolution on a monthly basis with the Russian ambassador to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But what about content? Is the intense programme of EU-Russia meetings making progress? My answer is yes, albeit slowly. There is still a lot that both we and Russia need to do to become reliable strategic partners. But we can also welcome many changes that are taking place in Russia radically to reform the legal system, the economy, the military and the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment briefly – I will not cover all the ground covered by the presidency – on the main issues that will be discussed at the Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are satisfied with the way relations are developing in the field of ESDP, in which Russia is a natural key partner. Our message to Russia, however, is that security and defence policy needs to be seen as part of our broader political dialogue that also covers some of the present "frozen conflicts" in Europe, notably Transdniestria, which is a source of tremendous instability for Moldova, a future European Union neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the World Trade Organisation, we will reaffirm our political support for Russia’s accession. But we will not be shy in defending our interests, as in any trade negotiation. As Russia’s main trading partner, the European Union will play a key role in defining the entry standards in the Geneva negotiations. From our perspective, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is the point of departure, and Russia must, at least, go beyond the concessions already made in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the related issue of Russia’s demand to be treated as a market economy in anti-dumping procedures, the Commission has already submitted a proposal to the Council that will improve the position of Russian companies, and we are looking at whether there is more we can do to meet their concerns. As the presidency said, it was a subject that we were able to discuss with Mr Kasyanov. We hope that in return Russia will be able to respond to our proposals, notably concerning double energy pricing, and the adoption of a conciliation system under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to help ensure trade disputes are tackled in an objective, efficient and non-politicised manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit will also examine a progress report from the High Level Group on a common European economic space. This long-term initiative is meant to underpin Russia’s ongoing economic reforms and should help Russian companies to take advantage of the prosperity that European Union enlargement will bring. Against the backdrop of accession to the World Trade Organisation, cooperation with Russia should promote coherence between our respective legislative standards based on studies of the likely benefits for Russian industries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit will also look at a progress report on the energy dialogue, which moved into a more concrete phase at the Brussels Summit last October.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency referred to the importance of the environment in our dialogue. We will, among other things, be pressing Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, ideally before the UN Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me to turn now to the question of Kaliningrad, which is rightly high on Parliament’s agenda, as demonstrated by Mrs Hoff’s excellent report and the visit on the ground by the parliamentary delegation for Russia in April last year. We will also take careful account of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights drafted by Mr Oostlander.</p>
<p class="contents">We share Parliament’s view that, as part of Russia, Kaliningrad is essentially a Russian responsibility. We also believe that European Union enlargement is an opportunity from which Kaliningrad can greatly benefit, rather than a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made huge efforts to work with Russia on Kaliningrad, addressing both the impact of enlargement and future development policy as part of a comprehensive approach. We have made clear our willingness to increase financial and technical help to deal with the challenges faced by Kaliningrad, to facilitate cooperation between customs and immigration authorities in Russia, Lithuania and Poland, and to address the movement of persons and transit issues by exploring the flexibility permitted by the Schengen acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Under excellent leadership from the Spanish presidency, Member States have recently confirmed that we cannot derogate from the Schengen acquis, nor undermine the enlargement negotiations themselves. Visa-free transit corridors are not acceptable to the applicant countries. I hope Russia will accept this and work with us to make border crossing – which is the real impediment to progress – quicker and easier. Efforts are needed from both sides since we need to agree on how to take forward some key issues before further assistance can be offered. In this context, we shall be looking for progress on a readmission agreement and improved cooperation on border management. We also hope that Russia will make easier the establishment of consulates in Kaliningrad and in mainland Russia, and ensure that those who live in Kaliningrad are issued with passports that conform with international standards. We hope that the special meeting of the Cooperation Committee tomorrow in Kaliningrad can make further progress on these issues with a view to the Moscow Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words on human rights and democratic principles where we continue to have concerns regarding the rule of law and media freedom. The Summit will provide a further opportunity to underline the benefits for Russia of improving her image in these areas and our willingness to support the development of democratic institutions through Tacis.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Chechnya remains hugely worrying and reports of human rights violations during so-called "mopping up" operations have not, unfortunately, stopped. Our position remains simple and clear. We condemn terrorism world-wide, including in Chechnya. Our calls for a political solution which, without prejudice to the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, satisfies the majority of the Chechen people, does not undermine our support for the fight against terrorism everywhere. We will also continue to raise with Russia the issue of operating conditions for the delivery of humanitarian aid. In spite of difficult security conditions on the ground, we demand concrete improvements to facilitate the conduct of humanitarian operations according to basic safety and efficiency standards. In parallel, we will insist that any repatriation of Chechen displaced persons should only take place on a voluntary and unconditional basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also intend to make progress in the field of crisis management and conflict prevention. Against the background of our efforts to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has made clear to Russia that it expects her to act in full accordance with the values she committed herself to respect when entering the Council of Europe and the OSCE. These basic principles constitute an integral part of the strategic partnership that we are trying to build together.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a defining period in anchoring Russia firmly in the community of democratic nations. Against the backdrop of Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and the agreement on a new format for cooperation between Russia and NATO, we are confident that the EU-Russia Summit in Moscow will bring our bilateral partnership one step forward, rendering our cooperation more concrete and effective. The Commission is ready to continue to play an active part in this process. I am confident that the European Parliament will continue to make a very valuable contribution as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one final, simple point. We share so much with Russia: much geography and, in some respects, too much history. The only sensible option for both of us is to make our relationship work as successfully as possible: economically, socially and politically. This is a really significant strategic partnership – a partnership enhanced by enlargement. Perhaps we still have some of the ghosts of the past to lay to rest; ancient suspicions to bury once and for all. But the view of the Commission is that we should do all we can to make this partnership work and work well. There is no other sensible option. But a partnership involves traffic in both directions: it involves give and take and understanding the other side’s point of view. We understand that, and I am sure our Russian colleagues will come to understand that as well.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Erika (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> deputy rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, thank you for your kind words. I know that my colleague Mrs Hoff would like to address a few words to you herself at the end of the speech which I am going to read out on her behalf, but I will thank you at the start. Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the accession of Poland and Lithuania will make Kaliningrad not only a Russian enclave, but also an enclave of the European Union. This problematic, unique and positively paradoxical situation results from the fact that Kaliningrad, being Russian territory, falls within the scope of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Moscow, but is in fact rather more affected by European Union enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention was drawn to Kaliningrad's precarious situation as long ago as 1994, in a report by Parliament which described the future of the Kaliningrad region as a matter of immediate and pressing importance for Russia, for the states bordering on the region, and, equally, for the European Union. The practical response was, even then, to decide on measures which have become, in the meantime, even more relevant to the area's growth prospects. One can take as examples of this the encouragement of cross-border cooperation as well as the increased integration of the Kaliningrad area into European transport and telecommunications structures. It is to be regretted that adequate use has not been made of the time that has elapsed since then. Now, in the context of the strategic partnership which we are aiming at and of which you have spoken, new possibilities are taking shape, involving the neighbouring Poland and Lithuania, for finding solutions to Kaliningrad's situation, solutions that will ensure the area's viability and perhaps even enable it to play an active part in joining the partners together. At the same time, I would like to echo what was said as long ago as 1994 by emphasising that any consideration of Kaliningrad's future development must start from the premise that the area will continue to belong to Russia under international law and that its legal status will be determined solely by those competent to do so in Moscow and in Kaliningrad itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two possible scenarios, one negative and the other positive. A negative scenario would see the European Union's relationship with Russia under great strain, with both sides having failed an important test of their ability to cooperate and prevent crises in accordance with the partnership agreement. In the positive scenario, however, Kaliningrad could take on the overall role of a centre of economic activity and as a point of reference for transport links, commercial activity and modern services in a dynamic Baltic region. The area could, by piloting the implementation of economic structural reforms, influence the whole of north-western Russia and bind this cross-border region more closely with Europe. An amicable settlement on Kaliningrad could, in short, be a model for how the partnership between the EU and Russia might become practical rather than existing in name only.</p>
<p class="contents">New flexibility is, in the meantime manifesting itself on both sides as the acute need for action becomes apparent. I welcome President Prodi's recent reference to the need to make arrangements for Kaliningrad even before Poland and Lithuania join the EU, the Commission having elaborated some ideas on the subject in its 2001 communication on Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also positive is President Putin's evident commitment to a constructive negotiated solution. I do not propose, in what follows, to go in to detail into the various areas which we need to sort out together, but I would like to make just a few basic observations. People are understandably touchy about the issue of visas and border controls, and here a balance needs to be achieved between tight controls on the EU's external borders on the one hand, and the need for easier passage across the border on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia will also have to face up to the need for fundamental acceptance of the rules applicable under Community law, and we are working on the assumption that it will accept them. On this point, the EU cannot allow any exceptions to be made, as this would be to prejudge the cases of other border regions. For its part, the European Union should, at the same time, be considering what range of options there might be for a less onerous visa system within the Schengen boundaries, over and above the instances referred to in the communication. My report includes a number of proposals for a way ahead on this. The inclusive offer to partly integrate Kaliningrad into the Baltic area must be revived, but not by a border regime that excludes people.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexible arrangements for the transport of people and goods may well be important preconditions for Kaliningrad's growth process, and they also have symbolic value in the eyes of people in the no-man's-land between containment and exclusion, but, despite what many in Moscow continue to believe, they are not enough to bring about growth on their own. We have seen that at the open borders of Poland and Lithuania. Kaliningrad's economic indicators are mainly negative and still show no definite upward tendency. The living standard in the border region is significantly inferior to that in Russia as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">One essential cause for the persistent downturn is certainly Kaliningrad's problematic geographical situation and its favourable treatment as regards taxes and customs duties, the whole of which has a natural tendency to facilitate criminal activity. Any opening up of Kaliningrad to the outside world must therefore be combined with profound economic and administrative reforms in the region. Without these, there is the danger that local industries, which are uncompetitive, will largely be cut out of the market by their foreign competitors and that foreign investors will be even less committed in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, to the leaders in Moscow and Kaliningrad, who bear responsibility for the region, that we appeal for the creation on the ground of the conditions for good governance in the form of administrative, legal and political structures that work, are transparent, and can be relied upon. At the same time, there are many ways in which these efforts might be supported. In particular, it would make sense to set up an investment agency that could lay the financial foundations for this. This of course involves continued intensive cooperation within the TACIS framework and the willingness to make funds for this purpose available through the international financial institutions, among which I particularly mention the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to conclude by handing over to my colleague Magdalena Hoff.</p>

I am not yet well enough to stand while I talk to you, but please do not think I am being rude. Also, I do not wish to talk for longer than necessary, but I would just like to thank everyone who has helped in preparing the report, which Commissioner Patten has said the Commission will take into account in the negotiations at the Moscow Summit. Thank you very much, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the debate on this report is being held in the right place, that is to say during a joint debate on the Russian Federation, makes it clear once again that we still believe it is up to the Russian Government to ensure that reasonable conditions prevail in Kaliningrad. A delegation from this House recently visited Kaliningrad, and anyone travelling through this region or walking through the city is bound to be horrified, unless they close their eyes. We had an opportunity to discuss matters with the mayor of Kaliningrad, who complained bitterly that the last visit by representatives of the European Union had raised hopes about the construction of a new hospital. In this context, help for patients with TB is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that has been mentioned by the previous speakers – human rights issues, public health and environmental policy – are issues that must be tackled and where help is needed. One thing is sure, and we should not lose sight of this, because it also underscores what Commissioner Vitorino has said: there will be no real peace in Europe until we have managed to breathe life into the partnership and cooperation agreement. I hope we will succeed, but I will not be too concerned as long as the points mentioned here by the various representatives of the presidency, the Commission and of this House itself are also discussed at the Moscow Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks for giving me a few minutes' speaking time. I am sure we will continue to strive to ensure, working jointly where necessary, Mrs Lalumière, that what has been agreed by Parliament so far is actually implemented and becomes a practical policy. Thank you very much indeed! I would particularly like to thank Erika Mann, who, when I asked her if she would present my contribution here agreed to do so without hesitation. Thank you very much, Erika!</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to express my sympathy for the victims of the attack in Kaspiisk in Dagestan, who were murdered on 9 May. There were many children amongst the more than 30 people killed. As Commissioner Patten has already said, terrorism can never be justified. We hope that nothing like this will ever happen again. As Commissioner Patten and Mr de Miguel, the President-in-Office, have said – and I hope that they will raise this at the summit – we call on the Russian Government, should it turn out that these attacks, these acts of violence were committed by Chechens – and in the case of Dagestan that is a supposition for which there is still no proof – not to equate these terrorists, these perpetrators of violence with the Chechen people. No, the civilian population of Chechnya should be protected…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and we should use the negotiating process to ensure that Chechnya has a good future.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we believe that our relations with Russia are of a strategic nature. Our relations with the United States are of strategic significance, our relations with the Mediterranean area are of strategic significance and of course the enlargement of the European Union is also of strategic significance, but as I have said, so are our relations with Russia. Our relations need to be founded on democratic principles, on the rule of law, on social and market-economy principles and above all on human rights and human dignity. It is on that basis that we wish to cooperate with Russia politically, economically and in terms of security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to emphasise what has already just been mentioned here – a common European economic area and maximising cooperation with Russia. However, I would like to add, because this is occasionally mentioned, that I cannot imagine, and nor can the majority of my group, in fact I think we are as one on this, that Russia could become a member of the European Union, in view of its size. I think that needs saying, in all honesty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do want to extend economic relations, to dismantle trade barriers and to encourage greater investment in Russia. That means overcoming certain obstacles. We wish to cooperate in the area of internal security. Not long ago I visited Finland with the chairman of our group. Finland shares a common border with Russia and has exemplary security controls on that border. We need to create something comparable for all our borders with Russia. I wish to call on the Russian Government to do its part to make sure that we also achieve security in relation to Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already used up my speaking time, I would just like to add that we have every intention of stepping up relations with the Russian Federation, because security in our continent in the twenty-first century is largely dependent on the European Union and Russia being able to act, and on Russia hopefully also being democratic, because together there is a great future for us in the European continent that we share.</p>

At the same time we obviously hope, Magdalene, that you will be able to come back to work and that we will be able to make use of your immense knowledge of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Kaliningrad will prove to be either a positive or negative example of relations between the EU and Russia, one that will either take the form of cooperation or mean problems. A good scenario would be one which gave rise to a pilot project for Russia and our whole next enlargement process. It would mean compliance there with WTO regulations, leading to Russia’s membership of that organisation. Respect for the law, stability, and civil society would grow and start to become established, and we would aid the process using our entire arsenal: TACIS, PHARE, Interreg, and so on. Our trade would increase and people would be able to move freely. A bad scenario would be one in which the gap in living standards grows wider, creating unrest within the Union, whereas unrest is now to be found outside the Union. It would be a rudimentary kind of civil society – crime is already 2% higher than elsewhere in Russia – and the movement of the population might turn into a new Berlin crisis. This is therefore a scenario we do not wish to see, although it must be borne in mind that now is a time of opportunity for us, if Russia’s new administration understands that. In any case Kaliningrad will become a barometer of our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as Commissioner Patten said, that the EU-Russia Summit in the coming weeks will represent a culmination point. Russia has a lot of problems and one is that relations between Russia and the United States of America have been of very little benefit to the Russian people, who do not really understand the situation. For this reason we should propose a five-point programme to bring our relations closer: the European Economic Area, WTO membership, cooperation on energy, the northern dimension and a concrete Kaliningrad Agreement. Just five points, ladies and gentlemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further shadow boxing and fine-sounding speeches are more in evidence than actual results.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that there is an alarming risk that, to some extent, relations between the United States, Russia and the EU will come to resemble those we are seeing in the Middle East. Are we in the EU the only people to be concerned about human rights, freedom of expression, media pluralism, the environment and, perhaps too, the position of the organisations representing citizens? What is actually happening in Kaliningrad? What is in fact happening in the energy dialogue? We are waiting for results.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening with the environmental partnership in the northern dimension? In the context of quite a few summits, the EU has said that something must happen. The EU has made decisions to enable it to finance important environmental projects in north-western Russia, but the Russian Federation is not playing its part. Are we to promise WTO and NATO membership or should we perhaps demand results from the Russian side as preconditions for such membership?</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency and the Commission touched upon the issue of responsibility for nuclear waste, and specifically the MNEPR Agreement. How many times are we to see the Presidency, for example the Swedish Presidency, seeking results? The issue is postponed, first for six months and then year after year, while all the time we know that the clock is ticking for untreated waste and that the submarines in Murmansk may begin to leak. We also know that, in my country, we have major problems with land transport to Russia where agreed deadlines are not complied with and additional costs are incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also appeal to you to address difficult issues in the negotiations with Russia. I would say, finally, to the Presidency that other summits and other heads of government have not hesitated to address the situation of kidnapped children. This issue must also be addressed in a serious dialogue. I myself am aware of quite a few children, for example Maria Sobeva and Tommi Ylönen, who have been kidnapped and taken to Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fellow MEPs, we have all listened carefully to the speech by Mr Miguélez. For fifteen minutes, and more, he talked about Russia, but never mentioned Chechnya. How is this possible, Mr Miguélez? I do not understand. There has nevertheless been a great deal of consultation with the Russian authorities recently. Lengthy discussions have been held, and what is the outcome? Business as usual. We have talked about the economy. I even heard my own Prime Minister mention this when he met Mr Kasyanov. Despite this, surely we have now learnt from the conflicts in Kosovo, in Bosnia Herzegovina, that conflict prevention is crucial. That it is the alpha and omega of every peace policy. We give Russia an enormous amount of financial aid: EUR 65 million via Echo for humanitarian services, and 2.5 billion over the past decade via Tacis. Should we not be able to use this money to engage in conflict prevention at long last? Mr Miguélez, I urge you not only to talk about the economy and free trade in Moscow, but also about Chechnya, about observing human rights, and the persecution of environmental activists. I implore you to do this. You will help make the European Union more credible if you do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the Second World War, the peoples of the world have given the UN Security Council many rights and a high degree of responsibility for security and for maintaining peace. Even if the Soviet Union no longer exists as a victorious power and as a former second superpower alongside the USA, Russia, as its successor state, is not an unimportant country. Russia has nuclear weapons, it has boundless resources, and it has played a key role in shaping European and world history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The expanded European Union has greater scope for partnership with Russia if the residual fears stemming from the Cold War can be overcome and if, for example, economic cooperation with the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe can be harnessed and not deliberately excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to move away from a policy of conflict throughout Europe we should not create new confrontational situations based on a new geographical strategy. We should instead offer Russia a genuine and practical partnership. In doing that we certainly should not treat the number of meetings and summits as some kind of yardstick. No, what we need to measure is real results. Our area of common interest is so great that cooperation and economic partnership with Russia is the only reasonable way forward, which in the long run will be of benefit to both sides and will promote security and lessen social tensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that I have a great deal of admiration for the way in which she has done this and for the tact with which she also continuously underlines Russian interests, so that we, in our concern for Kalinigrad, do not meet with any distrust from Moscow. Mrs Hoff is extremely skilled in this area. In fact, Kaliningrad is one of her specialist areas, and I have therefore always listened with great respect to her reports and her judgment, in particular, and we have always been quite happy to cross swords in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Kaliningrad is not Konigsberg any more. Anyone who has ever lived there will recognise very little and will no longer feel at home there. We would have hardly paid any attention to the region if it were not for the fact that it will be forming an enclave in the European Union. Proximity brings with it responsibility, and I believe that this has also been an important motive for the rapporteur. We should take an interest in the future of the people who live there. This is why it is right that the rapporteur not only considered the macro aspects, but also the practical day-to-day needs of the citizens of Kaliningrad. Our main concern in this respect is not to allow them to be left in isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">The roads to the other parts of the Russian Federation must be easily passable, as must those to the future EU Member States. The latter are possibly considered to be more important than the former. In my view, travelling to the European Union unhindered takes priority. Hence the pressure to solve the visa issue, albeit within the Schengen framework – we should not kid ourselves – in a flexible manner. After all, many of the restrictions are man-made. The problems at the borders are all too often caused by sluggishness on the part of the staff, time-consuming, bureaucratic habits and suchlike. It is therefore of major importance for a mentality to be instilled which befits the rule of law, democracy and a social market economy. Needless to say, developing contacts between civil-society organisations in the European Union and in Kaliningrad and elsewhere in Russia could also prove crucial, because these particularly deal with day-to-day actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Hoff for accepting my amendments from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and particularly for the humour with which she has responded to the ploys which I have used in the process. Many thanks and I wish her all the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is of course a danger of us constantly hearing the same eloquent but trite speeches about how important cooperation is, and about how special Kaliningrad's situation is.

<p class="contents">That is why we need new approaches to the instruments available, new approaches to minor border traffic, new approaches to economic cooperation, new approaches to transnational cooperation and above all – and, Commissioner, I would like to appeal you once more about this – new approaches to the use of financial instruments.

This partnership, which needs to cover both economic and political matters, is one of the key requirements for a peace and stability policy in the twenty-first century. Europe and Russia are a great deal more dependent on each other than might appear to be the case at first sight. Whenever there has been strife between Europe and its individual states on the one hand and Russia on the other, this has had a major impact on world politics. The present situation demands that we should create a starting point that prevents such conflicts arising in the long run. This requires us to establish mutual respect and a basis of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chechnya conflict is of course a major problem.

<p class="contents">I genuinely believe that Mrs Hoff’s report is a fine example of the essential contribution that the European Parliament makes to the work of the institutions. Commissioner Patten rightly stated that the substance of this report will guide and inspire us in our relations with Russia. The Presidency takes the same view. Consequently, I should like to express my gratitude for this important work, which is often carried out quietly and anonymously, because it is right that sometimes, such as now, it should step into the limelight and be publicly acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say that I agree with practically all the opinions that have been expressed here on all the aspects, both positive and negative, of our relationship with Russia. These relations are as they are and not as we would like them to be. Russia, with all its advantages and with all its disadvantages, is a great country, with which we share a common area: the great European plain. It is, furthermore, a country with which, due to the special historical circumstances in which the Union now has to live, and by this I mean the end of the cold war, the fall of the Berlin wall, enlargement towards the countries of the east that were previously satellites of Russia, for which the Second World War was to blame as were we, since we left many of these countries – and our historical conscience pricks us about this – under Russia’s influence.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to make up this lost ground and we are doing so with enlargement, which consists of integrating into the great European family all these countries that were cruelly separated from it. At the same time, however, Russia is there and, consequently, Russia is no longer the distant Eastern adversary of the bipolar world that it once was. Russia is now our neighbour. Once enlargement takes place, we will have to share not only borders, but also, as in the case of Kaliningrad, we will have to share responsibilities, because, regardless of their nationality, the inhabitants of Kaliningrad are human beings about whom we must be concerned because we are committed to this city’s not becoming a pocket of poverty tacked onto the Union, but a pocket of prosperity. Creating an area of prosperity and leaving, for example, a pocket of poverty in Kaliningrad has no place in the European Union’s scale of values.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we want to see Russia make progress in all areas, at both the economic and commercial level and at the legal and institutional level and also in relation to respect for the great humanist principles, for human rights and for the Rule of Law, that are our badge of identity. This is why we have to work on all areas, increasing, as best we can, our cooperation with Russia in the economic and commercials spheres. Also, as we have already stated, within the third pillar, we have already made significant progress, by holding meetings between Russian and EU Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and on the issue of respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not mentioned Chechnya, because a sitting was dedicated almost entirely to this issue last month and I should like to remind Mr Staes that if he wants to know what the Presidency’s position on Chechnya is, he should attend the sittings or read the Minutes of this Parliament, because it is unacceptable for us to hold a debate on Chechnya lasting hours, for the Presidency and the Commission to state their position and the following month for someone to claim that we are saying nothing on the matter. Mr Staes had the opportunity to be here and to participate in this debate if he had so wished. If he was not present, it is neither my fault nor that of the Presidency, but his own.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say the same to Mrs Thors, who has been reproaching the Presidency. I should like to remind her that her country of origin, Finland,<span class="italic"> </span>held the Presidency of the Union a short while ago and I should also like to remind her that Spain was actually the first country, at Presidency level, to visit Kaliningrad. I would also remind her that we are a very long way from Kaliningrad, unlike Finland, which lies just opposite that city. Consequently, if any reproaches are to be made on these matters, they should be fair ones. We have done all that we could, in excellent cooperation with the Commission, which is doing an admirable job, and with which we have had an excellent relationship. I believe that we are making great efforts to take steps forward with Russia, steps that are sometimes smaller, sometimes larger, but little by little we are building a relationship and frankly, I do not think there are currently grounds for reproaching anyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I took part in that debate; let there be no mistake about that. Since 10 April, however, various meetings have taken place at ministerial level. If I have my facts right, a Cooperation Council took place in Luxembourg on 16 April. A Justice Council and a Home Affairs Council have been held. Mr Kasyanov, the Prime Minister, has visited Brussels. He has met various dignitaries and our own President of the Parliament. He has met Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Maystadt and Mr Prodi. All my sources of information also suggest that the Council does not really take Parliament’s view into consideration. That you do nothing to actually place the Chechen issue on the political agenda. If you really believe that you do not need to read the compromise resolution that is before us today and that you do not need to listen to Parliament’s ultimate question – which will hopefully be answered tomorrow – namely to place the Chechen issue separately on the agenda, then I think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you are really not doing your job at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have always stated our opinion, in all meetings, at all levels – including the political level – and we have never allowed the issue of Chechnya to be excluded from our bilateral talks but we have always discussed the matter with the respect that is due to a sovereign country. Of course, we would never confuse the issue of Chechnya with accusations of murder, such as we have heard here today, and I am talking about the accusation that General Lebed was murdered by the Russian Government because he held certain positions on Chechnya. This is not, of course, the type of language we use, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I value the work that is being done for Kaliningrad, but I believe that, in common with the Commission, we have reason to wonder whether we are achieving the result we desire.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, it seems as if our relationship with Russia is merely a ‘give’ relationship on our part and a ‘take’ relationship on theirs. Unfortunately, we have many examples of this. One is the northern dimension in which, as the Commissioner also pointed out in another context, we only have a plan of action, but no action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that we have repeated time and again that we wish to achieve results. Perhaps these summits are a reminder of the EU’s own in which the decisions are based on wanting to achieve something later. The real results, which is to say those that should be of crucial importance to the environment I live in, are not apparent, however. In this area, I would appeal to the President and the Commission: the whole of the EU needs to make an active and vigorous contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We as the Group of the Party of European Socialists and as German Social Democrats in particular wish to thank Mrs Hoff for coming here today. Despite her severe illness and the fact that she is confined to a wheelchair, Mrs Hoff, who has been a Member of the European Parliament since 1979, refused to forego the opportunity of presenting and defending her report in person, with the help of my colleague Erika Mann. We Social Democrats who as German Members of Parliament have for many years had the pleasure of working with her, have only one thing to say: we are proud of our colleague! I would like to present her with a bouquet of flowers, with your permission, Mr President, because there is no provision for such a thing in the Rules of Procedure. I hope that I will be joined in this gesture not only by my Social Democrat colleagues but also by all Members of this House, who can be proud to have a fellow Member of her calibre in their midst.</p>
