This dialogue was started in the framework of the Interinstitutional Agreement by means of various trilogues and a consultation meeting in July, on the very day that the Council adopted the draft budget for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that during the most recent discussions of your Committee on Budgets, quite a few members expressed their regret about the outcome of this consultation. As this outcome cannot be seen as an actual result, people have started to call the validity of this exercise into question.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two observations in this connection. First of all, we must see this consultation between the members of the Council and Parliament as an initiation of the dialogue between the two arms of the budgetary authority. Even if this consultation does not reap any immediate benefits, the discussions at the Council will still be affected by this during the coming months until the end of the budgetary procedure in December.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is true that, at the time of the consultation, the Council’s preparatory activities for July’s sitting had already reached an advanced stage, and that compromise solutions had already been found in order to remove various obstacles which had emerged between the Member States themselves. But it is also true, as I am sure you are aware, that the package which contains the compromise of the draft budget has already been influenced by the positions adopted by the European Parliament and which were known to us on account of the many contacts we have with this institution. Those contacts, which start out in February and March, coincide with the informal trilogue in the capital of the presidency, and will be developed at different levels until the Council in July. I can assure you that, without this permanent dialogue, the draft budget which is now before you could have taken on a completely different format.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I should like to make you aware of the fact that the Belgian Presidency sets great store by sound cooperation with Parliament. I should therefore like to explain to you directly the Council activities which have led to the draft budget for 2002 which is now before you and on the basis of which you will be preparing your first reading in the next two months.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to outline the guidelines which have helped the Council compile this draft budget. To start with, the draft budget is completely consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and the improvement guidelines for the budgetary procedure. The Council deems it of particular importance to keep to each of the annual maximum amounts for expenditure, as laid down in the financial perspectives and based on the recent EP and Council decision to adjust the financial perspectives with regard to budget implementation, and on the technical adjustment to GNP and price development, implemented by the Commission. The Council has ensured, insofar as is possible, that sufficiently wide margins will be maintained in respect of the maximum amounts for the different categories, with the exception of categories 2 and 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council has taken into consideration the budgetary guidelines for 2002 which it adopted in March of this year. You have undoubtedly noticed that the Council has adopted decisions of this kind for the first time. I am of the opinion that it is a sound approach. It constitutes a move towards greater transparency and hence an improvement in the budgetary debate. You have for some time now adopted budgetary guidelines yourselves which are used throughout your debates. The same applies to the Commission which establishes its priorities every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has therefore ascertained that the different EU measures are appropriately funded from the financial resources available within the maximum amounts set according to the financial perspectives. For this purpose, the Council has, with regard to commitment appropriations, taken account of the evaluation of the options to implement the appropriations. Finally, the Council has devoted special attention to the development of appropriations for payments by curbing their growth compared to 2001, taking particular account of the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with outstanding amounts and national budgetary requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline that these efforts to moderate are spread across the compulsory and non-compulsory expenses. I should also like to take the opportunity to remind you that the Council deems it desirable that the Commission once again, as it did last year, submit a letter of amendments with the proposal to include in the final budget for 2002 an estimate of the surplus available from 2001. Based on the above, the draft budget for 2002 provides for commitment appropriations the sum of EUR 99 009 million, i.e. an increase of 2%, and for payment appropriations EUR 95 598 million, which is also a 2% increase. The draft budget submitted to you is a compromise by means of which all policy areas and priorities of the European Union can be financed without placing too heavy a burden on the Member States who try to keep their public finances under control, and where room is given, especially under the maximum amount of category 3 of the financial perspectives and category 4, for fresh priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structural campaigns, the Council has allocated a high level of commitment appropriations, taking into consideration the pledges made in the framework of the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999 and the Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999. The pledges in this draft budget and the programmes which have been adopted within the framework of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council are in line with the jointly agreed scheduling. Administrative expenditure has been discussed in great detail by the Council. An attempt has been made, where possible, to meet the needs of the different institutions and to take account of the specific characteristics and the general objective of a moderate increase in administrative expenditure. I remain convinced that Parliament will follow the same path in the future budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the Agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council during the consultation of 20 July pertaining to a joint declaration is a good omen. Indeed, both our institutions have agreed to ask the Secretary-Generals of the institutions to draft a report for the budgetary authority, which includes a multi-annual analysis of category 5, and which is set for discussion in the Council for budgets in November. This report must set out the proportionate benefits achieved through strengthened interinstitutional cooperation, as well as the economic proposals required so as not to exceed the maximum in category 5. Both aspects have a bearing on preparations for the forthcoming enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not close off this general presentation of the draft budget for 2002 without mentioning two major issues in respect of which the Council has adopted a wait-and-see approach, because a number of elements, which were not to become apparent until later on in the budgetary procedure, have been missing. These issues are the BSE and foot and mouth crises on the one hand, and the fisheries agreement with Morocco on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as funding the effects of the BSE and foot and mouth crises is concerned, during the consultation of 20 July between the European Parliament and the Council, we concluded an agreement on a joint declaration in which the two arms of the budgetary authority were informed that, under the maximum of sub-category 1A of the financial perspectives, as laid down in the draft budget, a sufficient margin should be maintained to meet the needs in connection with the BSE and foot and mouth crises. We would ask the Commission to submit a detailed analysis of the needs and to meet those needs, first of all by using the appropriations still left from 2001, and secondly, by including the required appropriations for 2002 in its letter of amendments this coming autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financial implications of the absence of a fisheries agreement with Morocco, and the funding requirements to restructure the fishing fleet in question, the Council has stated that it would reconsider the situation in the framework of this year’s letter of amendments, which is required under the Interinstitutional Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents">For all those reasons, the Council has maintained the preliminary draft budget submitted by the Commission for the international fisheries agreement, and has asked the Commission only to earmark these appropriations for other fisheries agreements. I would take this opportunity to remind you of the fact that the appropriations for the international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, come under compulsory expenditure, irrespective of where that is: on the budget heading, in reserve or on a BA budget heading.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to give a complete outline of the draft budget. That can be found in the exhaustive explanation which has been sent to you. What I would like to do is to go into more detail, that is to say per category of expenditure, of what the Council has laid down in its draft budget for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning category 1 of the financial perspectives for agricultural expenditure, the draft budget has taken into consideration the implications of the decisions taken by the European Council of Berlin in March 1999 concerning the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy. Despite this, with regard to sub-category 1A of the financial perspectives, which covers the common agricultural policy, the Council has specified amounts which are generally EUR 200 million lower than the amounts which the Commission had proposed in its preliminary draft budget. This reduction does not provide for the discussion of the letter of amendments, which the Interinstitutional Agreement prescribes, and which requests that particular account be taken of the development of the markets and the state of negotiations on the different common market organisations. This reduction is mainly linear and particularly discounts the budget headings pertaining to the effects of BSE and foot and mouth, as well as the headings pertaining to the common market organisations, which form the subject of current negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as I explained a moment ago, the Council failed to adopt the principle of a reserve of EUR one billion, which the Commission had proposed in order to cover the effects of the BSE and FMD crises, and increase the margin in the process. The Council prefers to wait for the letter of amendments which is due this autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading by the Council, this leads to an increase in expenditure of the common agricultural policy by 2.3% compared to 2001. With regard to expenditure for agricultural development, the Council has adopted the proposed appropriations of the preliminary draft budget and has, consequently, incorporated the entire sub-category 1B of the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has included in the budget the whole of category 2 of the financial perspectives, which is dedicated to structural measures, as commitment appropriations, in line with the conclusions reached by the European Council of Berlin in March 1999. In addition, the Council has accepted nearly all payment appropriations from the preliminary draft budget and only reduced the Community initiative programmes by EUR 375 million, in view of the expected delay in the implementation thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of category 3 of the financial perspectives, which is dedicated to the financing of internal policy, the Council is committed to funding the multi-annual programmes in an appropriate manner. That is why it has accepted the amounts which the Commission had requested in its preliminary draft budget, especially for the framework programme for research and development of the trans-European networks. However, based on the anticipated price development, the Council has curtailed the commitment and payment appropriations, which are not accompanied by multi-annual programmes, together with appropriations for agencies. In the context of this category, I should like to point out that at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget, namely on the budget headings which were intended for this purpose in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, in order to launch Eurojust and the SIS2 system for Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the Council has ensured that its draft budget adequately covers the priorities within the internal policy of category 3 of the financial perspectives. Consequently, the Council has created a precautionary margin of EUR 110 million, which is more generous than the margin provided for in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. This margin should be sufficient to cover your priorities, a number of which were listed by your rapporteur, including <span class="italic">e</span>-learning and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the financing of the EU’s external action, included in category 4 of the financial perspectives. The Council has, to a very large extent, followed the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. Indeed, the Council has maintained major appropriations and carried out only minor reductions to the commitment and payment appropriations, geographically divided across a limited number of budget headings.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as already mentioned, the Council has maintained the appropriations for international fisheries agreements in their entirety. Finally, I regret that during the consultation meeting of 20 July, no agreement was reached concerning the amount of appropriations that need to be earmarked for the common foreign and security policy. That is why the Council has adopted in its draft budget the amounts which the Commission had proposed in its preliminary draft. I must confess that I do not entirely understand the requests to reduce the amounts to be allocated to common foreign and security policy. You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest and are really the minimum required to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage, especially in those regions which are being plagued by the crises with which we are all familiar. The wish to reduce those amounts could, more than anything, affect the European Union’s credibility, and I do not believe that that was your intention.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that it will become apparent as the budgetary procedure further unfolds, and especially from the outcome of your first reading, that you have been open to my reasoning, which is the Council’s reasoning, and that you will reach the same conclusion as I have with regard to the justification of the amounts proposed in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. As you can see, the Council has attempted to allocate adequate resources to the different priorities concerning the EU’s external action.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Council has added a margin of EUR 100 million under the maximum of category 4 of the financial perspectives, which will enable you to confirm your priorities in this sector. When the Council compiled its draft budget for administrative expenditure which falls within the scope of category 5 of the financial perspectives, as already stated, it followed an approach which aims to meet the needs of the institution as far as possible, taking into account their specific features.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commission’s staffing requests, the Council continues to support the reforms and voted in favour of 78 new posts at first reading. As for the other 239 posts, the Council had not adopted a position on this matter on 20 July. I would like to do this in light of the decision on the Regulation on the final termination of service by Commission officials.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget provides for a margin of EUR 53 million under the maximum of category 5 of the financial perspectives. This is to enable accommodation of fresh needs in the field of administrative expenditure, and the European data protection monitor, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish the overview of the different expenditure categories with the expenditure on pre-accession aid. The Council has, in this respect, maintained the amount that the Commission had earmarked in its preliminary draft budget for commitment appropriations. As for payment appropriations, a sharp increase by 20.9% compared to last year is provided for, following an adjustment in the form of a reduction by EUR 380 million of the amount which the Commission had included in the preliminary draft. This increase reflects the priority which the Council, backed by the European Parliament and the Commission, affords this expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not wish to close off this presentation of the draft budget, compiled by the Council on 20 July last, without underlining my intention to bring this budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion and, like last year, to reach agreement at the consultation which precedes the Council in November. It is, therefore, my wish that the budgetary talks be continued in the same spirit, so that for the budget year 2002, a budget of European Communities can be set up which affords us the means to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union is set to face shortly.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wynn (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets</span>. – Mr President, President-in-Office and Commissioner Liikanen – nice to see you. Commissioner Schreyer did say that she would be unavailable and that you would be standing in. It is like old times. I bet you are really glad to be here. Thank you, President-in-Office, for your kind words, but to be honest with you, I was extremely disappointed with the outcome of your first reading and especially with the way the conciliation went. Maybe we were spoiled last year during the French Presidency, which at least made some concessions, but this year it was back to normal. For 12 years I have made the same speech – I did not do it last year – saying that this is a budget for the Council’s first reading made by Coreper and the politicians have no input into it.</p>
<p class="contents">We try to get you to make political decisions, we put forward all our arguments and spend hours doing it (we have a very nice lunch in the meantime) and we get absolutely nowhere. It is a dialogue with the deaf. We talk and talk and we change absolutely nothing when it comes to the Council’s position. The difference between our two institutions is that we act as a Parliament should act. A Parliament should have a budget that reflects its political priorities. We do not spend money for the sake of spending money. We look at political priorities and then decide what should be allocated to them. What the Council wants to do is just keep expenditure to a bare minimum, no matter what the consequences or what it costs. We try to discuss issues like school milk. We made our point. Nothing happened. We spoke about the problems with the Structural Funds. Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="contents">On the internal policies, the medicines’ agency and orphan medicines were one of the issues mentioned. At the SAB last year we had an agreement with the Council to increase the funding for orphan medicines and what do you do this year? You take 1.9 million off it. It just does not make sense. When we talk about trying to take Cyprus and Malta out of category 4 and put them where they should belong, you are not interested. And then when we talk about the compensation for not having a Morocco fisheries agreement, here is where we get into really serious discussion, because again nothing happened. We were trying to make the point that if you want to create some monies in category 2, you need our agreement, unless you want to take it from existing Structural Funds. Let us be clear about the money that is in category 4 for the Morocco fisheries agreement. It is in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The only things we did agree at that conciliation were two bland statements, one on agriculture, one on category 5, but Parliament made a unilateral statement concerning the fisheries. I am going to remind you about one part, because when you spoke about looking at the letter of amendment and deciding what to do, in accordance with Annex IV of the IIA only the amounts entered in the budget for agreements, which have already been concluded by the Community, can be considered compulsory expenditure. Consequently, amounts entered in reserve – and that whacking big sum of EUR 125 million is in reserve – for agreements which have not been concluded, are considered to be non-compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council might want to argue about that, but we do not see any argument. We will have the final say on what happens and rest assured it will not be a trade-off as to whether we keep that in or take it out to create the same amount of money in category 2. That is something that we need to be talking about. We need to be serious about this budget, to look at expenditure, especially in category 5. What are we going to do about administrative expenditure, especially in relation to enlargement? The statement about getting the secretaries-general to look at how the institutions can work together is all very well but there is a much greater issue. We actually suggested that the budgetary authority should have a value for money exercise looking at every European Union institution. You did not even respond to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I just hope between now and our first reading, and indeed between now and your second reading, we can have some serious discussions and serious conciliation and at the end of it some serious agreements to get a budget that we can all be satisfied with. The one thing we will not stand accused of – I am not saying that you said this but many of your colleagues in the Council seem to think this – is that we just want to increase expenditure to the maximum so that we can finance the projects that we see as our favourites, while you want to be extremely prudent. We are extremely prudent. We are sensible in the way we handle things, but we want to do it as a team. We want to act as a budgetary authority, not going back to the old days where you voted on compulsory expenditure, we voted on non-compulsory and sometime in December we ended up with a budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that this year we can improve from what I consider to be not a good start to a far better understanding between our two institutions. If this Belgian Presidency is anything like the last Belgian Presidency when I did the 1994 budget, I will be extremely happy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Costa Neves (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in the months between now and December, we have a great deal of work to do in order to reach the necessary agreement on the next budget. The positions of the European institutions are currently quite far removed from one another on very important issues. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, there are prior conditions that must be met: the first is to ensure rigour and transparency in the budget and in its implementation; secondly, to only adopt a position if and provided that the necessary information is available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I must once again make my continuing objections perfectly clear. Where agriculture is concerned, we need information on the results that have already been achieved by the last reform of the common agricultural policy; with regard to the medium-term budgetary impact of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises and also with regard to the obstacles holding up the rapid establishment of the new food safety authority and even with regard to the prospects for the short and medium-term development of these issues. As for the structural funds, we want to be sure that the budget will have the necessary means to undertake speedy payment of the commitments it has taken on. Under the terms of the proposals that have been tabled, just over 1% of the commitments taken on in 2002 will be paid within the same year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of internal policy – category 3 – we can see that new expenditure on new actions and bodies is increasing yet the overall sum remains the same. The margin is, of course, decreasing. With regard to the European Union’s external action – category 4 – new needs are clear and cannot be met by previous reductions in commitments, either through cuts in appropriations committed or through delaying payments, as is happening now.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, appropriations have been earmarked for the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which we all know will not be concluded, in an attempt to thereby freeze EUR 125 million in a category that is clearly experiencing difficulties. Since this is non-mandatory expenditure, I feel sure that Parliament will also shoulder its responsibilities in this area. In category 5, administrative expenditure, on the one hand the content and pace of the Commission reform is limited and on the other, expenditure is duplicated in the field of security and defence and there is an attempt to confront enlargement without spending additional appropriations, the opposite of what the interinstitutional agreement lays down.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pre-accession expenditure, payments are being delayed and it is hard to see how this proposal can improve the situation. The implementation of previous budgets does not give any grounds for being sanguine about the future. Given the well-documented difficulties in meeting certain longstanding and more recent commitments, how can we accept the fact that in 2001, Member States have been given back almost EUR 10 billion, which remain unused? On the one hand, there are discussions about whether the euro is a good or a bad thing and on the other, 12% of the 2000 budget remains unused, which alone indicates how important it is for Parliament to take increasingly effective control of the budget’s implementation. We will only take decisions on agricultural issues if we have a full understanding of the present situation and an idea of how things are going to change. We cannot accept the level of payments that has been proposed, all the more so because we want to make good past delays without undermining the current situation. We want a clear and objective definition of priorities and targets for the entire budget. We do not agree with the earmarking of appropriations which we know from the outset will not be used. Specifically, we need to identify current expenditure resulting from enlargement. We are hoping to see a real reform of the Commission and a corresponding increase in efficiency. To sum up, we want to fully shoulder the responsibilities we have as a budgetary authority which stem from our very <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>, which is to represent those who elect us. This is what we shall do, whilst stating once more our complete willingness to cooperate in finding the best solutions for outstanding issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, some things are quickly learnt. It does not take an expert on budgets to work out that the Council is submitting a proposal to cut down on posts. The Council is being self-congratulatory while ably wielding the axe. The Dutch Finance Minister, your colleague, recently claimed in public that the European Parliament is the big spender of the two arms of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">If one considers the struggles one faces in the course of the budgetary procedure, he appears to be right. It is true that Parliament often adds a little extra to the proposals of the Council. This is not because it is eager to fleece the taxpayer, but precisely because it wants to be a reliable authority, because it feels obliged to guarantee that the European tasks and responsibilities are actually carried out. Fine words and promises must, however, be translated into action, and that often costs money. I am already anticipating Minister Zalm’s criticism that another parliament building is surely a pure waste of money.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to say to the Council that it should not come and cry on our shoulder now that many of these money-wasting decisions are taken at European summits. Allow me to quote the summit in Nice as an example. During that summit, the participants burnt the midnight oil in meetings to decide whether the Council should have one vote more or less. In order to ease the pain for the losers, Parliament chairs were being handed out lavishly. That, of course, is also telling of how much the Council values Parliament. It is better to have more votes behind closed doors than to have people’s representatives in parliament. This cattle auction will yield us 32 new colleagues, whether we like it or not, and our total number could temporarily even increase to as many as 800. Those members will need assistants and offices, and that was not, of course, taken into account when we first set out to build the current buildings. Do these summits ever stop and consider these issues? For we are left dealing with the implications. I would therefore suggest that at the end of European summits, the political conclusions should be published, alongside a rough estimate of the financial implications. And I would invite the President of the Council to act on this straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns the costs of the Council itself. Within category 5, administrative expenditure, the Council is the fastest growing institution, and that creates added tension within this category. To the Council, the financial perspectives are sacred, and that is why they aim to solve the problem by transferring certain expenses, which they would have gladly included in their own budget, to category 3, such as 3.5 million for Eurojust, and nearly 1 million for Schengen. That limits the scope of the European Parliament to determine its own priorities in this category. But I am an optimist: this situation also has benefits. For in this way, we gain a little more insight and we can indirectly increase democratic control. It does, of course, show where the priority of the governments lies if we are only given this control for the purposes of salvaging the Interinstitutional Agreement and saving some money.</p>
<p class="contents">The reallocation of Eurojust to category 3, however, is not such a clever move. Do not get me wrong, I do not want to include Eurojust in the Council’s budget, but I would incorporate it under the administrative expenditure heading. This, given the nature of expenses, would also be the most logical solution, as the Council also tacitly recognised during the trilogue. I hope that we can at least agree on the principle, namely that operational expenditure belongs in category 3 and administrative expenditure in category 5. Or is the Council perhaps losing its nerve after all, given the increasing number of operational activities in its own budget?</p>
<p class="contents">As already stated, the Council often has a knee-jerk reaction when it comes to deciding to lower the proposed expenditure. What Terry Wynn said is true: we have, after all, suggested a radical overhaul of expenditure, and consideration of what expenditure is still necessary, whether things should be done differently, whether a number of institutions are overlapping in terms of responsibilities, whether there are bureaux that duplicate the work. That has led to a guarded reaction from the Council, which surprises me greatly, for if we want to economise, then surely these are the areas where it can be done. We will also therefore take fresh initiatives to consider radical cutbacks nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Council does like to haggle, and it does not always take the actual needs into consideration in the process. Given the time constraints, I shall only mention one example, namely the Commission’s reform process. That is a priority for us both. Despite this, the Council only approved 89 of the 317 requested posts. You are quite welcome to be critical of the reform process and you need not approve all plans blindly. The repercussions of the schedule for advance resignation now await you. Given the above, I wonder now whether the Council is not simply waiting for us to take responsibility, for then it would, in the final analysis, be Parliament again which is calling for extra funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Thrift is something to be welcomed, but one does need to enable the institutions to carry out their tasks. If not, the citizens of the Union, the taxpayers, will have something to be really disappointed about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
