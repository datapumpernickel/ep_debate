<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, freedom of expression and media pluralism constitute one of the essential foundations of our democratic societies, enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Treaty on the EU settles the common values shared by the Member States and includes pluralism as one additional element to be considered when assessing the implementation of those values.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for media pluralism, protection of journalists’ sources, freedom to criticise private and government powers, independent media and independent regulatory bodies are all essential for the full exercise of freedom of expression, and the Commission is fully committed to the defence of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to recall what is already in place, in particular, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. This refers to the importance of promoting media pluralism in the application of its provisions in six recitals. Moreover, three important elements in the directive strengthen media pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Number one: the promotion of independent TV productions; number two: the right of journalists and news organisations to access short extracts across the EU for the purpose of short reporting; and number three: reference to the need to have independent media authorities at national level, a reference that could only be adopted thanks to the strong support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The transposition period has recently lapsed, and the Commission is now examining the implementing measures that Member States have already notified. It is only after this examination that the Commission will be able to assess the compatibility of those laws with EU law and fundamental rights and to say if any criticism of national legislation is well-founded or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already launched infringement proceedings against 12 Member States that have failed to meet the transposition deadline. More will be revealed in the first application report, due to appear by 19 December 2011. In the meantime, however, if other infringements are detected, the Commission will not hesitate to take the necessary steps, including citing the Court of Justice of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">No gardener pulls up his best young plants just to inspect the roots. The Commission does not intend to propose the revision of a recently amended directive, the real impact of which has yet to be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, spectrum policy is a clear example where the EU can act within its field of competence to enhance competition for the resources on which broadcasters depend, and thereby to strengthen media pluralism. The Commission, as you are aware, is about to adopt a major radio spectrum policy programme to enhance the fair distribution of spectrum across Europe and allow the development of new forms of media to the benefit of media pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, going beyond the specific case of audiovisual media, there are several questions that need to be tackled before any new substantial action is taken in this field. For example, is new EU legislation the real answer to the questions raised by certain national proposals? From the point of view of EU competence, is it possible to identify the internal market problem to be tackled? Is there broad support in Parliament for the substantive approach to be taken, going beyond the specificities of individual national cases?</p>
<p class="contents">All this being said, you are aware that the Commission has organised a study to develop a set of objective indicators to assess media pluralism, related not only to the audiovisual media but also to the written press. We have published that study on our website.</p>
<p class="contents">The question has arisen about what should be the next step with respect to a study, and in that connection, I wanted to let you know that I was waiting to have a proper discussion with you about that matter. The views expressed across the House today will therefore be key input into those reflections, and I will make sure that the College of Commissioners is fully informed and ready to discuss these.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fundamental rights, the Commission has no general powers – as you are aware – to intervene in cases of violations of fundamental rights. However, it would be able to examine respect for freedom of expression and media pluralism in specific cases where a link with EU law could be established. At this stage, and without prejudice to further legal analysis, no such systemic link can be established from the situations in a number of Member States with which I understand certain honourable Members are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the question has arisen as to whether Article 7 of the TEU should be applied to the various Member States in question. As explained in our communication of 15 October 2003 to Parliament and to the Council, Article 7 aims to cover situations which either constitute a serious and persistent breach of values laid down in Article 2 of the TEU or create a clear risk of a serious breach of the latter. In the Commission’s opinion, the situation regarding the media in the various Member States does not fulfil the conditions necessary to trigger the Article 7 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have constitutional traditions which protect fundamental rights. Europe, therefore, cannot replace Member States when it comes to enforcing fundamental rights. However, the Commission will never shy away from dealing with national decisions which infringe EU laws and the common values of the EU and will fully exercise its competences and its role of guardian of the treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank the Commission for the broad approach to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a debate about principles. From my own country, Germany, I can report that one political party, a political power, namely the Social Democrats, owns newspapers and publishing houses, in other words, it has large newspapers under its control. We citizens repeatedly ask ourselves whether it is good for parties to own parts of the media or whether it would actually be better for these two to be separate. Thus, there is a great deal to discuss with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to use today’s debate to talk instead about principles. The media are part of the foundation of our democracy. They inform people of factual circumstances and they scrutinise those who hold power. Of course, this task performed by the media also brings with it a large responsibility to use this power in a responsible manner. In this regard, it is important to protect peoples’ privacy and it is important that news is not reported in order to create a sensation, but to provide reliable information. In that respect, the media are part of the foundation of our civil democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Independence is what is most important here. Publishers must grant their journalists independence. In the national structures that we have – we as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) view this as positive, because the media are also part of our culture – we need independence from political influence, and neither must advertising customers influence the work of editorial staff.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a look at the reality of journalism today, one of the greatest challenges for independent journalism is probably the subject of the Internet, in other words, the ability to access information on the Internet free of charge without knowing whether this information is correct or incorrect. That is a major challenge. In order to maintain high quality journalism, which we need to ensure, even in the age of the Internet, we must uphold the copyright of the journalists who supply high quality work. This is a key challenge for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has to be said that the Union as a whole has so far done little in this area. Less than a year ago, for example, the European Parliament rejected a resolution on inadequate press freedom in Italy, designating it a national matter. However, how can freedom of expression be a national matter when, according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, everyone has a right to freedom of expression and the freedom and plurality of the media must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter is a legally-binding component of the Treaty of Lisbon, and I therefore firmly believe that it is desirable for the Union to act against national interference in freedom of expression and press freedom, whether in the form of attempts to restrict freedom under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, or protecting journalists and the anonymity of sources. A certain level of legislative harmonisation will be essential in this area if we want the Union to promote freedom of expression and press freedom effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is alarming at the moment in Romania, where the security cabinet led by the President of Romania has adopted a political programme document expressing a national strategy in which the media is defined as one of the possible threats to the security of the country. It is important to emphasise that the situation in Romania is in complete conflict with the treaty, with the Copenhagen criteria, and with the Convention on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable in the present day for the executive power of the state to interfere in such a way with freedom of expression and press freedom. We must unequivocally reject this approach of Romania, and call on Romanian Government representatives to amend the national legislation and harmonise it with the fundamental and principle legal documents on which the Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention one example as an inspiration. Only recently, Iceland passed a very progressive law on the protection of news sources and on support for investigative journalists. I see no reason why the European Union should postpone taking similar initiatives for itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are classified as a partly free country by Freedom House and occupy 71st place along with the islands of Tonga, ranking only just above East Timor. The ‘gagging law’ is only the latest development in an overall situation in which the country’s democratic defences are being greatly weakened, in particular, due to the lack of free information.</p>
<p class="contents">As the OECD indicates in its most recent report, the disintegration of democracy and of the vested rights to information and free expression is unfortunately spreading throughout Europe. We need only think of France, with its government-appointed top public television service executive, or Hungary, Estonia and Romania, which, after taking tough legal action to limit freedom of expression, are making it impossible for information to play its essential democratic role as government watchdog.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe it is the Commission’s duty to make a strong, consistent commitment to defending media and information freedom, in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I therefore ask the Commission what action it intends to take to promote genuine media pluralism in the EU Member States and, in particular, when it will issue the communication on indicators for media pluralism, which was promised for 2010, together with the associated legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not like to think that, as with the expulsion of the Roma in France, the Commission is tempted to give up its defence of freedom and democracy in Europe in order to cover up the work of Member State governments, which are increasingly concerned with hiding their wrongdoings from the press and the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you, and also Commissioner Reding, will be able to reassure me on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Was it legitimate for us Europeans to point the finger at Italy and its prime minister Mr Berlusconi, or was it a domestic matter in which the rest of Europe should not have been interfering? In July, the Representative on Freedom of the Media of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) published her report. She did dare to point the finger. The OSCE has done the rounds in Europe and drawn our attention to the following countries. The murder of a blogger, Socrates Giolias, in Greece, the murder of a journalist, Grigorijs Nemcovs, in Latvia, the new media law in Hungary that encroaches on the autonomy of public TV channels and decreases the available media, and the presidential supervision of public channels in France by President Sarkozy. I have just heard something about Romania, and then, of course, there are the latest developments in Italy whereby a law prohibits investigative journalists from reproducing wire tapped materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey, Serbia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina, too – countries with the prospect of joining the European Union – receive reprimands from the OSCE, and rightly so. A big stick remains for these countries, however: membership of the European Union. Freedom of the press is one of our Copenhagen criteria. Therefore, benchmarking is used for accession countries, and it is distressing to see that the European Council does not consider these benchmarks applicable to itself. If it were up to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Italy would indeed lose its voting rights in the Council whilst it persisted in the repression of journalists and whilst everything continued to be in the hands of a single businessman and prime minister.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the subject of media concentration, however, the fact that commercial and public media in Italy are in the same hands is well known, but let us not forget that there are also Axel Springer, Bertelsmann, Rupert Murdoch and, in the Netherlands and Belgium, Christian van Thillo, who owns a very large number of newspapers. A free press is crucial to our democracy, and it is up to the European Commission to present us with a proposal to combat media concentration, precisely because we have to take the OSCE seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Media are for democracy what the bloodstream is for the body. I think this metaphor, taken from the world of medicine, has clear application here. If the circulatory system fails or the bloodstream encounters any obstructions, the body is inevitably weakened and begins to be ill. It is no different with the relationship between pluralism in the media and democracy. If the reliable flow of information fails or encounters obstructions, democracy begins to have problems. This may seem obvious, but perhaps, despite appearances, it is not obvious, since we do not devote as much attention to the problem as it deserves – and this is also true in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time the European Union institutions began to devote much more time to this fundamental problem, and I stress what Mrs Kroes said: ‘this fundamental problem’. We should ask ourselves if we are doing enough, and if the EU institutions are doing enough, to guarantee that the greater part of the media is not concentrated in only a few hands. It is also important that no individual entity be able to control different media operating in different areas, such as television, newspapers, Internet and radio. I think the European Union should do much more to introduce regulations which ensure deconcentration in every area of the media market, and not just television. It should be stressed that the boundaries of free speech in commercial media are often set by the interests of their owners and advertisers. A further danger is that the owners of media who are sympathetic to certain political groupings may favour these groups’ point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">A problem in Poland is that there is a closed media system, as some commentators call it. All the main mass media speak the same way. Journalists who depart from this main trend, who present a different point of view, are given critical write-ups and are sometimes met with smear campaigns and downright attempts to discredit them. There is, therefore, a problem and a great imbalance in the provision of information and opinion – and the provision of information is a foundation of democratic society. I can mention journalists such as Tomasz Sakiewicz, Jan Pospieszalski, Ewa Stankiewicz and Janina Jankowska, because it can be said they have been facing harassment recently in Poland, even though harassment is a strong word. These people have a fine record in the fight for a free and independent Poland, for a free and democratic society, and for free and democratic media. Now, in Europe, we must remember this and do everything possible to achieve real pluralism in the media market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider that there is freedom of speech, but that it belongs to the owners of the media, it belongs to the owners of radio and television stations. It also belongs, to a degree, to those who have a secure income or a secure job. Thereafter, freedom of speech is lost for many thousands or perhaps many millions of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to the Commission that there is a way of increasing the power of journalism. Will a journalist have a job if he disagrees in his report with the owner? Can he take recourse to an agency and seek to exercise his right to freedom of speech, regardless of whether what he says conflicts with what the owner believes? Can we, as the European Union, create such an agency to which a journalist can take recourse, knowing that he will have a job the next day? Obviously, freedom of speech should not depend on a journalist’s ‘bravery’, because there are such brave journalists and well done to them. They are fighters. However, we should work to ensure that all journalists enjoy this freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with a reference to the Internet, which goes to the other extreme. Here, freedom of speech often borders on unaccountability. How can we control who says what, who insults whom, who threatens whom on the Internet, without some sort of control on the ‘freedom’ of the Internet? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Media freedom is more a question of respecting the rights of owners, who determine the content and character of their media, and accordingly also appoint the staff, from chief editor to graphic designer. They deliver the content they think will interest the reader and they produce it at their own discretion. In many cases, today’s media have therefore come to resemble a kind of interest group, which consciously and deliberately attempts to shape public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot expect that the so-called free media will automatically satisfy the right to objective information in respect of the citizen who is a recipient of their targeted output, whether as reader, listener or viewer. It is therefore more important, when it comes to the consistent application of freedom of expression and the unrestricted publication of ideas, to expand the freedom to transmit unaltered information as much as possible, as this contributes towards eliminating the deliberate selection and alteration of information by these free enterprise media.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we should no longer be too worried about misuse of the media by actual government authorities in today’s European Union. Instead, I see a greater risk of potential misuse of information in the media in the excessive concentration of media in the hands of powerful interest groups, and in the media manipulation of public opinion by these groups. I have no great illusions about the freedom of journalists. There is a saying that applies to most of them: he who pays the piper calls the tune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The multicultural elite is putting pressure to bear so that people quite rightly pointing out the threat posed by religions and ideologies are being persecuted. Criticism of religions and ideology is always legitimate. People’s choice to believe in something is taken of their own free will and must not inconvenience others. People are not born into a faith or ideology but embrace it because, for them, it is the truth. Yet it is their own truth; they should keep it to themselves and not inconvenience others with it. As soon as that truth professes to be a universal truth and, what is more, seeks to amend constitutional law, criminal law, civil law and so on, it becomes highly dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism of a person’s ideology or faith must not be subject to persecution in any shape or form. Individual decisions and experiences cannot be above the law. Everyone has the right to cause hurt or offence; it is not always as nice to be on the receiving end, but it is the basis of freedom of expression, as caresses and words of praise do not need safeguarding. Causing hurt or offence is both possible and legitimate. The truth sometimes hurts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, freedom of expression arose in order to protect citizens against oppression by tyrannical rulers. This freedom functions as a way of criticising and making adjustments to the ruling power. It represents an opportunity for ordinary citizens to make their views known to a social elite seeking to impose its particular standards and values on them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, politicians, cartoonists and columnists are being arrested, questioned or charged precisely because they have exercised this right – the right to express their views. The most noteworthy example of this is the absurd political trial against my party leader Geert Wilders. He is being prosecuted because we, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), rightly point out the dangers of the political ideology that is Islam. Islam bears greater responsibility than any other movement or ideology for the loss of freedom of expression in our times. It threatens and intimidates anyone critical of its own socially disruptive nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight for freedom of expression is far from over. The remnants of the tyrannical rulers are still at large in Europe. The PVV would like to see a kind of ‘First Amendment’ in Europe. What is the Commission’s opinion on this? I should like to hear a response from Commissioner Kroes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is nothing wrong with that. However, to maintain that there is a blatant breach of the freedom of expression in the European Union countries is, in my opinion, taking this debate a bit too far. I would like to recall last October’s Parliamentary debate on a resolution which did not get this Parliament’s vote. The resolution’s aim in that particular case was to condemn the Italian Government. In my opinion, the message that this Chamber sent when the resolution was rejected was clear: the only place for these debates is within the national parliaments and they should not be brought before the European Parliament. It is simple; this was the message passed on by this Chamber last October and therefore, I believe that meddling in affairs which do not fall under our competence will diminish, rather than strengthen, the respect that our citizens and electors have for us. Therefore, I very much appreciate the clear way in which the Commission has expressed itself today, in saying that there is no doubt as to the fact that there is no evidence that can suggest any case of a breach of the freedom of expression and of the expression of the media in any European Union country, and I believe that this should suffice to end this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fellow Members, just imagine that the electoral system of this Parliament allows a two-thirds majority to be adopted by a simple majority of votes. And the largest group, that is, the group leader, nominates the President of the European Parliament and then the group elects this nominee through its comfortable majority. Then the group leader nominates and then elects the European Commissioners, the President of the Commission, the President of the Court of Auditors, and the members and President of the European Court of Justice. The Community administration has replaced its leaders without justification. The group leader implements decisions that make it impossible for smaller parties to win an election or even stand for election. And then the group leader – proclaiming revolutionary changes – nominates a loyal cadre to lead the Press Service of the European Parliament and this loyal cadre makes sure that a reliable person is selected to be in charge of each media section. As a result, the public will only hear favourable, positive news about the activities of the group and the group leader.</p>
<p class="contents">This, of course, could not happen in this Parliament. European democracy is built on a system of checks and balances with the media as the ‘watchdog’. Even the existence of a two-thirds majority in Parliament cannot justify the elimination of this system or the restriction of the freedom of the press and freedom of expression. However, this is what has been going on for three months now in Hungary. Since the system of democratic checks and balances is practically gone in Hungary, the watchdog has been poisoned and the poison is starting to do its job; any feedback can only come from European institutions.

I know your personal commitment to freedom and democracy, so I am sure that our press freedom is in good hands with you.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you say that the European Commission has no general powers to protect freedom of the press, but I would say that that is a rather narrow interpretation of your powers, because first of all, protecting democracy and freedom and civil liberties is enshrined in the treaties, and you are the custodian of the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we as a European Union demand from candidate Member States that they meet certain standards, then we may assume that the Commission will protect those standards within the European Union as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element is that media ownership is increasingly a cross-border issue, and we could even imagine that there are non-EU companies who own European media. Would you still say that if, for example, Russian or Chinese owners interfere with European media, it is not our business? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue at stake here is whether we should name and shame, whether we should single out individual Member States. Yes, I think we should. It may be unpleasant, and I would certainly not like my Member State to be criticised, but if we are no longer capable of self-criticism, then how can we protect fundamental rights? I would like to remind Mr Busuttil, my esteemed colleague, that this Parliament, in a previous mandate, adopted a resolution on the Berlusconi Government and freedom of the media that went way beyond the one that was rejected last year. So we do have a precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has repeatedly called for legislation – specific legislation – to give the European Commission the tools to intervene and protect freedom throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The journalists we invited to Strasbourg talked about forms of ostracism used against representatives of the media. The participants of this meeting showed us how freedom of expression is restricted by huge fines imposed by courts for raising uncomfortable historical subjects or defending traditional values, by preventing the distribution of films on uncomfortable subjects such as the causes of the Smolensk air disaster, and by harassment in the form of constant scrutiny of Catholic broadcasters who do not sympathise with those in power. I would like, however, to mention a very spectacular case of the intimidation of an investigative journalist in Poland, who broke down as a result of false accusations made against him. In desperation, he tried to take his life. In a final letter to his children, he wrote that they should not believe the libellous things that were being written about him. This is just one of numerous instances which we noted at the meeting in June. The next meeting of the Reflection Group on Protection of Freedom of Expression will take place on 22 September during the Strasbourg part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The freedom of the press is currently under threat in Europe: it is threatened by the crisis, by media concentration, and by the opportunism of some political leaders. In Italy, any journalist who publishes wire taps can be fined up to EUR 10 000. Mr Berlusconi, who controls five out of six television channels, wants to introduce a law that obliges websites to request government authorisation to reproduce video or audio reports, expanding his control to the new media. In Hungary, attempts are being made to create a media authority controlled by the prime minister. In Romania, the Supreme Council of National Defence – the military – is demanding that the local parliament turn its attention to the phenomenon of defamatory campaigns organised by the media, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is not just a problem of states: it is a problem of companies too. Media concentration is on the increase, as is editorial interference by media owners and proprietors. Commissioner, you said that the Member States have constitutional traditions that protect fundamental rights. However, we in Europe are also building our own constitutional tradition, and we must – for reasons that, as a matter of fact, Mrs in ’t Veld has already mentioned – expand the defence of the freedom of the media to the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some suggestions. We must create means of supporting independent journalists and freelancers: journalists who are currently impoverished and easy prey to pressure from the state or companies. We must expand anti-concentration legislation and we must also, probably, create a fund to support the press that will ensure independence and quality, until a new, Internet-based business model is found in this transitional phase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where it is felt the press is controlled, it is often due to who owns and funds the media. The digital age has seen profits fall rapidly and many companies thrown into financial turmoil, but how can any political body fund the industry without crossing the line of impartiality?</p>
<p class="contents">A leaked letter to President Barroso from the new Commissioner for communications, Viviane Reding, revealed that in order to boost his image, the President will have a photographer and a TV producer on hand 24 hours a day. Not only that, but journalists will be paid to follow the Commission President on foreign trips. Eight staff will even be hired to monitor the blogosphere for criticism and quash whatever unwelcome opinions are found.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, over EUR 8 million was spent on entertaining and training journalists, including EUR 350 000 on coercing Irish journalists during the referendum using so-called Lisbon Treaty seminars. EUR 700 000 has been spent on journalism competitions and at least EUR 7 000 on cocktail parties.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a very fine line between funding the information industry and bribing it.

In these roles, I have experienced two completely different worlds: one viewed from the outside was comparatively independent, the other, now I am involved in politics, is with huge amazement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can prove to you that political reporting in the public media in Germany and Austria is, to a very large extent, controlled by just a few people. For the same ideas that I was at first allowed to support, I was asked to leave the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) as a result of political pressure exerted, for example, on Reinhold Beckmann or Elmar Oberhauser. Where freedom of expression is concerned, we have a much greater problem to deal with than many of us realise. I would ask you also to take a look at the allegedly independent public media, which – when it comes to political matters – is dominated in an extremely one-sided fashion by the two main parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Certain dangers nevertheless still remain. The Commissioner noted that almost half of the countries belonging to the European Union are subject to infringement proceedings to find out whether press freedom and freedom of expression are really guaranteed there. She also highlighted the preventive measures that must be implemented in these areas, emphasising however, that the problem is not specific to one State or to individual States. It is obviously not an Italian problem – Parliament expressed itself on this subject a few months ago by taking a democratic vote – and neither is it a political party problem, because we have just heard that in Germany, it is the socialist group that controls certain media outlets.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem we must face in this Chamber is more general. Tomorrow, we will vote on a report on journalism and new media – creating a public sphere in Europe. This report contains certain guidelines on which our Parliament is beginning to express its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must talk about how to combine truth and freedom in the new media, but also in the more traditional media, because while it is one’s right to tell all, it is also one’s duty to tell the truth when writing or expressing oneself through a media outlet. We must also understand how to combine information with the right of citizens – of all citizens – to privacy.</p>

<p class="contents">I am so shocked that, after the speech made this morning by the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, on the state of the Union and our European projects, we are now debating the state of the media in the EU, and in a number of states in particular: Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Italy. In Italy, granted, there is an incompatible situation between the President of the Council and his position as owner of a media empire which holds a monopoly in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, since you are the guardian of the treaties, I am going to quote to you the following passage from a document. It says: ‘Deliberate press campaigns aimed at denigrating state institutions by spreading false information about their activities pose a vulnerability to the Romanian state.’</p>
<p class="contents">This passage is not part of any Hitlerite or Stalinist policy. It features in a text which will become law if it is adopted by the Romanian Parliament, and has been drafted with the title ‘Romanian National Security Strategy’ on the orders of President Traian Băsescu. I am referring explicitly to Article 6, paragraph 2, point 10, ‘Vulnerabilities’.</p>
<p class="contents">This document, which refers to the challenges facing national security, considers, in fact, that freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, which are otherwise fundamental rights in every EU Member State, actually pose a threat to national security. The wording of this article leaves scope for arbitration and abuse, and damages the reputation of this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to inform you, Commissioner, that two petitions have already been submitted to the European Parliament, and the largest trade union of Romanian journalists, MediaSind, has submitted a petition. You are aware, as I am, that the decision made by the European Court of Justice in 1978, in the Handyside case, is part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is actually part of the corpus of EU treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The trends which have been observed recently in Europe are worrying. In my own country, Romania, the press is no longer regarded as a watchdog monitoring the actions of government and society, but as a vulnerability. A president and government which despise voices of criticism have decided that the press and campaigns which could cause public institutions to lose credibility pose a vulnerability to national security.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if some journalists were to reveal that at the Ministry of Sport or Tourism, for instance, the minister abused public money by spending it irresponsibly or even in a criminal way, this could undermine the ministry’s credibility and, by extension, the government and the country’s national security.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid any accusations, the press should never criticise a public institution again, but keep silent. Does the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights still count for anything? Does the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights still count for anything? Of course they still count, and it is time to put an end to such practices for intimidating the press. Indeed, the European Commission needs to act as a proper guardian of the rights and principles on which the European Union is founded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A month ago, a lawsuit which had been instigated by a powerful media concern resulted in the first auction in a free Poland, and perhaps in the European Union, of a politician’s assets because of his views. The politician concerned is myself, Jacek Kurski, Member of the European Parliament. For making a statement which the Agora concern did not like, a court executive officer auctioned assets of mine for EUR 24 000, which is the equivalent of the annual income of a Member of the Polish Parliament, a position which I held four years ago. It is generally felt that my statement fell within the broadly understood boundaries of political criticism and debate, the sole judge of which should be public opinion and not a court. I have lodged an appeal in this case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but the Agora concern has already sued dozens of prominent Poles for expressing critical opinions about Agora. The particularly scandalous nature of these violations of civil rights stems from the fact that the Agora concern has grown from a party in litigation to become a ‘supercourt’. For it is granted the right to print certain announcements in its newspaper which can ruin anyone if it so decides. Confiscation or auctioning of assets are the norm in Belarus, and were used under Communist rule in Poland. I think the Commission should include this in the position it adopts on this matter.

As the situation stands in many countries of the European Union, there may be freedom of expression and press freedom, but in reality, there are many shortcomings. This is because power has a tendency to make itself felt in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Czech Republic, we have the so-called muzzling act, which makes it impossible to publish information that is disagreeable to politicians, and threatens journalists with harsh punishments, including imprisonment. No other country in Europe has a similar pseudo-democratic legal measure, even though a number of them share the same tendencies. Freedom of expression is also considerably affected by the financial situation of those who work in the media. Whoever has money has power and also influence in the media. The views of the dispossessed are often deliberately ignored. I am not an idealist, and one debate will not put everything right, but the more often we return to this topic, the closer we will get to genuine democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In actual fact, the Commission also guards the Commission’s own secrets so well that it is very difficult for us MEPs, for example, to obtain extensive and, above all, in-depth information about what takes place behind closed doors in your meetings, despite the fact that the Commissioners have not been elected by our peoples and should therefore feel all the more bound to observe their duty of communication and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I am still waiting for an answer – and not the ironic answer I have been given – to my question so that I can circulate the truth in the newspapers. Is or was President Barroso a member of the Bilderberg Club or not? Does he frequent it or not? The answer I was given, and which I published in my press releases, in other words, was as follows: ‘Mr Borghezio, you know more than us about the Bilderberg Group’ is a little odd, and I would therefore like more information on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, what information has the international press given on the background to the financial crisis? The Lisbon strategy was quoted; that is very interesting. It is like looking at a set of Chinese boxes when you come to establish the true owners of the large financial groups to which the leading newspapers and mass media belong; they could be based in tax havens for all we know.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that you would do very well to champion an initiative aimed at really disclosing what goes on behind the scenes of politics, finance and the economy. These are very interesting subjects and have widespread relevance to citizens, who have a right to be kept fully informed. I note, and would emphasise, the silence of the left wing with regard to the Bilderberg Club and the Trilateral Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the Commission acknowledges the important role of a free press in maintaining democratic integrity. However, all too often, the political elite adopt an attitude that words mean what they say they mean. This is one of those cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in this Parliament, an article in the Løkkegaard report called for correspondence from the Brussels press corps to be organised in order to cover EU news in a more instructive manner. Journalists are there to inform, not to instruct. More than anything else, journalists value their independence. If they do not have independence, they cannot be considered free.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission already exerts too much control over the media in Brussels through financial incentive and through coercion. Europarl TV is talked about here as if it had some news value: it does not. Its content is nothing more than press releases with moving pictures. This is why nobody watches it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Løkkegaard report was actually voted through this Parliament today, requiring EU studies to be incorporated into school curricula. Any journalist would tell you there is no place for propaganda in free and independent media. The NGO, Reporters Without Frontiers, has already identified Italy, Bulgaria and Slovakia as having notable problems with their press freedoms. France and Spain also failed to meet the standards that free citizens should have the right to expect. In the UK, we already have a press that can be considered to be free, even if they use ‘allegedly’ a lot. As we have seen here today, the EU seems to be moving in the opposite direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Romania’s case, I am pleased to tell you that neither casting insults nor slander are offences any longer since 2006 as they were removed from the Criminal Code by a right-wing government. This means that no criminal sanction of any kind is imposed on any journalist, not even in the unfortunate situation where false information is being spread in bad faith. Indeed, I think that the situation is great as it is since journalists should not have to live in fear of criminal sanctions. We now have only civil proceedings in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Private press organisations fully exercise their freedom to criticise and challenge those in power, of course, because anyone in power is always criticised. This is only natural.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania, too, has its share of press associations belonging to politicians and funded by politicians and/or businessmen. As we have heard this evening, this happens in many other EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, this affiliation and funding must be transparent. We must also ensure that the editorial independence of journalists who work for such organisations is guaranteed if we want to have a free press. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Bulgaria, like everywhere else, the media work under intense market pressure. Sales are falling, advertising is dwindling and new media are making the boundary between professional journalism and social media increasingly blurred. Other journalists have ever fewer opportunities to practise and carry out their profession normally. Traditional media and their audience are disappearing. For example, it was announced today that one of Bulgaria’s good, quality newspapers, <span class="italic">Klasa</span>, is stopping printing. In this situation, the media become heavily dependent not on their readers but on their benefactors, whether business or government, which are faced with the temptation of swapping media freedom for their own comfort in the media spotlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, a large proportion of publishers in Bulgaria have their main interest in other areas. This creates the prerequisites for pressure and the abuse of editorial policy in return for concessions and good treatment from the government. For its part, the government systematically shows its disregard for the principle of institutions’ independence, including those involved in media regulation. The situation has reached the point where it is deliberately seeking forgiveness in writing from the media after asking them whether pressure was being exerted on them. This, in itself, is a form of exerting pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems in Bulgaria are not unique. They are encountered in other countries too. I would not tar all media with the same brush and would not criticise for a moment either the good journalists who are often forced into working without permanent contracts or, in general, into looking for a change of career. The problem is a structural one. It is basically linked to self-censorship, which is often applied. We must also add to this the concentration in terms of media distribution, whether digital or printed.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the previous team at the European Commission envisaged measures for maintaining and monitoring media pluralism. We particularly need this to happen now. Populism and aggression are very tempting but they have never led to real solutions. I am expecting the European Commission to take an active role at the moment and propose a solution. I am aware that this is a sensitive issue and is often not subject to formal measurement, even though there are such indicators for doing this. In spite of this, the European Parliament must set very high expectations and criteria. The importance of guaranteeing, preserving and developing democracy in Europe is just as high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recommend you read paragraphs 14, 20, 23 and 39 and, in particular, paragraphs 8 and 31. Paragraph 8 says that an EU body is to monitor public media in Europe, and paragraph 31 says that these media have to provide information about our work. We ought to earn the attention of the media and of people by our hard work, not by forcing someone to spread information about our work. The media are not under an obligation to provide information about NATO or the UN and, by the same token, they do not have to tell anyone about the work of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I propose – and I hope we can agree on this – that this debate be held on the basis of objective criteria and objective analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you yourself proposed such an instrument with objective indicators – the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM) – which has been developed by the European Commission. The aim now is for the European Commission, among others, to implement this MPM, and indeed we expect you to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second instrument is the recommendations of the Council of Europe. These recommendations concern standards of press freedom, the independent management of public broadcasters, and stable financing. All 27 Member States of the European Union have subscribed to these standards, and so it is a good idea to remind Member States of the need to meet their commitments on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our responsibility – as the European Parliament – to draw their attention to this. We shall be doing so shortly, among other things, in the form of a new resolution, which concerns the future of public broadcasters in the digital age and which will be presented to this Chamber either next month or the month after. In this, we shall be expressly asking the Commission and also the Member States to look into this in specific terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot accept freedom of the press coming under threat anywhere in Europe, and hence vigilance is called for, vigilance on the part of this House. That is why I think it a good idea that the Commission and Parliament issue the appropriate reminder to the Member States in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows, Commissioner, that it is a keenly-felt problem; it is a major problem in the eyes of the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that, in May 2004, Parliament issued a resolution calling upon the Commission to take action to protect media pluralism and press freedom, but we have not heard the Commission speak up in all these years. As you know, the problem is now growing. The issues concerning Italy, Romania and Hungary are different but their background is the same.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, Italy continues to experience a serious conflict of interest that is exacerbated by government occupation of the public broadcasting service. In Romania, the press is actually considered a threat to the nation. In Hungary, the government wishes to put journalism under scrutiny. The European institutions naturally cannot condone any government influence over the media. Freedom of information is not a commodity that can be evaluated only in accordance with market criteria. Rather, it is the public’s right to form its own opinions about politics, the quality of governments, and public life.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no more excuses for the European institutions; the Commission must take decisive action to reinforce common European standards. Your intervention, Commissioner, could offer European citizens the certainty that Europe is an area of rights and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, Sweden, we have upheld it since 1766, when it became Swedish law, and it is now enshrined in the constitution. Nevertheless, this has not prevented journalists and writers from being subjected to terrible things such as attempts on their lives, fire bombs and threats. This is not unique to Sweden; exactly the same violence occurs elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want Europe to continue to be a model for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, it is unacceptable for three countries in the EU to be identified as only having partial freedom of expression according to the latest report by Freedom House, namely Italy, Bulgaria and Romania. Greece is also reported to have problems. Who does not clearly remember the blank newspaper pages that we saw a while ago in Italy after pressure was exerted on journalists and newspaper editors?</p>
<p class="contents">We must stand up for freedom of speech. We must never forget that freedom of the arts and freedom of expression first saw the light of day in the young European democracies. In any democracy, citizens are free to criticise and form their own opinions about articles and books, and we must never accept a situation in which people are frightened into silence. Freedom of expression forms the very backbone of the union that we are all charged with serving and whose ideals we must stand up and defend, particularly at times when they are challenged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, technological progress, as we have already heard, has created new means of communication. We now have the Internet, we have blogs, we have social networking, we have Internet radio and we have Internet television. These are new media which have made a great impression. I should like to say at this point that a journalist and active blogger was murdered in Greece about two and a half months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Although these new media make a great impression, their operating framework has not yet been regulated in an integrated manner, either legislatively or in terms of a code of conduct. Frequently, our Commission itself replies that we all are relying on self-regulation by these media. It is becoming obvious that, often, as a result of the freedom granted to these media, especially under conditions of anonymity, we end up with abuse and, ultimately, misleading information for the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that, nowadays, publishing and broadcasting are concentrated in the hands of a few, strong, business giants, as an ultimate result of which, businessmen, politicians and often entire governments must bow to the wishes of these giants. To close, it is obvious that often, in the name of freedom of expression, we end up muzzling the political world and muzzling working journalists, who are objectively unable to work and inform their public.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, we know that our powers at European level are limited. Of course, we too are able, for our part, to exert pressure, within a framework and in an environment of broad assent by all the agencies involved, in an environment which will provide immediate solutions for the Member States of the EU coming out of the biggest crisis in the last eighty years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support and agree with those who say that we need to focus on Member States that infringe freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If we have to talk about Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria, we must do so, but if we have to talk about the scandalous case of Romania, we must also do so. We might say that there is no judicial evidence, but there is sufficient information that we must act in response to these scandalous cases because this is not a court but a political parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to point out that there are democratic countries that have public television channels which have succeeded in gaining the highest number of viewers due their pluralism – as is the case in Spain – but which coexist with public television channels of autonomous communities – such as Madrid and Valencia, which have a larger combined territory and population than some Member States – that have been taken over by the respective regional governments and are being significantly manipulated. This manipulation has been reported by associations, parties and unions and involves blackouts and disconnections by the works committees in response to their fears of mobbing. They have shown themselves to be capable – for example Canal Nou – of censoring the greatest corruption scandal in Spain – the Gürtel case – because it affects the government that runs the channel, while the public television channels were running the story as the top headline on that day, and they scandalously violate the rights of journalists and viewers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is happening in the European Union – in the Community of Valencia and the Community of Madrid – and it is happening at Telemadrid and Canal Nou (Canal 9, in Spanish).</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore two television channels – and I promise to provide evidence of this – that are acting outside the Treaty of Lisbon and circumventing the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights because they are constantly infringing Article 11, and I ask you to take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking out to condemn this and I ask the Commissioner and the Commission to ask for information, because a democratic Member State and a democratic Union cannot sustain this type of bad conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Information encourages citizens’ interest in public matters and their participation. We, as politicians, need a level playing field if our various messages are to get a fair public hearing. Unfortunately today, the commercial media are increasingly choosing only to entertain our voters. As a result, they have limited their coverage of current affairs. Thus, it falls to our public media to do more and more in the field of information and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Dangerously, there are some parties and politicians who continue to try to gain control over the public media. This is happening in many Member States – Italy, Hungary, Romania and France, to name just a few. We must resist this trend. Since 1989, the Council of Europe, which has already been mentioned in our debate, has played a magnificent role in setting standards for free and unbiased public media in Europe. These Council of Europe standards must be enforced in all Member States, both in the former Communist East and in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We as a parliament should work more closely with our neighbours here in Strasbourg on this issue. Our Member State governments are responsible for ensuring that public media retain their independence and their ability to provide unbiased information, and we, the European Parliament, should continue to monitor how well they fulfil this public duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We await the definition of the objective indicators for media pluralism with great interest. We await it both as MEPs and as Italians, since we are well aware of the extent to which the pluralism, freedom and independence of the media is guaranteed in Italy. The icing on the cake, therefore, would be indicators that convince the Italian left wing, too, of this, because every four or five months, they put up the same argument, always obtaining a vote that I would suggest is none too favourable to their cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the newspapers in Italy are left wing and they continuously attack the government, producing propaganda for the opposition. For 30 years in Italy, the left wing has occupied and militarily shared out public service jobs in publicly funded state TV, which is a cosy club for centre-left parties. Every day, every week in Italy, public service broadcasts slander the government and the Prime Minister. If, however, some political exponent of the centre-right should occasionally make the mistake of questioning the newspapers, a cry goes up that freedom of information is under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else also happens in Italy: telephone wire taps obtained during legal investigations are regularly published, even when they have nothing whatsoever to do with the investigation. This practice spreads information and infringes citizens’ privacy to such an extent that, a few years ago, the ladies and gentleman of the left protested against this practice. In June 2007, Massimo D’Alema said: ‘The sight of solicitors copying down what has been said and then going to the journalists is indecent, it is like an Arab souk.’ In March 2007, Antonio Di Pietro said: ‘The use of wire taps should be regulated, and penalties imposed to safeguard privacy.’ In February 2008, Walter Veltroni said: ‘The Democratic Party supports an absolute ban on the publication of wire taps until the preliminary hearing is over.’</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the Italian Government today dared to propose a law to parliament that also regulates the right to privacy and imposes penalties on those who infringe the law on the publication of wire taps, the entire left-wing press would be up in arms shouting that it is a scandal, and this would be strongly echoed by the usual ultra-left-wing voices in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Some left-wing newspapers have been published like this; they have left the front page blank to protest against the gagging law. Only the first and second pages have been left blank, however, because they have published adverts, as usual, on the back page. We therefore advise this left wing, which cannot make up its mind and tells us every six months that freedom of information does not exist, to put its mind at rest and find something more serious to talk about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far this evening, I have heard confused accounts, veiled allusions and, unfortunately, accusations.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, allow me to provide you with reliable information about the new Hungarian Media Act. All political parties agreed that the 1996 Act was very much outdated. The new government submitted its draft media law package to the Hungarian Parliament in order to create a clear structure and transparent financial foundations for media regulations. How is the government trying to achieve this? For instance, by preventing wasteful expenditure of state funds. By solving structural issues. By making the media system transparent. By what means? By reducing the number of party-appointed members to one-fifth. Or even by making the national media and telecommunications authority accountable to Parliament. Or by declaring the freedom of the press and protecting the independence of journalists. Or even by ensuring the confidentiality of sources used by investigative journalists, while protecting fundamental constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in the meantime, it may happen that the interests of the previous government will suffer. Some may even start malicious rumours. The truth is that the submission of the act was preceded by a lengthy process. Also, the act is not final yet, as the parliamentary debate on it will only start next week. The European Commission has a great responsibility. This issue must be taken seriously and it is also true that, as was mentioned, a uniform, transparent and reliable assessment is necessary. Unclear accounts and allusions are dangerous and have a detrimental effect on nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The right to information, and access to information, accompanied by a multiplicity of sources, are at the heart of the democratic process. This allows citizens to form their opinions freely, and allows the media to make sure that they can play the role of partners in the dialogue which takes place between citizens and those in power.</p>
<p class="contents">What characterises the media, then, is their neutrality, objectivity and precision. Yet in my country, Bulgaria, it was not long ago that the media and the press served the aims of an ideological regime which we all condemned in 1989. Twenty years later, the legacy is here, advances have been made, and it is important that there are warnings to allow us to remain vigilant and not to turn our attention away from the essentials.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address three points here. First, making sure that freedom of expression and freedom of the media are guaranteed. However, this is a process with a double meaning. Freedom must not damage the freedom of others. Building and working on a framework of mutual confidence and respect seems to me to be an important element of relations between the media and individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, in their role as the ‘fourth power’, the media ensure democratic control. However, this control must be accompanied by verification of sources and by transparency, which will avoid the exploitation of the media for corporate, commercial, economic or political ends. Reliability of sources, transparency with respect to the income of media proprietors, and objective dissemination of information can only lead to progress for our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must bear in mind the role of journalists. Respect for professional ethics, independence and respect for fundamental freedoms are valuable indicators for all journalists who see themselves as professionals. Preventing standardisation and combating over-information, which often has regrettable consequences, are objectives which today’s media must pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, freedom does not include submission. This is why submission to the laws of audience ratings, large monopolies, depoliticisation of important subjects and over-politicisation of subjects concerning society are contrary to the role of the media as vectors of free information, liberated from all interests other than the common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has set a record that is almost unbeatable. Roughly 6 000 journalists have been made redundant in the Romanian press so far, with many publications closing down.</p>
<p class="contents">How has this managed to happen? It is a result of intimidatory actions by those in power, such as press campaigns declared as posing a vulnerability to national security, and of the action of the Romanian Government to make all media employees, who are badly paid, to pay additional taxes. There is also another aspect, also noted by the General Secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, Aidan White, and I quote: ‘Romanian journalism is under siege from the country’s economic woes and employers’ greed.’</p>
<p class="contents">The future of this profession is in serious peril. Employers and the authorities must adopt measures immediately to save professional journalism. Only action taken at EU level can still save the press in Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this debate, we have heard examples from across Europe of bad practice. In my country, the UK, we have excessive media ownership by News International, by Rupert Murdoch. If a politician seeks power, they do not tend to rock the boat by challenging that too much.</p>

<p class="contents">Still, I am grateful for all your interventions: I am aware that, on that score, I have beaten the President with his State of the Union speech this morning. There have been so many interventions tonight, and again I am grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to your interventions. This is indeed freedom of expression, and I am grateful to be in a Parliament that not only tolerates freedom of expression outside, but also defends it in its own House.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we do have a lot in common. We are both – and not only the Commission – the guardians of the treaty, so it is right that we are having the debate here and that we should be quite frank with each other in inferring what should be at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, with many of the Members of Parliament who took the floor tonight, I could not resist wondering which most of your countries are, those that you claim to know best. Indeed, one of the issues that I am touched by is that quite a number of Members of Parliament are from young democracies, and I think that is a warning.</p>
<p class="contents">You have been fighting for freedom of expression and you have been fighting for media pluralism, and we should all take that lesson into account, which is that you do not take something like that for granted but that you have to defend it, and if that is not passion, then I would love to have a drink with you after this session and find out what your definition of passion is.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would also like to underline that what Sofia in ’t Veld was mentioning is indeed true. I am really an open book on this matter and I am proud to be an open book. That does not mean that it is always possible to do it 100% your way, for we are indeed finding out what is the best in Europe and what is the best way we could take.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to conclude tonight’s debate, the Commission would like to recall that the new Article 2 of the Treaty on the EU enumerates in its first sentence the values upon which the Union is founded, which Member States must respect and which Member States must promote. These are: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Member States are obliged to respect those values. I am absolutely certain that no one at this plenary session is against that line, for otherwise you would not be a Member of this Parliament, and the list contained in the first sentence of that article is not only declaratory but also assumes two concrete aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First, respect for those values and the commitment to promote them in common at EU level are two conditions for accession to the EU as provided for in Article 49 of the TEU and, exactly as some of you mentioned, when we are just judging if a would-be Member State is able to join the family, that is also a matter for those who have already joined the family.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the violation of those values can trigger the warning and sanction procedure provided for in Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">The operational nature of the list of values explains its brevity. Only the most important underlying values with a well-defined legal content have been listed. Conversely, in the second sentence, Article 2 explains the characteristics of the European model: pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men; and those characteristics help the application and the interpretation of those values.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be difficult at this stage if the values stated in Article 2 were to be in imminent danger as a result of the events evoked today. I do not think that these situations have any cross-border dimension which could justify any intervention from our side at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, and myself, in particular, as vice-president in charge of the digital agenda and the media, will remain vigilant and will defend press freedom, media pluralism, the right of journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources and the capacity of the media to investigate corruption and the abuse of power.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider quality and investigative journalism, written press and news media to be an important feature of European political culture and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me just say that I really am looking forward to the report by your rapporteur, which was mentioned by Ivo Belet. I am well aware of the developments concerning your report, and I welcome it very much and look forward to the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, finally let me assure you that I have listened carefully to all of you, and as I reflect on the next steps with my colleagues, I am ready to continue this debate with you, so I am looking forward to coming back and continuing this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In an information society such as ours, however, it is becoming increasingly evident that independence does not mean the absence of any rules and that pluralism is not a sufficient value. The power of the media in an information society is really a public power which Montesquieu, were he alive today, would have tried to balance against the other powers: legislative, executive and judicial. These three traditional powers must also be independent, but a reciprocal limit is established between them. As far as I can see, this problem has not been examined in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">I will restrict myself to making two remarks. Journalists’ right to freedom is a human right that is at least equal to the right to dignity and privacy of every citizen. A duty of checks and balances therefore also exists. Judicial power must be transparent, but certain investigations must be absolutely secret during the initial stages if the truth is to be uncovered in the interests of justice and, therefore, ultimately of the public. I believe that these two aspects are always neglected in our debates. By making this speech, I have attempted to leave some record of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of the day, this is a fundamental right, codified in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 11). I would also like to say that, since last year, there has been an unofficial European Charter of Press Freedom, welcomed by the Commission, in which journalists demand that governments of European countries abide by principles protecting them and their work, ranging from the prohibition on censorship to ensuring the personal protection of journalists. In my opinion, however, that is only one side of the overall problem. The other side is the ever-growing brute power of the media, the wholesale flouting of basic ethical standards by journalists, their lack of responsibility for the freely spoken word and their pseudo-independence which is determined by the financial and political interests of the media barons. Virtually the entire press in the Czech Republic, from regional to central, is owned by foreign concerns which meddle in the politics of the country in an unscrupulous manner through their media. Does this interest any of the competent persons in the EU? I doubt it. We will just carry on coining fancy slogans and phrases while reality takes its own course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority of Members support democratic values and the opportunity for everyone to have their say about problems and the people who cause those problems. However, there are occasions when journalists chasing after cheap sensations forget about professional ethics. Then there are instances when, in return for pay, journalists are ready to commit libel and grossly interfere in other people’s personal lives. We must discuss not only occasions of coercion of the press but also the responsibility of every individual for libel and defamation. There is a Russian proverb: ‘The only thing worse than death is loss of one’s good name’. That remains the basic principle for many people even today. That is why I offer the following approach to the concept of a ‘journalist’: 1) the name of ‘journalist’ should be reserved for those who have not besmirched this high calling by using untruthful materials paid for by third parties; 2) to arrive at a definition for those people who engage in black PR; 3) to stress that freedom of expression does not include freedom to defame and freedom to libel; 4) journalists must be worthy of the high calling of ‘member of the fourth estate’. Otherwise, all resolutions and all reports on press freedom are a mere farce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, reality – unfortunately – is rather different. Freedom of expression, and press freedom in particular, are under threat and will soon only exist on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, for example, the statements by the German <span class="italic">Bundesbank</span> board member, Thilo Sarrazin, regarding the failure of Muslim immigrants to integrate have led to a campaign by the politically correct guardians of virtue, although the majority of what the German, Mr Sarrazin, said is true and is confirmed by statistics and by everyday observations. People are even going as far as calling for the Social Democrat to be relieved of his office. Thus, anyone who expresses an undesirable opinion will have his civil existence annihilated – a form of behaviour that we are actually used to seeing in dictatorships.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other dangerous threats to freedom of expression and press freedom in the European Union, led by the so-called Fundamental Rights Agency: only positive reports are to be made about immigrants, and problems such as abuse of the asylum procedure or crime committed by non-nationals should – because they contradict the publicised multicultural idyll – be kept quiet as far as possible. If, as in Sweden, a private television broadcaster refuses to broadcast an advertisement for a right-wing democratic party during an election period on account of an alleged anti-Muslim sentiment, then this is not only an act of self-censorship, but it is also the manipulation of an election. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Relations between the European Parliament and the media have always been very complicated and it is of paramount importance to find a balance in these relations so that both sides can carry out their job effectively. I would like to thank Mr Løkkegaard and his colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education for accepting my two proposals on facilitating the accreditation procedure for journalists in Brussels (paragraph 24), as well as my second proposal concerning the importance of private radio and TV broadcasters which, along with public radio and TV broadcasters, are a key resource for EU news coverage and can assist in the development of information flow in Europe (paragraph 26), making it more accessible to citizens. I believe that European institutions have work to do in order to facilitate accreditation for journalists in Brussels and to contribute to better cooperation between public and private radio and TV broadcasters. This will allow us to increase the awareness on the part of European citizens about the European institutions’ work and policies.
