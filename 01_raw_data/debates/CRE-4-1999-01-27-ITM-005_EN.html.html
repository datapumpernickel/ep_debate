<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bernard‐Reymond </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR) </span> Mr President, China, an immutable yet changing country, has once again recently given us an example of its contradictions and its difficulties. Having shown encouraging signs of opening up on human rights issues, a series of hurried trials have just reminded us – as if there were any need to be reminded – that unfortunately this country remains hostage to an authoritarian policy that shuns freedom, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months, there have been several encouraging signs such as the signing of two UN conventions on economic, social and cultural rights and on civil and political rights, the fact that there has been indirect contact with representatives of the Tibetan people, the Taiwanese representative"s visit to Peking, the freeing of political prisoners, the troika"s visit to Tibet, the fact that Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, visited Beijing, and the public dialogue between the United States and Jiang Zemin which took place on Chinese television.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, not so naïve as to think that, in themselves, these things all constitute a bold new policy, but the simple fact that they took place and the fact that the authorities in Beijing deemed them necessary, was, in itself, an incentive to continue and extend dialogue. It was in this context that the Commission decided to draw up a new communication, which the Council has approved before Parliament has even given its opinion on it – hardly a good example of democracy to show China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has adopted five guidelines that you already know about and that have been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy. I note with satisfaction the fact that these guidelines make political dialogue a priority, along with proposed aid to China to help establish the rule of law in compliance with international requirements. We need to maintain political dialogue with this future major actor in the multipolar world, a power that could act as a stabilising influence in that region of Asia. But political dialogue is equally necessary in order to persuade China that the key to becoming part of international society lies in the respect of universal values. In view of this, we welcome the legal and judicial cooperation programme put forward by the Commission, providing a total of ECU 13 million over four years. In this programme, respect for individual and trade‐union freedoms should be made a priority, even though the legal security of economic society is also necessary, particularly as regards protecting investments and intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, we are considering these guidelines at a moment when Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin have once again been imprisoned, and where a wave of arrests and trials forces us to ask just what this crackdown means. Of course, we know that the prospect of the tenth anniversary of the events in Tiananmen Square is worrying Beijing, but we fear that the roots of such a hardline stance go much deeper than that.</p>
<p class="contents">On an economic level, China is undergoing major change. Having learned from international developments over the past twenty years, from the development of globalisation and the efficiency of the market economy, China has decided to open up to the world and move from a centralised and bureaucratic economy to a socialist market economy. It has rapidly reaped the benefits of this change. For a long time now growth has been 10 % or more, currency reserve levels have been high, foreign investment has increased considerably, external trade is in full expansion and inflation is gradually being brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to support this trend by offering to cooperate in such diverse fields as human resources development, administrative reform, social protection, reform of the financial sector, combating poverty and regional disparities, the transfer of technological know‐how in the energy sector, widening scientific and technical cooperation and protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as always, these sweeping changes have also exacerbated or created major disparities: between town and country, between coastal regions and the interior, between Beijing and local authorities, between the poor and the newly rich, between those in and out of work, and in environmental matters. The authorities" desire to overcome these difficulties without endangering China"s unity and whilst preserving its internal stability is justifiable but does the path which the Beijing authorities appear to have chosen not increase the danger rather than avert it?</p>
<p class="contents">A changing society needs flexibility, decentralisation, accountability, initiative, debate: in short, democracy. Anything that is inflexible, authoritarian and centralist may fool people for a while, but in a changing economic society such an attitude always leads to obstacles being created, which in turn will trigger explosions or lead to that society being ostracised and isolated. Although Europe is still willing to enter into constructive dialogue, it does not want China to follow any of these roads. Europe would like China to gradually become part of international political and economic society. We are prepared to help it to reach this goal. However, China must be capable of being as courageous in the political world as it has been in the economic world. We strongly encourage China to do this as we know that, for all peoples, freedom is the future of history.</p>

The neo‐liberalist doctrines of the IMF have been unsuccessfully applied to all three, that is to say, South‐East Asia, Russia and Brazil. Now it would appear that China is to be the next target of assault by international market forces. China is nevertheless a politically more stable fortress that the other countries I have referred to. Its stability could be vital for the whole world, including Europe and the United States. If China"s currency is devalued, European and American competition will not stand the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bernard‐Reymond"s report rightly stresses the importance of a constructive but unconditionally critical attitude towards Chinese society. China is crumbling from within as a result of environmental problems. Its population is predicted to grow to one and a half billion quite soon. When subject to rapid intensive and extensive economic growth, nature and the environment become vulnerable. 80 % of China"s energy is produced from coal, the country relying on exports for other sources of power. Burning coal in China adds to the world"s carbon dioxide emissions, and China produces more emissions than any other country in the world apart from the USA. China, however, is not bound by an international agreement on climate, and, as a developing country, does not have to be. It would be in its own interests, however, to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report fails to discuss environmental problems thoroughly enough, and hardly at all, in fact. The Committee on External Economic Relations has focussed its attention on these problems, which the rapporteur has largely ignored. The sale of modern technology that protects the environment and innovative products that incorporate environment‐friendly technological know‐how would be an important growth industry for companies in the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dupuis </span> <span class="bold">(ARE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the picture painted by the rapporteur, Mr Bernard‐Reymond, clearly illustrates the failings of the so‐called constructive dialogue policy which the European Union has pursued with China for many years now.</p>
<p class="contents">He has highlighted all the shortcomings, or some of them at least, and the whole thing really is a failure of major proportions. It must be pointed out that the Union and the Member States showed the same condescending attitude towards the citizens of the Soviet Union, who it was felt did not count as such. For years, we believed that what worked for us, namely democracy, was something that did not apply to them, and for some time now we have been applying the same analysis to China. We have been following the same policy of not acknowledging that Chinese citizens, like us, have a right to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly serious as the situation in China is much more desperate than we are often told. Tens of millions of people are unemployed due to social and economic contradictions. Contrary to what people would have us believe, it is not the communist system – and this is indeed the issue here – that will guarantee the stability which our socialist colleague was discussing, but rather democracy, with its safeguards, its opposition forces and its social control mechanisms. Only democracy could help China to rid itself of such contradictions once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be better to push China, to demand that it and its leading communist class relinquish their monopoly on power, their violent monopoly over tens, even hundreds of millions of people. Such violence is the reason behind the tens of thousands of political prisoners – and these are official figures. I would ask everyone to consider for a moment the conditions in which individual political prisoners are today being held in China, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Turkestan. We forget about them, we listen to dissidents when they are released from prison and we applaud them, but we forget that tens of thousands of other political prisoners are being subjected to violence and torture and very often killed, even as we debate this report here today.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the policy of constructive dialogue with the People"s Republic of China that the European Union is endorsing and it is a disaster. We have seen examples of such a policy with the Russian loans at the beginning of the century, and even if the situation is not entirely comparable I believe that, as far as our businesses are concerned, we should perhaps be slightly concerned at the risk to the high levels of capital invested by firms from the Member States of the European Union, which are in danger of waking up tomorrow to find themselves in a situation of unprecedented confusion in the face of enormous losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Next door to China is the world"s largest democracy: India. The European Union acts as if it has forgotten that this country and this great democracy exists and that at least there we can count on the ruling democratic classes there. But no, we dig our heels in, we head straight for China and we forget these other examples. My socialist colleague mentioned the Asian tigers but he forgets that South Korea, following the recent economic growth crisis, has further developed its democratic institutions. He forgets that democracy in Taiwan, which is a Chinese country, is working better and better. He forgets the positive examples but he also forgets about North Korea, a vassal of the People"s Republic of China. In a few years" time, when the North Korean regime has fallen from power because, for one reason or another, there is no longer any support from the international community, we will discover that there were millions of deaths in North Korea, and we will act as if we are surprised by this.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the sorts of regimes we are encouraging with our constructive dialogue policy. We have not seen any progress in the People"s Republic of China. The rapporteur pointed out that international conventions have been signed, yet a few weeks after they were ratified new dissidents were arrested and sent to the notorious ‘laogai", the Chinese concentration camps. We saw young Chinese people being arrested for surfing the Internet. This is the China we wish to support and for which we are providing de facto support with this constructive dialogue policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Sir Leon Brittan is here with us, as Parliament"s policy used to be rather different, as shown in its urgent resolutions. No fewer than twenty resolutions have been tabled over the past five years, calling, in particular, for the release of dissidents. None of them was released as a result of pressure from Europe. Two or three were released due to pressure from America, namely Wong Dan and Wei Jingsheng, but we achieved nothing. Mr Hada, the democratic leader of Inner Mongolia, is still in prison, as are the dissidents from Eastern Turkestan, and as are tens of thousands of political prisoners. We do not have a High Representative of the European Union for Tibet, as Parliament has requested. We have achieved nothing here either for human rights or for political freedoms.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I would make it clear from the beginning that the Socialist Group is in favour of the Commission's communication about building a comprehensive partnership with China. We emphasise the word partnership which is about dialogue between two parties not one party constantly lecturing another. As Mr Bernard‐Reymond is aware, my initial concern at his first draft report was that we were spending most of our time lecturing China. I would like to thank him and pay tribute to him for the way he has been prepared to take on amendments and adapt his report. I feel it is now a far better balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">China is, of course, important, not just to the EU but to the world, as we saw when everybody was trembling at the prospect of a devaluation of the currency. That does not, of course, justify us ignoring our own traditional positions. We have our own standards and our own beliefs in relation to democracy and human rights and we are quite entitled to express those and expect our partners to respect the same principles. However, we have to recognise that changing a system is not easy and that China in many ways is actually a developing country, not a developed country.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we should be looking to encourage progress and reform. Mr Dupuis is right. The political and economic reforms go together. They are not isolated from each other. Sudden dramatic about‐turns, such as those we had with the Cultural Revolution in China, do no good to anybody. They disrupt and increase poverty. We should be prepared to recognise when China is moving in the right direction, for example, the transition to Chinese rule in Hong Kong has gone far better than most people ever expected and we should recognise that. We should be trying to encourage China to take its place in the world system, particularly its membership of the WTO. That will allow us then to get to grips with issues like counterfeiting and lack of respect for intellectual property, which are major concerns for us at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, of course, be constantly driving home the message of human rights but we have to recognise that access was given to Mary Robinson and that China has moved towards taking on board the UN conventions. We need to ensure these are ratified and we are quite right to condemn the recent crackdown which goes against the trend we have seen in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be aware when criticising China that we ought to be looking at ourselves. We must speak as the European Union with one voice in our relations to China. It is no good one or two Member States deciding to go it alone for trade reasons. The European Union has to have a common policy in relation to China.</p>
<p class="contents">My final observation is in relation to Taiwan. I am glad we were able to change the report's comments on relations with Taiwan because, while we should not interfere in the relationships between Taiwan and China, our position should be very simple. Any solution to Taiwan should respect international law and the right of self‐determination. Beyond that, of course, it is a matter for the Chinese to resolve.</p>

We believe that only through constructive dialogue can we make progress. In reply to Mr Dupuis I would say that I share many of his views, but none of our urgent resolutions did any good. We must begin a constructive dialogue and strengthen it, and I hope the other side, the People"s Republic of China, understands that we are willing to meet it halfway if it does the same for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides bear a great responsibility. Firstly, the European Union would like and hopes to see the People"s Republic of China take the necessary domestic steps to enable it to become a member of the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible. We are also quite prepared, if it so wishes, to support the People"s Republic of China in achieving its own objectives, to support it in transforming its economic system from a bureaucratic planned economy into a socialist market economy. Above all, we believe that in the interests of trade and investment the approach taken by the People"s Republic of China must lead to reforms of the legal and taxation system, otherwise world trade cannot continue to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">Signing the UN conventions does not suffice for the development of human rights and democracy and we should tell our friends quite clearly that as we see it the principles of democracy and human rights also require the recognition of, in particular, political parties of a different tendency, the recognition of the cultural autonomy of regions such as Tibet, the civil rights of the individual and the release of persons imprisoned because of the exercise of their civil rights. This message should in fact have got through today too.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make one more comment on the subject of peace and stability in Asia. Recognition of the existence of the State of Taiwan and of the rights of its citizens to self‐determination is a fundamental condition for stability there. The talks between the representatives of the People"s Republic of China and of Taiwan are promising signs that both sides are moving towards a peaceful solution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cars </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the Swedish writer Per Ahlmark has collaborated with a number of famous peace researchers in different parts of the world to show, quite convincingly, that democracies never go to war with each other and that disasters causing hunger over a wide area do not occur in countries which have a free press and market economies. In the twentieth century, the victims of dictatorships can be reckoned in their millions. The dictators have driven these people out in time of war, they have executed them, degraded them in concentration and labour camps, or starved them to death. Among the most notorious mass‐murderers of our time are Hitler, Stalin and Mao, but others have existed – and still exist – who are their equal in many respects, among them Pol Pot, Verwoerd, Saddam Hussein and Kim II Sung, to mention but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mao's time, China has made considerable progress. In Europe, we welcome this and share in the happiness of hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are enjoying better lives as a result. But the people of China still have enormous problems to contend with. China is still far from being a democracy; there is little room for freedom of speech or to form trade unions. Those who have called for democracy and human rights in China have been given long prison sentences. Executions are common, the Tibetans are oppressed and Taiwan is subject to blatant threats from Beijing. So long as this situation continues, it is the duty of the European Union and of this Parliament in particular to call for change and to use all the means at our disposal to bring it about. It is in our interests, but to an even greater extent it would be in the interest of China and its people too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ephremidis </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the communication by the European Commission, and by extension, I think, the debate as it is taking place, seem somewhat ignorant of history. They have no basis in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not prepared to take any account of the fact that China, that great country, that great nation, emerged only 50 years ago from foreign wars, from a status of prolonged colonialism, from civil wars, and within 50 years it is striving to create its own model, one which matches its history, its culture, which goes back 5 000 years before our debate today. That is why the Commission's statement is of questionable credibility, it is presumptuous, self‐interested in its objectives, it aims to explore how, through what loophole and by what artifices European multinationals can take part in the sharing of the enormous cake represented by the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the statement doing? I have no time, so I will try to mention only a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">At one point, the statement mentions continuing reforms which we will assist. If that were sincerely aimed at China's development, at the prosperity of its people, we should all be in agreement. No such thing! The real aim is to establish reforms which will draw China in and subject it to your own model and to the standards dictated by your multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, the statement speaks of assisting the reforms in order to forestall crises in China such as those in other Asian countries. But, ladies and gentlemen, those countries – the three you referred to earlier – had long been immersed up to the neck in your own models and liberal measures. And yet the crisis still occurred. Is that where you want China to go as well? Has there not been a crisis in your own countries too, despite unrestrained liberalism? Where are you looking for the causes of the crisis and seeking reforms according to your own models, supposedly out of concern, in case China suffers a crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">And another thing which means an attempt to intervene in China's internal affairs: yes, let us have bilateral trade, but where this concerns Chinese enterprises which, inside China, do not conform absolutely with the rules of the free market, then we must adopt special dumping measures against them. That is blatant and inadmissible intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the rule of law, democracy and so on, so that we can have ‘partnership" and close relations with China. That, of course, would be a very good thing for the Chinese people, for the European Union and from an international perspective. But why are you closing your eyes? The rather small country of Latvia, with which you have very close relations and which you are striving to bring into the Community, has 700 000 inhabitants out of 2.5 million who do not have the right to call themselves citizens, who have no rights at all. Why? Because they suffer the sole disadvantage of being Russian‐speaking. Why do you want such relations with them? Why can you not see that? This, then, is hypocrisy, self‐interest and presumption. One of the speakers even said that you aspire to teach them.</p>

China wants a share in the economic leap forward in the global economy, but is not yet prepared to accept the consequences of that as far as shifting its political position is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy and respect for human rights are managed from a position of fear. The rapporteur actually uses the word ‘authoritarian". In practical terms, for example, we see the founder of the Democratic Party of China receiving an eleven‐year prison sentence. It is all a little game they play. On the eve of the American visit and the talks of the International Olympic Committee, the dissidents are released. A few weeks later, a large number of other dissidents are imprisoned again.</p>
<p class="contents">They are playing games with the rest of the world – games which do not sit well with the comprehensive partnership envisaged by the Commission. They are not compatible with that. I think they are frankly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that all the European Member States are queuing up to do business with China. But I totally agree with Mr Dupuis. These investments can only be successful if China becomes an open and democratic society. Our partnership can be helpful here. The rapporteur suggests a constructive dialogue, but that has to lead to meaningful economic and political measures. Otherwise, I can see Parliament pursuing a constant debate on constructive dialogue which achieves nothing, as we saw before in our critical dialogue with Iran. Constructive dialogue has to result in progress. The rapporteur"s suggestion that a human rights clause should be included in the trade and cooperation agreement with China which is now coming up for renewal is a step in the right direction. My congratulations to the rapporteur.</p>

That is why I, as chairman of the delegation for relations with China, together with other members of the delegation and numerous colleagues, have tabled a separate amendment in which we not only express our concern, but also call for concrete information from the Chinese authorities regarding the large number of people who have been arrested recently. It is vital that we continue to exert pressure on the Chinese Government and do not allow them to believe that we only see the positive developments. Of course we cannot do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are the Chinese people behaving in this way? The situation in China is certainly very serious. I should like to quote the French professor, Jean‐Louis Rocker, writing in the report of the annual conference organised by the European Union – China Academic Network, which took place last week in Madrid: ‘In recent years numerous demonstrations, petitions, sit‐ins and violent actions have taken place in most big cities in order to protest against the degradation of living conditions'. There is a feeling of social unease in China which the authorities harshly suppress. There is good reason for the European Union to reconsider its policy towards China.</p>

He has drafted a very good report. We have had a number of discussions and draft amendments and I believe that has resulted in a very balanced report. As Members we are in an extremely difficult situation in regard to China. I could quote Mr Gorbachev, who said ‘life punishes latecomers", but perhaps China would find that rather difficult to accept given the man who said it and against the background of the fact that the Soviet Union disintegrated in a manner that was not exactly positive and that it would be a disaster for China and the world were history to repeat itself in this regard. That is precisely why we must remain in continuous dialogue with the Chinese and with the representatives of China and convince them that it is important for them, for China, to carry out the appropriate reforms and that this is not being forced upon them from the outside but forms part and parcel of the democracy movement in China.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we must consider three important issues, the political, the economic and the human rights issue. Let us not be naive enough to believe we could eliminate any of these. Let us not be naive enough to believe we could fight for human rights unless we continue the political dialogue at the same time and also support and promote the economic development of China. China is an important partner and it is precisely those who keep saying that we need the United Nations and the Security Council for security policy measures and decisions in the world who must conduct this political dialogue with China, even in China"s present, unhappy political form.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to the economic question, of course I know that a number of undertakings have purely economic or trade interests. But our common objective is the progress of economic development in China. It cannot be in our interest to see China collapse; on the contrary we want China to develop economically. Our policy and that of the European Union must be that at the same time – not as an alternative or substitute for that objective – we remain unyielding on the human rights issue and endeavour to persuade China to make progress with political democracy, in its own interests and in the interests of human rights. For however many mistakes Mr Gorbachev made, those words are crucial. They apply for China too and in the case of China they could have far‐reaching, disastrous results and consequences for the whole world: life punishes latecomers!</p>
<p class="contents">China will be the first to be punished if it does not try in good time to make parallel progress in the economic, political and human rights fields. That is why I so much endorse what the report is now endeavouring to do: it is trying to approach China through dialogue, rather than prescribing from above in a kind of imperialist manner how China should conduct itself; instead China is being invited to join with us in making the world a better, fairer and economically more successful place.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, Mr Bernard‐Reymond's report constitutes a valuable contribution to the on‐going and evolving debate about the nature of the relationship between China and the European Union. It is important that we engage in a positive and constructive relationship with China. However, it must be an open and honest relationship. The European Union has consistently supported the principles of democracy and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">While we want to be positive about many of the changes that are taking place in China, we cannot, and indeed must not, turn a blind eye to the continuing abuse of human rights, in particular the scandalous treatment of political dissidents and members of religious faiths. Failure on our part to speak out simply because many of the leading Member States of the European Union have profitable trading relationships with China would be an abdication of our responsibility and would undermine the moral authority of the Union to speak on other situations elsewhere in the world where human rights are being blatantly breached. Furthermore, it would be a betrayal of the philosophy of the founding members of this Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Hong Kong is concerned, I welcome the fact that the handover has taken place without many of our worst fears having been realised. However, we must continue to keep a watching brief on Hong Kong and I welcome the publication of the Commission's recent report in that regard to which I hope we will be able to respond. There have been a number of instances where the independence of the rule of law and the observance of human rights have been called into question. These fears must be addressed as must also the wish to see the introduction of an accelerated timetable for the introduction of universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">With these few comments, I commend the rapporteur's efforts and I very much welcome the report he has produced.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Madam President, Mr Bernard‐Reymond's report indicates that there is no reasonable alternative to a balanced and comprehensive approach. That is the view of a large majority of this Parliament. I also welcome the fact that we do not now have a series of endless urgencies on incidental items but that we have a comprehensive approach. This Parliament needs to take a mature approach and this is what Mr Bernard‐Reymond has done. As Mr Gahrton has indicated, the Delegation for China tabled Amendment No 11 which points out that it is very important that certain of the negative developments at the present time should be tackled. I would like to hear how Sir Leon Brittan sees this turnaround on democracy and human rights. It is an important and a negative development.</p>
<p class="contents">As other speakers have said, there are also positive developments. We should at the present time see that in economic terms China is in the midst of a hurricane. If that hurricane swamps it we will also feel the effects. There has been economic and political courage on the part of the Chinese which is worth noting. On Hong Kong, as others have said, things are better than we expected. That is why I should like to emphasise that between the extremism of Mr Ephremidis and – my apologies, Mr Dupuis – the non‐alternative of the ARE, which has tabled 26 amendments but really has no alternative policies, Mr Bernard‐Reymond's policy is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to apply pressure to China on human rights, not only for moral self‐satisfaction but because it is in the best interests of China itself. That society can only develop if it takes into account pluriformity, human rights and political opposition. That is the road ahead as the example of Russia has indicated. The size of China is such that there are not many models that can be applied to that country. For that reason we hope that Mr Bernard‐Reymond's approach will be shared by a large majority of this Parliament.</p>

It is easy to get angry with Sierra Leone or Guinea‐ Bissau, but much more difficult to tell the truth about what is happening in China today. Every kind of opposition is fiercely repressed, all freedom of expression and opinion is denied, the only representatives of a possible opposition to the communist regime, which tortures and butchers those who oppose it, are convicted after farcical trials. And we continue to have this accommodating attitude. We see it in this report too. Despite Mr Bernard‐Reymond's excellent intentions, it seems that, here again, Europe is demonstrating that it is completely subservient to the <span class="italic">de facto</span> logic of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in the last few weeks cannot be passed over in silence. I strongly believe that if Europe is worth anything, if it still has a purpose, it must speak out in defence of human rights, especially when dealing with the strongest countries which obviously set an example, as is currently the case with China on the Asian front, and not only there. In the light of all this, how can we still consider granting aid and subsidies and maintaining relations with people who torture and butcher their political opponents? In the light of all this, I ask you all whether there should not be a radical change in the attitude of the European Parliament and the Commission towards this bloody and oppressive regime.</p>

This strategy is aimed at helping China to become an increasingly prominent player on the international stage. In this respect, bearing in mind its own interests and the need to define an independent policy from that of the United States of America, I believe that the European Union should support China"s accession to the World Trade Organisation given the obligations inherent in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that progress has been made in the area of human rights. However, I feel that the <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> of the economic and commercial interests of the European Union, or rather of certain Member States, should not make us think that China is already applying the rule of law because it is not! But we should support the progress being made in this direction. However, I believe that we should give our Chinese partners a stern warning with regard to the recent worsening of certain problems involving human rights, the persecution of political opponents and ethnic and national minorities and, in particular, the situation of workers laid off without any union rights, trade‐union freedoms or respect for the right to strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the specific matter of Macao, in my opinion the rapporteur has handled this well because he has understood the specific situation of this territory arising from its history and its particular characteristics. Macao can act as a gateway for China to the West and to the European Union and as a bridge between Europe, in all its diversity, and China.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that the European Union should monitor the transfer of Macao to Chinese rule at the end of this year as closely as it did with Hong Kong, in order to support the application of the ‘one country, two systems" principle. There are many problems still to be resolved relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms, nationality, the guarantee that China will respect the ban in force on the death penalty, religious freedom, freedom of association, the regulation of the two official languages of the territory – Chinese and Portuguese – and the need to establish an independent judiciary as quickly as possible, specifically with a local court of last instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union can help the civil society in Macao to develop. I would ask the Commission to prepare a communication, as happened with Hong Kong, on future relations between the European Union and Macao and, at the same time, to produce regular reports on the situation. In order to ensure that everything works correctly, a Commission delegation is needed for Macao. I must point out that the current delegation to Hong Kong has not been able to assume its responsibilities of also representing the European Union in Macao. I would ask the Commissioner to explain the unacceptable attitude demonstrated by the European Union delegate to Hong Kong, who seems to be ignoring the fact that he is also responsible for representing the EU in Macao.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Porto </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the building of a comprehensive partnership with China is to be welcomed in all respects as this is in our interest, it is in the interest of China and it is also undoubtedly in the interest of world peace and prosperity. This has been duly emphasised in the Commission communication and in Mr Bernard‐Raymond"s report, both of which should therefore be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this therefore lends particular importance to paragraph A−5 of the communication and to paragraph 41 of the motion for a resolution, which expresses the hope that the transfer of Macao to Chinese rule will be done correctly. This transfer must happen in a way which benefits the Macao population and also China, which has much to gain from the existence in Macao of a democratic and prosperous society and of another gateway to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the role which Macao can play is also of primary interest to the European Union. This role must be totally independent of Hong Kong"s role, as has just been mentioned. The alternative to links with us is surely not links through Hong Kong, which the people of Macao are entitled to reject in view of the fear that this would put them in a subordinate position with a real risk that they would become lost, without their own voice, in the massive territory of China.</p>
<p class="contents">Macao has its own identity and lies in an area which is very different from China, giving us twice as many opportunities to become closer. This identity and these opportunities have to date justified the participation of Macao in the World Trade Organisation and the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Macao – unlike with Hong Kong – which must be maintained after the transfer to Chinese rule. This therefore represents a clear opportunity which the European Union would be foolish to waste. An obvious step towards maintaining and increasing our presence would be the immediate introduction of our own representation in Macao. This would not cost much as the Macao authorities would certainly be keen to share the costs with us. I would ask the Commissioner whether he intends to take any steps in this direction?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span> . – Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to Mr Bernard‐Reymond's balanced and well‐reasoned report. I am glad to see that for many parts of the House, in particular Mr Swoboda, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Porto, there is considerable support for its balanced approach. The European Union has a profound interest in helping the emergence of a stable, prosperous and open China that embraces political pluralism, free markets, the rule of law and assists in building a secure international order. To those such as Mr Dupuis' wing who believe that we have not been strong enough on the human rights situation, or Mr Ephremidis who approaches things in a rather different way, I have to say that I do not believe that they have put forward a real alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of our approach is that it is a long‐term one. It has to be pursued in good times and in bad, unless there is a fundamental change in the situation. There is no doubt that both economically and politically the situation in China today is less hopeful than it was even a year ago. I do not believe that is a reason for fundamentally changing the approach we have followed or the one that is commended by Mr Bernard‐Reymond both in his speech and in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the report is timely. Under Prime Minister Zhu Rongji China has launched a series of key economic reforms. Against the backdrop of the Asian crisis, however, these reforms are likely to come under pressure this coming year as economic growth slows. Recent events in China have also given rise to serious concerns related to respect for human rights. In these circumstances it is important – indeed essential – for us to convey the right signals to China. Our communication set out a number of fundamental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we want to engage China further through an upgraded political dialogue into the international community. Over the past decade China has taken welcome steps on arms control, non‐proliferation regimes, on preserving the global environment, combatting international crime and drug trafficking. We should build upon China's desire to be recognised as a global responsible actor on the world stage and develop dialogue on global issues of common concern. The history of the past shows that can yield practical results and is not just an idle dream.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to integrate China further in the world economy by bringing it more fully into the world trading system and by supporting the process of economic and social reform that is under way. China is the fastest growing market for European goods and services. It is clearly in our interest to bring it more fully into the global economy. Access to that market is too restrictive. We do not want to retaliate though by creating a self‐defeating cycle of protectionism. On the contrary, the openness of the European market will constitute our best contribution to helping China face the current crisis in Asia but we remain committed to opening markets further, including China's. To the proposition that China should join the WTO, the answer is Yes, but on commercially meaningful terms, agreeing to the opening up of its economy. That is appropriate for a country of its size and state of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I make no apologies for referring to the question of size. It is the case that in a country the size of China – and it is not going to disappear and it is not going to change because we say nastier things or pass nastier resolutions – it is only by engaging honestly, economically and politically, being frank and candid, that we stand a chance of bringing about change in that country. The European Union is dedicated to supporting China's transition to an open society based upon the rule of law and full respect for human rights. Of course we are not satisfied with the current situation in China. We have chosen a pragmatic and results‐oriented approach on this issue in which we challenge the Chinese authorities on issues and events of concern to us such as the recent spate of dissident trials and arrests. We are not silent on those issues but, at the same time, we expand our areas of cooperation. Both poles of the policy are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue on human rights has been useful but we have made it very clear to the Chinese authorities that we now need to achieve specific and tangible progress to maintain the credibility of this dialogue. Recent developments in China that have been referred to have underlined that need. We have asked for the release of dissidents imprisoned after the recent crackdown and that issue will remain on our agenda until these dissidents are released.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, we have made clear to the Chinese authorities that we will identify benchmarks by which progress in the dialogue will be judged. This innovation will ensure that the necessary pressure and momentum in the dialogue is maintained. The question arises: What kind of benchmarks? The kind we will be looking at include the following demands: Firstly, we need more detailed information on political prisoners, their number, the charges on which they have been sentenced, their health conditions, as well as access to some prisoners for European and NGO representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to see specific steps taken to improve prison conditions and reform the penal system, including conditions of appeal and access to judicial review in line with international standards. The latter point is particularly relevant with regard to the death penalty and the situation of dissidents convicted for so‐called counter‐revolutionary crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to see benchmarks for progress towards the ratification of the United Nations Human Rights Covenants which includes the follow‐up to Mary Robinson's visit and closer cooperation with the European Union within the human rights dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, another category of benchmarks relates to ethnic minorities especially those in Tibet. It covers a wide range of issues such as the transparency of demographic information, the free use of the Tibetan language as well as open and clear information on alleged incidents involving ethnic minority groups and dissidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these recent differences on human rights, I hope you will agree that European policy towards China, as exemplified by the Commission communication and Mr Bernard‐Reymond's report, has progressed significantly in a positive direction in recent years. I am heartened to see that our communication and your report are broadly in agreement with each other. That applies to Hong Kong as well. I am sorry that I am not able to promise an early opening of a delegation in Macao. We are having great difficulty in getting the resources and support we need for the delegations we want to open. We will certainly examine the specific suggestions made in the report and incorporate them as fully as possible into the substance of our relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge of developing a comprehensive and robust relationship between China and the European Union is one of the great geo‐strategic challenges for the next century. It is my belief that we have laid solid foundations to allow the European Union of the future to meet such a crucial challenge and that we should be steady in our approach, firm in what we have to say but balanced in our policy.</p>
