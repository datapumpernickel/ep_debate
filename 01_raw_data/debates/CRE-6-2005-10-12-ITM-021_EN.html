<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Anna Záborská (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, in the words of Father Joseph Wresinski: ‘Wherever men are condemned to live in extreme poverty, the rights of Man are violated: it is our sacred duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected’. This leitmotif of the World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty is also enshrined in the very philosophy of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty must be eradicated in the new Europe, going beyond strategies enabling it to become the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world. It must be eradicated in order to promote the dignity and responsibility of all of the citizens. Is not the well-being of a society also measured in terms of the way it treats its weakest members? It is true that work integrates an individual into a group, but that is not enough to make somebody a citizen, and experience has shown this. Yes, the partnership with the least-favoured citizens is needed because they are the experts in combating extreme poverty. Poor people who have not been inducted into citizenship will not be incorporated into the life of society either. Could they too not be recognised as true builders of the new Europe? In order for the poorest people to become active partners, however, they first of all need a voice, they need recognition, security and integration. Combating extreme poverty means respecting the rights of everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand of the Fourth World committee, the oldest intergroup in the European Parliament, comes at just the right time to strengthen the social inclusion strategy, to create real conditions in which people living in poverty can participate and, finally, to assess the true impact of our European policies on the lives of the poorest families in the Member States, which is absolutely crucial. The fact that a person is living in poverty does not mean that others must decide what is best for them on their behalf. For example, why take children away from their families for socio-economic reasons relating to extreme poverty? Would it not be better instead to support their parents, who also have the right to carry out their duties as parents. They feel the same joys, the same aspirations, the same fears and the same doubts, but in much more difficult circumstances. And while poverty affects women more, it is they who have the greatest desire to defend their loved ones from poverty and social exclusion. Women, who build fundamental links and create peace, must be encouraged to promote human rights and dignity for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by stressing that seventy-three amendments have been debated in committee. With the exception of two or three of them, they have been accepted. The report was then voted for unanimously, and I would like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation. There is one point to make, though, since my colleagues from the Communist Group propose, by means of Amendment 7, removing access to primary health care by poor women. It is true that access to public health is an essential element in the quest for a decent common life for everybody. But that is not enough. Why not support women in their fight against poverty by allowing them to remain in good health? What are we talking about? We are talking about enabling them to eat healthily, to access clean drinking water, to plan their families and to have access to vaccines and basic treatments for common illnesses. And why refuse them the right to gynaeco-obstetrical health? As a doctor, I do not understand that. In fact, I find it insulting. I would ask all of you to promote primary health care, including for the poorest women, and to reject Amendment 7. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, if I may I should like to start by thanking the Members of the House, and in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, for having drafted this report. The poverty and social exclusion affecting women are enormously important issues. The feminisation of poverty is an ongoing trend in European societies, and indeed your report highlights this fact. The majority of those suffering unemployment or long-term unemployment are women, and women are far more likely than men to work part-time. There is no getting away from the fact that women are still subjected to violence, both in public and in private. Furthermore, around 500 000 women in Europe each year are trafficked for sexual exploitation. Both of these problems are frequently a consequence of the poverty in which these women are forced to live.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report reaffirms that the employment of women is still the key to their economic independence, and one of the main means of overcoming the poverty trap and social exclusion. Employment has a direct impact on the standing of women in society as a whole. EU measures in the field of employment are a key tool for achieving equality between women and men, and it is important to adopt an integrated approach in order to increase employment levels and to make it easier for women to join the workforce. This approach must be tailored to women’s needs, and protect the interests of certain groups of women that are most at risk of social exclusion, such as single mothers, migrant women, women from ethnic minorities, women suffering ill health and older women.</p>
<p class="contents">The proportion of women in employment increased from 50.6% to 55.7% between 1997 and 2004. One of the main reasons for this was the economic growth experienced by Europe during this period, even though this growth was relatively slow. Employment is therefore on the rise, although marked inequalities and numerous instances of gender discrimination still persist in this field. As a general rule, women are more likely to be unemployed, and the jobs they do have are frequently worse paid, less permanent and less advantageous in terms of social security. At the same time, women continue to be largely responsible for the care of children and other dependents. The goals set using the open method of coordination for the fight against social exclusion highlight how important it is for the Member States to consider gender equality when developing, implementing and monitoring the national action plans in the field of social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The national action plans are key components of the European method, and are reviewed every two years. In theory, all Member States are obliged to consider gender equality in all fields, or in other words to apply gender mainstreaming to all national implementing measures. In order to make this task simpler, joint indicators of poverty and exclusion are collected on a regular basis, both for men and for women. In addition, funding under the Social Exclusion Action Programme makes social inclusion more visible and promotes the involvement of stakeholders on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to stress three priorities for the future. Firstly, equality between women and men must become a priority goal for social security systems, with the aim of boosting the social rights of minority workers. Secondly, we must promote policies aimed at increasing the availability of high-quality care for children and other dependents of any age, so that men and women do in fact have a choice when it comes to work-life balance. Finally, the gender equality dimension must be strengthened in policies and measures aimed at combating poverty and social exclusion, in order to prevent the feminisation of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to an issue that is proof of how important a role each one of us has to play, and of how legislation alone sometimes achieves very little. EU legislation aimed at preventing a gender pay gap has been in place for 30 years, but the difference in pay between men and women currently stands at 16-33%, depending on the Member State. As I see it, it is quite clear that what is now needed is an integrated and consistent approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number is only seventeen because some countries did not submit their data.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics have long shown that two groups face an exceptional risk: first – single parents, 85% of whom are women, which shows that the risk of poverty is clearly gender-specific; secondly – women in the labour market, who are in a disadvantageous position mainly due to motherhood and differences in remuneration associated with it, which are also reflected in the size of their pensions. Two-thirds of people of retirement age are women over 65 and yet, according to the European Economic and Social Committee, their average income is only 53% of the income of men of retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen declared that it is necessary to devote attention to the needs and rights of women and children, who often bear the heaviest burden of poverty. Poverty among women is often connected with the poverty of children, and results in the perpetuation of a poorly educated labour force of low employability. One result of this is the creation of an intergenerational poverty trap and an important barrier to the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives, bearing in mind such figures as the percentage of school dropouts, which is as high as 18% among boys.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, poverty clearly has a serious gender dimension. I also want to emphasise this in connection with the fact that some of our colleagues believe that it is possible and necessary to abolish the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of poverty, the world loses 900 000 children a month. According to the 2005 UN report, the number of children dying every month due to poverty is equivalent to three times the number of victims of the tsunami that hit South East Asia in December 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, thousands and thousands of people, mainly women and children, die due to poverty. The target set as part of the Millennium Development Goals 2000, aimed at reducing child mortality, will be missed by 4.4 million. By contrast, if one adds together the incomes of the 500 wealthiest people in the world, the figure comes to more than the income of the 416 million poorest people. The 2.5 billion people living on less than USD 2 per day account for 40% of the world’s population, but only 5% of the world’s income. The Millennium Declaration included a promise to reduce poverty by half within 15 years. Yet the gap between rich and poor continues to widen.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much that can be done to rescue the large numbers of women and children from poverty. Let me cite just one example. Microfinancing instruments, such as microcredit, have proved effective in combating poverty, and it is women who have derived most benefit from microcredit and have managed to improve their families’ economic situation. These women are unemployed, or on low incomes, and do not have access to conventional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, too, 16% of the population faced the risk of poverty in 2003, according to Eurostat figures. There are around 70 million poor citizens in the Europe of 25. This is why the Socialist Group in Parliament has tabled an amendment to this report, with the intention of setting up, by legislative means, a guaranteed minimum income – along the lines of what already exists in my country, Portugal – as a way of effectively combating poverty, and in particular poverty among women.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty leads to the trafficking of women and children, to sexual slavery, to violence, to children giving up school, to child labour, to children being placed at risk, to fundamentalism and even to terrorism. Preventing poverty means building a fairer and safer society for all, including the wealthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, as has been said, poverty has a female face in Europe as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of the Member States, social security systems do not take sufficient account of the specific conditions of women. For this reason, this Parliament must make a clear appeal to the Member States to establish and guarantee a basic income as a fundamental instrument in the fight against poverty — which, I would insist, affects women mostly — within the context of an overall policy of promoting social and economic integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore — and we have presented this in an amendment — I would like to insist once again on the need to replace the expression ‘domestic violence’ with ‘gender violence’, since it is a form of violence which should not be characterised by the place in which it takes place, but rather by the way our society distributes roles amongst men and women, which often leads many men to believe that they are superior and that women are their possessions, which regrettably leads to violence.</p>

<p class="contents">Poverty obviously affects people’s whole life situation and has bearing upon education, health, housing and social exclusion, but I particularly wish to emphasise the significance of women’s ability to provide for themselves. Work is the most important route of escape from poverty, and it is therefore particularly worrying that the 1975 directive on equal pay for male and female employees has still not been implemented. Women’s salaries in the EU are on average still only 85% of men’s. In certain countries, the difference is even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above these unjustified salary differences, women are directed to low-paid jobs, part-time work, poorer conditions of employment etc. Moreover, this discrimination follows women throughout their lives, right up to retirement age with pensions systems that also discriminate against women.

Poverty cannot, however, be separated from the liberal view of the world that led to an economic policy model focused on profit and individual careers to the detriment of the good of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">Avaricious capitalism is one of the main causes of poverty, as it results in the rich becoming richer whilst the poor are reduced to indigence. There is also inhuman globalisation and the so-called free market controlled by monopolies, together with feminist tendencies that do untold harm to families. The latter fall apart, and human relationships are lost. The move from the so-called patriarchal model of marriage to a union of partners places an additional burden on women who are more likely to decide to divorce if they find themselves in difficult situations. It is also the cause of increased poverty, especially amongst women over the age of 65.</p>
<p class="contents">Reiterating the claim that poverty is caused by workers’ low productivity consequent upon their poor state of health, malnutrition and lack of qualifications is a curious travesty of the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the House to the causes of poverty in Poland. Despite its enormous potential, my country is the poorest Member State of the European Union, according to Eurostat. It also has the highest level of unemployment, and this is due both to the corruption of the governing post Communist-liberal coalition and to the consequences of adjusting the economy to meet the conditions for accession. The poverty endured by most of Polish society, including women, will not be helped by propaganda, empty slogans, reports, directives or by a World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty, which will cost a fortune. What is needed is an economic order based on solidarity whose purpose is to promote the interests of human beings, that is of ordinary men and women. Such an order must comply with moral standards, as the latter lay down the proper way to treat our neighbours, especially the individuals, countries or regions that are weaker than us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me first thank the rapporteur for a concise and substantive report, which may serve as a good starting point for the elimination of poverty and thus for fulfilling a fundamental objective of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of poverty is closely linked to its feminisation. Women are the most vulnerable to poverty, especially as breadwinners of households. On the one hand, globalisation and the advent of computer technologies have increased economic opportunities and independence for some women. On the other hand, many women are being pushed towards the periphery of society and denied the benefits of this process due to low educational levels, social prejudice or greater age.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the Member States must prepare measures to ensure that women living in poverty are provided with equal access to public health systems – mainly primary healthcare, including the protection of mothers with children, as well as gynaecological care – education and work experience. This is the main remedy for a diagnosis of poverty. The time has come when we cannot remain passive in a world where women and children die of hunger, remain illiterate and are unable to build a decent life for their closest family members. We must protect life at each and every moment, and make the world a better place for all, without prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission, along with all of us, to adopt a responsible attitude to the misery afflicting millions of poor people, be it the poor of the developing world or of our cities, and thus to create opportunities for a decent life, in the spirit of solidarity and European values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is even worse in countries outside the EU of 25. It follows that every possible EU instrument – whether the European Neighbourhood or Foreign Policies, development or finance policy – should be used to the utmost if we are to be able to alleviate poverty at home and abroad. National plans of action must include specific measures to alleviate poverty and the Commission must monitor the way in which they are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of the utmost importance that more attention be paid to women both in the European Employment Guidelines and in the Lisbon Strategy. The European Union’s development policy must do more to address poverty reduction, while, at the same time, international development policy must, as a matter of urgency, be analysed to ascertain to what extent groups at risk are either being helped or further marginalised. The World Bank, the G-8, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organisation must show their hands and set out the specific effects that their policies have had on women and poverty in the past and what the effect of them is now.</p>
<p class="contents">One possible result of poverty outside the EU’s 25 Member States is an increase in illegal immigration, people-smuggling, and criminal activity, with an eventual increase in the trafficking of women. We will therefore reiterate our long-standing demand that the Member States should, once and for all, legislate for a guaranteed minimum income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand there is high unemployment, and on the other the economic pressure to have two wage packets coming into each household. We ought to be making an effort to transfer at least part of that unemployment to homes and families, as we will have to finance it anyway. A woman running a household does not feel unemployed. Quite the opposite is the case, as she is busy 24 hours a day. The state of her hands is proof enough of that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing a very great disservice to women in charge of a household if we deem them to be unemployed. By contrast, an unemployed man feels frustrated, useless, worthless and defeated.</p>
<p class="contents">The commonest reason for poverty in a family is the father losing his job. Families living off a single wage tend to have a very modest lifestyle, but they do not feel poor. Their strong family life is their fortune. Fewer behavioural problems arise in families of this kind. A country that helps families living off a single wage, by providing tax relief or benefits for example, will need to spend less on nurseries, young offenders’ centres, prisons, old people’s homes and similar institutions. That country will also rejoice in more happy women, happy children and happy husbands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that a number of fundamental conclusions can be drawn from it. To a certain extent, of course, these conclusions are set out in the original report, but they have been reiterated today with renewed urgency, and sometimes backed up with fresh arguments. There is no denying that women are more at risk of poverty, and that this means that there can be no talk of equal opportunities in a society that quite clearly provides one sex with fewer opportunities. In spite of all our achievements in the field of equal opportunities policies, and the progress we have made, we therefore still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that has emerged quite clearly is that poverty is a particular threat to women in certain social situations, although this threat is of course ever-present for women during their entire life. Demographic ageing means that we are faced with the problem of poor widows, and, in particular, poor single women, and this is one of the issues that must be taken into account. In my opinion, the debate also made it clear that we cannot rely on progress as a given, or in other words on the simple notion that progress will be achieved one day, and that the situation will gradually get better each year until we achieve the desired outcome. Progress of this kind requires very considerable effort at all levels, in particular at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">Comments were also made during the debate regarding the importance of a minimum income, and I should merely like to note that we intend to present a communication on this issue by the end of the year. I believe that this could mark the beginning of a fundamental and in-depth debate on the concept of a minimum income, and on the way in which individual Member States deal with this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you again for the report that has been tabled. I have studied it quite thoroughly, and there would appear to be only one aspect of it that I do not entirely understand. I believe that I understand the basic principles involved, since they have already been suggested during certain debates in this Chamber, namely that a great deal of work carried out is informal, and disregarded in terms of the official economy and gross domestic product, even though this work is no less real. This is how I understand the part of the report that talks about the economics of life, and I merely wanted to make sure that this was in fact what was meant, since it would obviously be interesting to hold a structured debate on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen, for the report that has been tabled. Its conclusions are unquestionably inspiring, and will play a role in the European Union’s progress towards the eradication of poverty and the achievement of equal opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women face multiple discrimination – elder women, women belonging to ethnic minorities, disabled women, lone parents – and are potential victims of social exclusion and extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of poverty is linked to unemployment. This risk increases if unemployment remains high. Integrating disabled people, long-term unemployed, elder people and ethnic minorities into employment is a key challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic, employment and social policies are mutually reinforcing. Economic development should be accompanied by efforts to reduce poverty and to fight exclusion and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Helping women getting employed is one of the key elements since employment generates income and promote social participation. If the Lisbon employment target set for 2010 is to be achieved, factors underlying gender gap in employment, and pay need to be tackled vigorously. Actions which make it easier for women to reconcile career with family should be further pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">Exchange of best practices of Member States would be of great use in social protection systems, in eliminating and preventing violence against women.</p>

The report demonstrates that the non-centralised discussions of European politics provide an opportunity to analyse our common problems relating to the further enlargement of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty of women can be explained by social and societal dynamics that affect other sections of society, too. Examples include those living in disadvantaged regions, people with a disability, ethnic groups or older people living in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The female face of poverty is very marked in these vulnerable sections of society. Women tend to have lower wages, short(er) tenure of employment, and, in the old Member States, a lower standard of living. The cultural traditions of immigrants and ‘indigenous’ Roma people create particular community-related obstacles in the way of creating long-term financial security and autonomy for women.</p>
<p class="contents">The groups of women most at risk of falling into poverty are lone parents and (single) older women. In the central European region women face an exceptionally high risk of poverty, with poverty rates between 21% and 28%.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in life expectancy means that in future larger numbers of elderly people will face poverty unless European solidarity comes to their aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Asserting human rights also helps to alleviate poverty. The right to human dignity is a fundamental human right. Poverty denies people the possibility of choosing how they live their lives. Our mission is to restore freedom of self-determination to women, who comprise the majority of the world’s population. Let us call ourselves and the EU institutions to account on this issue whenever we legislate or share out Community funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Deep poverty does exist in Europe. Therefore this Parliament fully agrees that Europe -along with an adequate assistance strategy- should join UN efforts and contribute to ease the difficulties of those in need.</p>
<p class="contents">With the forthcoming accessions, Roma minority population of Central and Eastern Europe will grow from a present estimated 1,5-2 million to 5-6 million, forming largest ethnic minority group in the EU. Substantial fraction of Roma live amongst particularly marginalised conditions, often in large families with many children. (Ms Zaborska is right in calling attention to double discrimination by gender and origin, however misses to note the threat of consequent child poverty). Multiple handicaps lead to defying conditions for improvement or break through in need of prevention or targeted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission to make sure that complex development projects aimed at improving the quality of life of disadvantaged communities -especially that of the Roma minority- will be embedded in the new cohesion policy of 2007-13 as requested by the EP-Roma Forum on 31st January, suggesting to join forces and share tasks with the 'Roma Decade Programme' launched on 2nd February by the World Bank, the Open Society Foundation and 8 European national governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
