<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kristalina Georgieva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to thank you for putting Pakistan on the agenda. More importantly, I would also like to thank Parliament for its active contribution so far to the EU response by organising very useful meetings at committee level and for having exercised your right of scrutiny very rapidly, in fact in one day, this summer. That allowed us to adopt financing decisions swiftly to ensure help could be on its way.</p>
<p class="contents">My aim today is to convey the impressions gained from my recent mission to Pakistan, identify the next steps in our efforts, and conclude with some lessons we can draw for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me start with my impressions of Pakistan, which were dominated by the fact that this is an incredibly complex situation which is actually two disasters in one.</p>
<p class="contents">Up in the North, there are 3 million internally displaced people and refugees, who have had to flee from armed conflicts only to see their camps and their newly-built houses washed away and their newly-built lives destroyed. Downstream, in the fertile plains of South Pakistan, rural communities have lost not only their homes, but also their livelihoods and a large part of the economy of Pakistan on which the country relies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I briefed the Development Committee, the numbers indicating the impact of this disaster have actually gone up. All in all, more than 20 million Pakistanis have been affected by the floods across the whole country. More than 12 million people are in need of immediate assistance.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President asked some Members to be quiet)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I know that the issue that was discussed before is a very important one for European values. As indeed is the one I am addressing now, so thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of numbers, just a week ago, we were talking about 8 million people being in need of immediate assistance. Now the numbers have been revised upwards to 12 million. More than 1.8 million houses have been destroyed or damaged; this number has been revised up from 1.2 million. More than 3.4 million hectares of agricultural land are under water. There are reports of diarrhoea and cholera outbreaks. In these conditions, our aid is focusing on the obvious immediate priorities: food, clean water, sanitation, health assistance and shelter. In the face of a disaster of such massive proportions, massive international relief assistance is necessary. So let me move straight to the next point. What has the EU done, and what do we intend to do next?</p>
<p class="contents">Our humanitarian response has been significant. The EU, that is, the Member States and the Commission, has contributed so far a total of EUR 231 million for immediate relief assistance, with EUR 70 million coming from the Commission and the remaining EUR 161 million from the Member States. Twelve Member States have also mobilised in-kind assistance through the Union’s civil protection mechanism. This makes us the largest donor. Our contribution should be measured against the UN call for USD 460 million for immediately relief, but I must also stress that this call is going to be revised upwards and we will probably get a new appeal from the UN within a week.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assistance was also swift. On 30 July, it became clear that the floods were going to be devastating and our first financial decision for EUR 30 million was taken on the next day, 31 July.</p>
<p class="contents">We activated the European Civil Protection Mechanism, on receiving a request from the Pakistani authorities, immediately on 6 August, and we deployed a team of 18 experts to coordinate our assistance with the UN and the Pakistani authorities so it could be most effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fist time that in-kind aid from Member States has been delivered using civil strategic airlift capacity in coordination with the EU military staff. It allowed us to provide much-needed water purification units, mobile hospitals, medicine, shelter and tents. But I am not going to hide the fact that, despite this tremendous effort, there are big challenges ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me highlight four main challenges. First, the humanitarian crisis is far from over. We may not yet have even reached the peak of this crisis. We know from relief workers that, as of today, they expect in the month of September to have reached 6 million people out of the 12 million who are in need of assistance. So, in a way, the crisis is expanding faster than help can be mobilised to catch up with it. The situation may get worse before it gets better, especially in terms of epidemics.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is critically important, as we strive to reach as many people as possible, to target those that are most vulnerable. These include poor communities, women, especially women-led households, children, the elderly and the handicapped, because they are likely to be left out if they are not targeted consciously. So this is exactly what the Commission aims to do, working with our 26 partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, bringing aid speedily is not only a matter of people’s survival. It is also a matter of preserving the stability of a country which faces significant security challenges. Popular discontent can easily grow out of desperation and therefore, we have to be absolutely determined to try to help people as quickly as possible, as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, important as it is to save lives today, we also need to think of recovery starting now. In terms of early recovery, there are two very important tasks. To ensure agricultural recovery when the water recedes, we have to be ready with tools and seeds and with help to farmers so they can catch up this planting season. At the same time, there is a need to rebuild the critical infrastructure that connects farmers to markets and also allows us to reach out to remote communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, obviously, the country is facing a major challenge of recovery. An assessment led by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, with the Commission and the UNDP, is currently ongoing to determine the long-term recovery needs. We have been working throughout very closely with High Representative and Vice-President Ashton, Commissioner Piebalgs and Commissioner De Gucht so that the European Union can come up with a comprehensive and holistic proposal as to how we can support the country’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan will be on the agenda in the next Gymnich meeting and at the Friends of Democratic Pakistan meeting in Brussels on 14 and 15 October.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me draw some lessons for the EU. I see three. First, the Pakistani floods are only one of many reminders that the impact of climate change is profound. Looking at the resulting cost, it is very important to focus on disaster preparedness and also on rebuilding a highly vulnerable country devastated by a disaster in a way that is resilient to the risk of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking a cautious approach, I cannot claim that these floods are caused by climate change. I certainly know, however, that scientific opinion is very clear that the increased frequency and intensity of disasters is due to climate change. Secondly, in a year which saw an earthquake in Haiti, a drought in the Sahel, conflict in Sudan and now floods of major proportions in Pakistan, once again, our budgetary situation is precarious, as our own budget and the emergency aid reserve are almost depleted. Yet it is still only the beginning of September.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the upward trend in the number and intensity of disasters, there is a widening gap in our humanitarian budget which must be taken into account as we prepare for the next Financial Perspective so we can match our resources to our citizens’ commitment to helping people in need.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that the EU has been on the front line since the outset of the crisis and yet, in the early days, our presence was not widely reported in the media. We have to focus very strongly, therefore, on improving not only the efficiency but also the visibility of EU disaster response instruments, as was indicated this morning in the session that you had with President Barroso. We will come up with a proposal in the next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by stating with pride, on behalf of our citizens, that Pakistan has shown that EU solidarity is not just words; it is deeds and action. We can take pride in that, because our work is not only saving lives but also upholding principles and values that are at the heart of the European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Georgieva for the rapid and appropriate action of the Commission. It is a pity that we did not manage to organise an extraordinary sitting of our Parliament’s Committee on Development during the summer recess. We have to remember that millions of people still need help, support and cooperation. Your priorities, Mrs Georgieva, apart from immediate aid, agriculture and transport, are, indeed, crucial. If it does not prove possible to salvage Pakistan’s agriculture, then next year, the country will suffer another humanitarian disaster – a famine. Paradoxically, there is a chance that the floods will have certain beneficial effects. For example, they might hinder the activities of extremists or make it easier to solve the refugee problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that you plan to present an initiative to increase the effectiveness of our instruments for reacting to humanitarian disasters. I am pleased, too, that the Belgian Presidency is ready to adopt the initiative as a priority for its own Presidency. The European Parliament will certainly support such initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have certainly been equal to your task.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, there is so much still to be done, and there has been a sort of divorce between Pakistan and public opinion. The picture is confused, people do not want to donate, and this is a real problem. Attendance is very sparse today, and people sometimes say to me: ‘Oh, you know, there is no issue in Pakistan now; the water is receding.’ Well, yes, the water is receding, but we are still faced with a disaster of the highest order, just as serious as the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points that I am conscious of. The first is an improvement in our rapid response mechanism. You have done as much as you could, in terms of coordination and so on, and with the funds at your disposal. This is not at all a criticism. Nevertheless, I think that Europe has every interest in strengthening its rapid response mechanism, along similar lines to the Belgian B-Fast, and I call on the Belgian Presidency to work on this issue together with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the problem of women. As I have already told you, Commissioner, women are frequently forgotten in conflicts and disasters. We know what the fate of Pakistani women is. We know that today, at this very moment, there are 300 000 women who will be going into labour in the coming weeks. We know that 30 000 of them will need surgical intervention, and I beg you to take targeted action on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There are local NGOs with access almost everywhere on the ground – those linked with the International Planned Parenthood Federation, for example. Look for local agreements and keep us informed. What we ask of you, Commissioner, is not accounts, but news of those women. I hope that you will be able to give us that news. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, in view of the suffering and the misery caused by these floods, which are of a rare severity, I feel it is already appropriate to talk of an ocean of problems, sorrow, suffering and despair.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our collective responsibility to act. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">First, because the 20 million direct victims of this disaster cannot recover from it unaided. Next, our responsibility is a European Union responsibility, but it is also the responsibility of the Member States, which amounts to the same thing. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the moment has come to put an end to this artificial distinction, the reason for which no longer exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is indeed assuming its responsibilities, and you, Commissioner, are an example of this. Europe is even doing this in an exemplary fashion. Is it not the European Union that, generally speaking, turns out to be the first provider of funds for humanitarian action? Others would be greatly inspired to increase their contribution to aiding Pakistan to emerge from the misery caused by the current floods. I am thinking in particular of the wealthy states and of the oil-rich powers in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this mean that we Europeans are perfect? No. I believe we could do even better without having to spend more. First, there is the Barnier report, which calls for the resources and instruments that the 27 could apply in a disaster to be pooled. What are we waiting for in order finally to implement the conclusions of this report?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the lack of visibility of the European Union. It is certainly not the most important aspect, but it must be put right, but not in a fit of boasting or a show of generosity. What matters, in this case, is that the European Union does everything it can to stand out in what it knows how to do best, which is to clearly assert itself as the world’s leading humanitarian actor and to excel in what is beginning to be seen as its true vocation – namely, to become a truly powerful agent of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I very much welcome the Commissioner’s response, and indeed her longer-term perspective, not least the link to climate resilience. I share the concerns she has voiced about long-term funding for such disasters. I think we would all urge the international community to intensify its response. We would certainly like to welcome India’s increased contribution to the UN fund, because that sends an important political signal.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the international community could go further. It could release more of Pakistan’s own money by taking action to relieve Pakistan’s international debt, much of which was incurred under military regimes. In 2008, Pakistan spent USD 3 billion on debt repayment: this dwarfs the international aid effort. France and Germany are important bilateral donors. I think we should look with some concern at the repayment terms that may be on offer for the loans that are currently being put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that I think it is important to have a similar response from within Pakistan, not least from rich landowners who could, for example, offer some sort of rent relief for poor tenant farmers who are not going to be able to pay their rent for some time to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our response – led by the Commissioner – has indeed been commendable, both at an EU level and from the Member States acting on a bilateral basis. The UK certainly did all that it could.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very saddening to note that, whilst the people of Pakistan were facing this catastrophe, their President was enjoying the best and finest that Europe had to offer. Whilst he was doing that, we started to mobilise and stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Pakistan. I am very proud that we did that.</p>
<p class="contents">As the civil infrastructure crumbled, it was the military that had to step in. The fact that we have been working to provide the emergency relief required is very commendable. However, the emergency is still under way as we meet here today. Whilst it is ongoing, we are doing what we can, but we must start to plan our response for the medium to long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The unprecedented scale of the floods warrants an unprecedented international response. We must start to rebuild Pakistan, but we must do this in such a way that the people of Pakistan can be seen to be doing it, or truly unimaginable consequences might unfold. We have a development agenda, but we must also tie into this a trade-related agenda to allow the people of Pakistan to rebuild their country themselves as well.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the major problems is that of access to the victims, as the infrastructure has been destroyed, the victims are surrounded by water, and the security situation is very unstable. It is absolutely essential to respect the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, independence and humanity when dispatching the aid, which must be based solely on the needs of the population.</p>

<p class="contents">It was also perceived that there was a degree of resistance to covering the needs established by the United Nations. Some fellow Members have referred to the resistance that there might be in our societies due to the type of political regime or the problems that there might be in Pakistan. Nevertheless, I think we have to make an effort as Members and in our societies to explain that we are helping people – human beings – who are in difficulties, rather than a particular political regime.

In this regard, what saddens me, in particular, is the fact that there are regions in Pakistan that the central government is not allowing any proper aid to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, for example, the region of Gilgit-Baltistan, north of Jammu and Kashmir within the Pakistani border region, has also been badly hit by heavy rainfall and its effects. According to information I have received, in Gilgit-Baltistan alone, 500 people have died and 50 000 people have been made homeless. Four bridges have been washed away and many areas of land have been completely cut off from the outside world. So far, however, aid equivalent to only around EUR 10 000 has reached Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the European Union should not just hand over its aid to the Pakistani central government but provide direct support to the non-governmental organisations that are also looking after the interests of the remote regions of Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think all of us, here, feel a good deal of satisfaction when we look at the progress made in comparison, for example, with the help given to Haiti. I would like to call attention to two very important matters. The first concerns increasing what the Union really can do – and here I emphasise the words ‘what the Union really can do’ – in giving humanitarian aid. For example, we need to solve questions related to air transport. If such transport is not available, it is difficult to give aid effectively. The second matter is related to improving coordination of operations at EU level. The Union is making a very great effort, but the point is that the efforts made by the Union itself and by the Member States should be coordinated to a greater degree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kristalina Georgieva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like to thank Members for their very useful comments. I shall try to group my response around three sets of issues. Firstly, short-term and long-term priorities, and how we can integrate the advice you have given us here. Secondly, the political environment and how we can protect the neutrality and independence of humanitarian work as well as the safety of humanitarian workers. Thirdly, the EU’s disaster response capacity and what we are currently doing to make sure that it is stronger in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first set of issues, I am very much aligned with the comments that have been made in this House about ensuring that we focus on those at risk of being excluded. This especially concerns the more conservative areas of Pakistan, women, and, of course, children in women-led households, who are at very high risk, and minorities, including religious minorities, to which reference has been made here.</p>
<p class="contents">In any country, including in this case Pakistan, those communities that are simply hard to reach are at particularly high risk. They are cut off either by nature or because of conflicts. I can assure you that we screen proposals from our partners very carefully to make sure that our funding, to a very large degree, targets those at risk of being excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I will follow up with my staff in more detail the specific question that I was asked on the treatment of religious minorities. I do know that we consider minorities very carefully and I am sure we have more specific information on that, as well as on the situation in Kashmir. I can say that we have been working with NGO partners there to be able to reach out to people.</p>
<p class="contents">The point was strongly made here that agriculture is the foundation of a large part of Pakistani society and the Pakistani economy. As the water recedes, it may leave more fertile land, but that will only be an opportunity if we are there fast to help farmers recover their capacity to plant. As always in the case of a disaster, if the response is put together well, especially as regards longer-term rehabilitation, it can also bring improvements in terms of security.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the point that was made about the need to look at raising funds from others. In other words, we should use our moral authority to urge others in the neighbourhood, the Gulf nations, to contribute to Pakistan. They have been doing that and it is true that the EU, having acted quickly and massively, does now have a capacity to call on others. We will continue to do so as we prepare for the Friends of Democratic Pakistan meeting here on 14 and 15 October. The High Representative, Vice-President Catherine Ashton, together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, Minister Qureshi, are going to co-chair this meeting, and we have already agreed to have a special expanded session to try to raise attention, support the efforts of others and urge others to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our Member States and our own resources are concerned, I can say the following. As regards the Commission’s resources, EUR 70 million has already been committed and a large part of it has already been disbursed. The week I was in Pakistan, we ran out of money for the urgent relief projects that we are supporting with very credible organisations and very competent people who operate on the ground. Our staff there have already made it clear that we will need to provide additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Member States, I want to pay tribute to the UK, Germany and Sweden. They are the biggest donors. In many cases, they have already delivered their assistance. The Commission and the Member States have a shared competence in this area. Of course, we are cooperating and we would like to see all our commitments fully deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the priorities for our longer-term response are concerned, it is very clear that the economic forecast for Pakistan will have to be revised downwards. In other words, the growth forecast for next year will drop from 4.5% before the floods to maybe 1%, or even to below zero. There has been massive destruction that has yet to be assessed, but it will be in the order of billions. Therefore, it will be necessary to mobilise support for Pakistan in a holistic way. That means that all possible options as to how the support can be provided will be looked into.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Commission has no lending capacity, so debt relief is not something that I can take a stand on from the point of view of what the Commission can do, but one of the options would be to look at Pakistan’s capabilities. We will make sure that your voice is heard as these options are discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, there will be questions about trade and what can be done. I can tell you that Commissioner De Gucht is already very seriously looking into what we can offer through this holistic way of responding to the country’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add one more point. We also have to work with Pakistan to support the government in the reforms they are undertaking in order to get the economy on to a more solid footing – including reforming how they organise their public finances and their budgets – so that the floods do not end up distracting the government from doing the right thing for its own people in the long term. That is also something we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, helping Pakistan is also a matter of political stability in a country that is so very important for its own region and for the rest of the world. In this sense, we very much hope that our collective action will not only save lives but also prevent chaos from erupting in this very sensitive place. In doing so, for those of us who care about the humanitarian side, it is also very important to always stress to the authorities – as I did when I was there – that the security of humanitarian workers is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The other side of that is for us to ensure neutrality. Who we help cannot be based on factors such as religion, gender, or rural or urban location. This matter of the neutrality and safety of humanitarian workers is profoundly important. 19 August was the day of humanitarian workers. On that day, sadly, we noted that last year, we lost more humanitarian workers than peacekeepers. 102 humanitarian workers died. In the context of Pakistan, every day I wake up with great anxiety as to whether a life will be lost in responding to this disaster. I just want to confirm that we take this very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish with the point about strengthening the EU’s disaster response. I am very grateful to those of you who spoke positively of what we have been doing with a view to being better organised and better coordinated. I am also grateful to those who say we need to do more, and I agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just one example of what coordination means in the case of Pakistan. As I said, we deployed our civil protection coordination team in Pakistan. We got 12 Member States to provide in-kind assistance. We organised ten flights as an EU air bridge to Pakistan – two by the Czech Republic, one financed by Finland and seven co-financed by the Commission. We actually brought assistance on behalf of multiple countries in a coordinated fashion and then, in a coordinated fashion, we distributed it on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">So progress is being made but, to those who say that more needs to be done, my response is ‘all power to your voice’. Hopefully, you will see from the Commission a very determined and ambitious way of approaching what it means to have a strong EU disaster response capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is a discussion we will be having in the future, I would sum it up very briefly in four points.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to scenario planning, we need to be much better prepared in anticipating the types of disasters that are to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need pre-determined and committed assets from Member States on which we can rely when a disaster strikes. Whenever we have a disaster and I make a call for assistance, I do not know at the moment of the call whether or not I will get what is necessary. Luckily for me, so far, every time we have called on them, the Member States have come through, but it would be much more prudent if we could predict upfront what the commitment of the Member States is and what assets we have in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns strengthening coordination. I am not going to say more about that. Obviously, we need to get our 27 plus one to act as one.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need a holistic approach to crisis response that incorporates prevention, preparedness, response and rehabilitation feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">These four points are the foundation of the proposal I would present to you.</p>
