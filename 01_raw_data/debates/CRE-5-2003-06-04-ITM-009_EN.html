<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menrad (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report before us by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs relates to the Commission communication on a framework for promoting employee financial participation, in other words, employee participation in profits and productive capital. The communication is intended to kick-start studies and research projects on the opportunities and risks involved in a policy of a broad distribution of assets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the setting up of a working group of independent experts to present proposals to overcome the various problems relating to employee participation. The focus in this context is on transnational obstacles in enterprises operating across national borders concerning different levels of taxation for participants. A detail: my report proposes that, in the case of share options, tax should only be payable when the shares acquired by way of option conversion are successfully sold. This would make sense especially if employees, and not only top-level management, are to be given stock purchase rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary concern of the Commission communication is to strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy in accordance with the Lisbon strategy decisions. The Commission proposed a productivity-related wage policy as far back as the Delors White Paper on Employment. Restraint in terms of cash wage increases, it suggested, would lead to higher profits and thus to investment, in other words to the creation of jobs. The opinion of our committee is that it is not enough to say thank you to employees for their modesty and understanding; instead, on the basis of voluntary schemes, they should have a share in the profits and investments that would not have been possible without their restraint.</p>
<p class="contents">We support and complement the general principles developed by the Commission: first of all, schemes must be voluntary, in other words, both employers and employees must agree to them. Second, all employees must be included in the participation scheme. This means that part-time employees – often women – must not be excluded, in other words, there must be no discrimination against women. Wherever possible, unreasonable risks should be avoided, especially in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises. They face a double risk in the event of insolvency, namely that they could lose both their job and the value of their shares. The Commission has clearly set out its proposals for profit and equity participation in larger enterprises in particular, especially in public limited companies. Here, we could learn from the experience of other countries, especially countries that are models of participatory schemes, such as Britain and France.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends that more consideration should be given to the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, and that participatory schemes which are also feasible for small and medium enterprises should be promoted at national level. The Committees on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Economic and Monetary Affairs and on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have given important answers to the many questions relating to profit and equity participation. They have presented their opinions very well, and I thank them for this. Special thanks also goes to the Commission for its valuable suggestions. The consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were very constructive, for which, thanks once again to all the parliamentary groups and to all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, to conclude, is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on one or two burning issues: first, because employees with equity participation are more motivated, an increase in productivity is likely. This leads to lower unit costs, which increases the volume of sales, with the resulting possibility of creating more jobs. The broad spread of ownership also increases willingness to invest, because fairer distribution of wealth stabilises the structure of society. Second: we need an enterprise law that coordinates co-ownership and cooperation. The new enterprise law must ensure that employees are no longer outsiders, but members of the enterprise. In ‘Quadragesimos Annos’ this is formulated as follows: the work-contract should be developed to become a partnership-contract. Through ownership and participation, employees become co-workers and co-workers become sharers in ownership and management. The goal is to make employees economic citizens with equal rights. Let us embark on the path towards this goal. It is in this spirit that I call upon you to approve the present report.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall start by saying that I think it is very important that both the Commission and Parliament agree that there are huge differences between the institutional frameworks in the Member States and thus it is not possible for us to talk about the need to harmonise legislation and practices between the states in the field we are examining today. It is important that we evaluate the experience of countries in which this model has been used and where it has been proven, in accordance with the studies which we have at our disposal, that it increases the productivity and competitiveness of companies, and use this experience in order to give this practice added European value.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the opinion expressed in the report that the Commission can encourage the older as well as the new Member States which do not have this legislative framework, so that they proceed to a fiscal framework and to an employee financial participation framework, based mainly, as I said, on the results which we have from countries in which it is applied. Within this framework, I am delighted to say that the Commission welcomes the setting up of the group of independent experts, which has already started work and will report to us in October and which is currently examining the obstacles faced by companies that wish to apply the employee participation system but have companies in more than one country, which is basically a serious obstacle to large companies operating at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would highlight the need, to which Mr Menrad also refers, for national practices and national legislation to follow a series of principles, the most important of which is the need to minimise the financial risks to employees.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concludes with specific proposals calling on the Commission to conduct a comparative performance analysis between countries and models, to undertake studies on the forms of participation which are most suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises, where the problems are different, and to proceed to draft a paper on trade union and management aspects, attaching, of course, special importance to the issue of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure you with regard to all the foregoing that the Commission will promote all these proposals to the greatest possible extent and to say that, as we speak, the Commission is already drafting a study on precisely this subject, in cooperation with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, together with a framework of comparative evaluation indicators. Once this study is completed, the Commission will come back and submit a new report and this report will be within the framework of the actions to which we committed in the Commission communication for 2000-2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I also thank the Secretariat for scheduling this debate, yet again, at such a late hour, even though it means that some of us who started in this House at breakfast time have already been here for over 13 hours. I must confess that I am again in contravention of the EU Working Time Directive and, as a good European, I should not break European law. I am sure I would be in the Commission's bad books by so doing. I hope I will be forgiven, at least on this one occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the spirit in which he has approached this complicated subject and the way in which he has embraced amendments from all sides, certainly including some of my own. I would make just one tiny criticism – which I hope he will not take as nit-picking, as we say in the UK – but it is a compliment to him, rather than a criticism. I felt that his original version of one of the recitals was better than the compromise. Recital D stated ‘whereas it is neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise the rules for financial participation schemes, as this would impede the flexibility of Member States' policies’. That was absolutely spot on. But, as he knows, there was a compromise with the PSE Group that stated ‘<span class="italic">as yet</span> neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise <span class="italic">fully</span>’. That was perhaps a mistake, because there is no need whatsoever to harmonise policies in this respect. We are exactly on the right lines as we are. But that is a very small point. I am very much in sympathy with the thrust of his report. Personally I will be supporting his report wholeheartedly and I shall be encouraging all my colleagues to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore also like to thank Mr Menrad for incorporating the ideas, proposals and wishes of the Socialist Group, as well as my own as shadow rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Employee participation in the ownership of productive wealth was actually a far more topical issue fifty years ago than it is today. For this reason too, I think it is a good thing that in Europe, we are reviving this concept and these opportunities, and now that the internal market has been created, are giving employees this opportunity. Nowadays, however, we are perhaps in a more difficult situation because we are in competition with other models for which state incentives must be provided, such as company and private pension schemes. However, one thing must be clear to us all: models of employee part-ownership of productive wealth can only be implemented in practice if state incentives are provided. These, of course, are more difficult to achieve at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this proposal, these ideas, the drafts and, perhaps at a later stage, a directive, is not only to create new jobs – although that is important. Nor is the aim simply to raise productivity – although we naturally expect this as well. No, the aim is also to achieve a more just distribution of added value. We can only expect workers to show consideration for companies' profit levels or, indeed, exercise wage restraint if the distribution ratio between labour and capital is not shifted to their disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with Mr Menrad that the primary task is not harmonisation but better coordination, more information and – as part of a directive, of course – a voluntary approach. We expect employees to be protected from the risks associated with bankruptcies. We expect the more problematic groups to be included as well, such as the small and medium enterprises – SMEs. We expect low-wage workers and women who have a different working career, a different work situation, to be included too.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Commission will take up all our ideas and, on that basis, will work with us to produce a more far-reaching initiative, perhaps next year, which can then lead to a more just distribution of productive wealth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recent events relating to the collapse of various companies that had systems of employee participation in capital demonstrate the potential risks linked to this system. The case of <span class="italic">Enron</span> and others like it show how crucial it is to study the consequences of applying existing systems, to look more closely at the various alternatives for participation, whether they are associated with pension plans or linked to participation in capital, profits or share options.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous experiences not only warn us of the risks but also raise many doubts about the incentive that employee participation schemes might provide for job creation and about the dangers of these being used in order to get around labour legislation and to call into question workers’ rights, specifically in the field of pay, work organisation and hours, equal opportunities for men and women and maternity and paternity rights. We must all bear in mind the increasing volatility of the financial markets. Applying the private profit approach to the financial resources of national pension systems and, to some extent, the salaries and savings of employees, which is what the financial participation of employees entails, means increasing the risk of financial crises and the socio-economic consequences of these, as the rapporteur in fact states: it means putting employees at a dual risk because in the event of the company’s bankruptcy they will lose both their job and the value of their shares.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obviously various types of financial participation that could generate management schemes. The discussion is not, however, about the ‘how’ but more about the basic ‘aim’ of the proposal. We cannot allow it to be used to interfere in the process of setting salaries and to exert pressure for making the labour market more flexible. Our fellow Member Mr Menrad has sought to establish some rules, specifically on collective bargaining, arguing that pay increases should not be conducted at the same time as negotiations on financial participation or even that employee participation must be an additional element and must not replace the normal salary or other pay components such as pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The option of signing up to participation schemes must clearly always be voluntary and never lead to discrimination between employees or call into question other forms of participation in company life, particularly in the field of union activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps greater participation and, thus, also a greater acceptance of responsibility can even help make companies more successful and profitable and so contribute to increased employment and increased access to capital. Some people even maintain that the development of various types of financial participation systems could be a possible way of achieving increased growth and faster compliance with the Lisbon strategy objectives. That would be a mercy worth quietly asking for, since the Lisbon objectives appear more and more to be taking on the character of illusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the case may be, profit-sharing systems of various kinds can in any event create good incentives for employees, give rise to greater enthusiasm for the job in hand and strengthen the link between company and employees. To that extent, we are in agreement, Mr Menrad. When it comes to these aspects of the content of the report, I think that Mr Menrad has done some quite excellent work and carried out a good analysis of the problems that, in spite of everything, are involved in this issue. I do not however share the view that this is something that should be decided or debated at EU level. The rapporteur has himself written in the report that it is unnecessary to harmonise the provisions for financial participation systems and that it is neither desirable nor practicable to do so, either, because it would impede the flexibility of Member States’ policies. I agree with that. Subsequently, Mr Menrad says, however, that a European framework is needed for the promotion of employee financial participation through the coordination of agreements on general principles, social security issues and fiscal aspects. Why, though? The coordination of models and conditions would benefit neither companies nor employees. I therefore see no reason why any of the EU institutions should have any dealings with this issue, with its host of specific requirements and considerations of which it will be necessary also to take account. Companies’ profit-sharing systems are the concern of companies and their employees, and it is therefore with them that this issue should reside.</p>

Once again, you have shown yourself to be a worthy champion of employees' interests. Is this a theme for the European Union? It certainly is! The reason is that employee participation has an absolutely innovative character, both on the company and the employee side. That is the approach, and that is the new philosophy, which we must adopt if we want to pursue the Lisbon objectives. That is what I would say to the previous speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is important to distinguish between specific things as Mr Menrad himself has done. We are assuming that these are clear capital shareholdings which cannot supplement the existing wage and salaries systems. They must be dealt with separately, and that is a factor. We are assuming, and this has already been expounded upon, that the participation sector or participation in the industrial sector will therefore become far stronger. It has a psychological effect. It has an effect on the company. It is innovative, and holds promise for the future. That is how it has been presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet what age are we living in? That now applies to the Commission as well. The task is to integrate these specific models of employee participation into a specific network for the present day, in other words, to encourage employees to take an interest in obtaining shareholdings in companies.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the reality in Europe? We have recessional and deflationary trends, characterised by the Commission's growing pressure to make savings. As a result, pensions and social systems are being cut, and this does not make employees more willing to acquire shares in the corporate sector. That is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, if we want to make policies for the European Union, we should get down to brass tacks: we should create systems which are equipped with appropriate flanking measures so that everything can come together to form a creative whole. That is actually what we want. This cannot be the case as long there are quite different economic tendencies on the one side from our own, with our ideas, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Employee participation must not be just a theory. Employee participation in the Lisbon sense means more than that!</p>
