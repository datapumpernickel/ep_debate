<p class="contents">In recent months, a turning point was reached with the constitutional Convention, which gave space policy a specific role, thus representing a legal base for Community programmes and consolidating the strategy begun with the extraordinary success of the Galileo programme. Nevertheless, we must not disregard the fact that the Commission has also given a specific response to the unprecedented crisis that has struck the space sector, specifically launchers, undermining the activity of many industries and accentuating distortions of the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">The space asset<span class="italic"> </span>is crucial to the concentration of professional expertise, research and technology, which characterise the development of the knowledge-based economy. It is a resource that cannot be wasted and the Commission and the European Space Agency Council have shown that they are fully aware of this. Parliament’s report stresses the role of the ESA and national agencies, and expresses its satisfaction with the framework agreement, which the European Community and the ESA supported and Parliament strongly pressed for. This framework agreement confirms the unique role of the ESA in organising research and technological and industrial development. This role must be specified in a European space programme that redefines the responsibilities of the Commission in the face of public demand and new initiatives that call for political representativeness and a specific institutional competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving Europe a role as leader on the international stage, involving all the EU countries is not incompatible with the firm belief that international cooperation is necessary: cooperation, in the first instance, with the United States – thinking here of the International Space station – but also with other countries, including Russia, Japan and China itself. We must, however, be aware that the quality of international agreements – in particular those relating to space – depends on the quality of scientific, industrial and also financial support. Europe’s goals have to be supported by public resources, as is the case across the world, and by more active organisation of common policies in fields such as agriculture, telecommunications, the environment and transport. We need to give stimulus to private initiatives, as is the case with Galileo, but we need to take note that the objective of doubling the space budget in ten years will only go part way towards bridging the gap with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Space science has played a pioneering role. The quality of human resources and basic research, however, warrants greater attention. The future of the European Space policy depends on this being given. This is why we believe that the next framework programme for research should dedicate more funding to the space sector, guaranteeing a quota in this field for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are becoming an indispensable support for new innovative enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the Convention’s guideline for an arms agency that is open to all the Member States, according to the structured cooperation method. This guideline can help to implement the industrial and technological asset. This is not – and we need to make this clear – about militarising space, but rather about recognising that this is about twofold activities, both military and civil, as well as a strategy for European security that cannot be abandoned because of the temptations of US unilateralism. To avoid misinterpretations, the report refers to the United Nations resolution on prevention of an arms race in outer space and to the Convention itself, which proposes to promote peace and to contribute to security and sustainable development on earth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now looking forward to the White Paper, after discussing the Green Paper. Our expectations are based on the positive opinions that we have expressed thus far and they are, we believe, the expectations of the scientific world and the European industrial world too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This once again demonstrates Parliament’s commitment to and support of space. The consultation on the Green Paper provided the opportunity for a very open debate on the future of space exploration in Europe and to examine many contributions from all sectors. On this basis, we are now committed to preparing the White Paper on the medium and long-term objectives for European Space policy, as Parliament asked of the Commission in January 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Some crucial points of convergence have materialised. The first is that Europe needs a high-level space policy that is independent and ongoing. The second point is the acknowledgement that our space industry is structurally vulnerable. As you have pointed out, we did have problems where launchers are concerned, and a decision by the ESA Council helped us to find a solution, albeit one which will only be useful in the short- and medium-term. We must now find a more structural solution. Lastly, it is crucial that we take a closer interest in the space telecommunications sector in order to increase demand and to maintain skills in our industry.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point concerns the European Union’s new responsibilities in space-related matters. In the Union’s new political context, the approaches of the European Space Agency and of the national space agencies must be combined into a joint vision that will create a genuine space policy at European level. To this end, I welcome the agreement reached between the ESA and the EU at the Council of 22 September: this is a crucial step.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, a space policy must be a horizontal Union policy, which serves other policies too. It would set out strategy and would contain the guidelines that would help to ensure a coherent European space effort. It should cover not only the civilian domain but also aspects of security and defence. Formulating such a policy would, of course, require a clear legal base in the future Treaty and this is the intention of the Convention proposal seeking to grant the Union competences in the domain of space that it would share with the Member States. The Commission, like Parliament, hopes that this proposal will be accepted without amendment at the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet I am constantly being asked what Europe is really looking for in space, and why Europe should spend money on space when there are other problems on Earth that are so pressing and in need of high levels of funding. So, although I do not expect this issue to meet with either rejoicing or unqualified approval, my firm conviction, which I know to be shared by many of my fellow-MEPs, is that space is of strategic importance for Europe and for the European economy. Thanks to new technologies, it provides new opportunities. It provides jobs for our engineers and prospects for the future. Europe must not be satisfied with technological achievements that are less than first-class, and Europe is capable of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of fact rather than a secret that space policy is one of the core issues for the twenty-first century. Our everyday lives are already being shaped by the most varied applications made possible by space and the satellites we have put into it, behind which lies technological know-how that needs to be nurtured. We, in Europe, have valuable resources, by which I mean not only engineers and technicians, but also research establishments and enterprises. These give rise to innovations, but, as I keep being told, and as I have heard this afternoon, researchers and brainpower go where more is on offer, not only financially, but also in terms of technology. That, Commissioner Busquin, is why I believe there to be an urgent need for real efforts to be made towards a coherent European space policy, as you have so aptly described it. Europe must become aware of where it stands and of what opportunities it has. No longer must we make declarations; now is the time for us to at last take action. Europe must also be willing to invest, and, while there is no doubt that this can sometimes be a painful business, the space sector is not only highly cost-intensive, but also highly competitive. Let us then take up this challenge!</p>
<p class="contents">Without decisiveness and commitment, Europe will lose independent access to space, and will also lose out when it comes to the applications resulting from it. Commissioner Busquin, I share your view of the dangers of dependence on others, and so I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper on European space policy and Mr Bodrato’s detailed and stimulating report. Europe needs a political signal to begin a new chapter in space travel, and I hope that we will, by a clear resolution tomorrow, help to give European space travel the right impetus! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guido Bodrato, for the remarkable work he has done and for the ability he has demonstrated to listen to divergent opinions and to reconcile them. I believe that this is an altogether remarkable document.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is particularly exciting because it comes at the end of what has been a historical period for space, thanks in particular to the crucial boost given by Mr Philippe Busquin and his staff. Indeed, for the first time, Europe is outlining something other than a policy to regulate competition and the internal market. It is drawing up a genuinely proactive industrial and technological policy which I hope will reassure all those who sometimes doubt whether Europe provides any real benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has achieved these results firstly through Galileo, which has given us the opportunity to create the first European mixed investment company, in other words, a joint company that will support an industrial and technological project. It has also done so by laying the foundations, with the help of the Green Paper, of a space policy that acknowledges that space is a major technology by dint of the importance of its applications in all spheres, including the civilian; a policy that acknowledges the need for proactive political support; a policy that recognises the need to uphold our independence with regard to the emerging powers. This is a point of which Commissioner Busquin has reminded us and one that we feel is extremely important. At the same time, we must remain open to the world because, in the background, extremely fruitful cooperation is taking place with the USA, with Russia, over the Soyuz system at Kourou and with China over Galileo. In other words, space is entering a new era: an era of growing influence for the European Union as a space power that can act completely independently of the world’s superpowers against the backdrop of a crisis, in particular the crisis besetting public budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to follow the direction set out in the White Paper. I personally hope that relations between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Union improve. We need the ESA and its skills, but we also need the Union and its political support if we are going to be able to speak with a single voice in the first division. I also wish to see institutional consolidation within the Commission. Because the Treaty provides for space competence to be shared at European level, the Commission will have to ensure that full use is made of this competence. In this regard, I wish to express my attachment to the framework programmes for research and development and for the ‘aeronautical-space line’, which appears for the first time in the sixth FPRD. I am also committed to developing a culture of programmes and the capacity to launch sectoral European programmes through the other Commission services. Having said that, I am thinking in particular of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) for the environment and of the follow-ups to Lisbon for education.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Busquin and Mr Bodrato and say that this is a fine example of a dossier in which Europe can do most when it moves ahead with political will. I offer my best wishes for success and continuity for what we have managed to achieve together in the five years of our mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, this Green Paper demonstrates an awareness of the importance for Europe of developing the space sector in industrial, strategic and also political terms. Last May, we held a debate on the future of this sector, in light of a serious crisis related to fierce world competition and to funding problems. The Green Paper, the Bodrato report and the newly announced White Paper contain practical proposals that could ultimately help us to overcome this crisis and finally add some real ambition to an independent European space policy. To this end, I welcome the outcome of the Galileo programme and I share the stated desire to develop Community integration. I do hope, however, that this integration will not call into question the independent competences of the space agency in its role as programme coordinator and leader.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address two issues. The report insists on the need to create synergies between civilian and military activities – I heard Mr Bodrato’s words quite clearly – whilst advocating the use of space for peaceful purposes, which I support. He hopes that the satellite systems will benefit not only transport and the environment, but also security, so that Europe has its own strategy, management body and its own resources. All well and good, but I am convinced that priority should be given to the use of space for peaceful purposes: the needs are enormous, whether we are talking about the environment or about risk management. Europe must not fall in line with the US model, which gives priority to research and development in the military sphere above any potential civilian applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, one crucial aspect of an ambitious European space policy concerns funding. The report emphasises that the provision of public funds is crucial to the development of space programmes. There is a major contradiction between the Union’s stated aims and reality. There has been no increase in the budgets allocated to Europe’s space agencies, whereas the US dedicates six times more public funds to space than do all the European countries put together. The Union must, as a matter of urgency, release funding that matches the ambitions it has stated. This is also a requirement for Community integration and, as I see it, only public funds can guarantee long-term investment, which is crucial in the space industry, as is maintaining high-level skills. This is a prerequisite for an independent, dynamic European space policy that uses cutting-edge technology and which creates high-quality jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be realistic; in other words, it must make sense in the context of US and Russian space policy and act as a driving force for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Bodrato on his report, which has the merit of expressing this desire. We feel, however, that it focuses too much on military applications, which are not the intended aim of this policy. This is why we are proposing Galileo, which will be a purely civilian organisation, as opposed to the USA’s GPS system or the Russian Glonass, which are under military control. We propose to support Article 150 of the Convention under discussion, so that space forms part of European policy as a whole. A joint organisation must be set up at European level and the European Space Agency (ESA) must be more a tool of this integrated policy than an intergovernmental body. Work in the space sector must form part of the context of the European research area and the bulk of resources allocated to this field should be shared by the Union’s Member States. All players involved in space policy and in particular the European Parliament which supports our space policy must sit down at the same table. Our group will set great store by these proposals and will pay close attention when the White Paper on space, which is due to be submitted to us by the end of the year, is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
