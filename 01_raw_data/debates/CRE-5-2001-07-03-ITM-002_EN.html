<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank my fellow Members for their cooperation during the discussions, and in particular Jimmy Provan for the very fair opinion that he has just presented here in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am going to stir things up a little. I say that quite simply because we should not forget that our amendments at second reading last December have been at the heart of this debate. We wanted to create a level playing field in Europe as regards company takeovers. It is quite clear that the result that emerged from the Conciliation Committee did not give us what we wanted. Parliament offered all kinds of compromises during the negotiations. Jimmy Provan has explained that a compromise was not reached because the Council rejected any kind of compromise, dug its heels in over the key issue in its common position, and was absolutely unwilling to budge a single millimetre. One of our offers for a compromise, one of the last that we made, was for a directive on the level playing field to come into force. This is, by the way, something we proposed some time ago, and which the Council, as I discovered last weekend, has had before it since 1972, that is to say much longer than the 12 years that have been mentioned here. The entry into force of the duty of neutrality is to be made conditional on such a level playing field directive coming into force. Even this, although it really seems quite self-evident, was rejected by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There was merely agreement with the idea of the Commission convening a group of experts to address this subject and then possibly develop some proposals. I would like to know what the logic is of convening a group of experts once the directive has already been adopted. Normally, you set up the group of experts first and then adopt a directive on the subject in question. I am not convinced at all by the procedure being adopted here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore come to the conclusion that this is not so much a compromise as a capitulation by the majority of the Parliament delegation in the face of the Council's position. All this in the context of a number of important decisions going through the conciliation procedure. I have in mind, for example, the Directive on money-laundering , the whole subject of the Lamfalussy follow-up, and everything else in that area. I believe that if we agree to this directive, we are debasing the institutional role of this House, and for that reason alone we should not agree. Quite apart from that, there are any number of objective reasons why we cannot agree to it. The result of this directive will be that in future protected companies will be able to take over unprotected companies. That is the clear consequence of this. Because if we do not have a level playing field, if national legislation in certain Member States makes it permissible to protect companies by limitations on voting rights, by golden shares, by multiple voting rights, by a variety of means of intervention by the administration, and if this is in fact not the case in other Member States, then I would like to know where the level playing field is. Alternatively, let me draw a comparison between the United States and Europe. The Americans have gone in exactly the opposite direction. They have introduced a "business judgment rule" according to which company boards can protect themselves if they wish, whereas in Europe we forbid that. So what will the results of a decision of this kind be, if it is easier for American companies to take over European companies than the other way round? Furthermore, the trend in America also gives the lie to much of what we have been able to read in the papers this morning. The papers always maintain that things would degenerate into chaos or that it would have a negative impact on Europe's financial market if we suddenly rejected this directive. The American experience suggests the opposite, they have gone down exactly the opposite path, and no one could say that America's stock market is less dynamic than Europe's. So it is evident that these connections do not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you about the vital concept of location advantages. Delaware is a state that has relatively restrictive legislation on company takeovers. It is interesting to note that 40% of the companies quoted on the New York stock exchange are based in Delaware, rising to 60% of indexed companies. My question to you is: why should that be? I can only suggest that I believe these conditions to be a very important factor when companies make decisions about their location. No one has anything against protecting shareholders. I am a shareholder myself. So it goes without saying of course, as a matter of logic, that like most individuals who are shareholders, I am in favour of protecting shareholders, but on equal terms. The phrase used by Jimmy Provan, "one share – one vote", simply does not apply in Europe. That is the key problem. Because this phrase does not apply, it would be wrong at this stage to introduce strict neutrality which would ultimately lead to major imbalances in Europe and would thus probably harm the internal market more than benefit it. To sum up, the Swedish Prime Minister called the directive unique. I agree – in its present form, it is uniquely bad. That is why it must be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Provan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as chairman of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, may I thank all concerned who were involved in achieving a result on this directive. I would like to thank the presidency for its work, and the European Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular who acted as a facilitator. Thanks also to all my colleagues on Parliament's delegation who went through numerous tortuous meetings and lost a night's sleep in Luxembourg trying to achieve this result. Also, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who throughout conducted a robust defence of the European Parliament's position and his own views.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the delegation's considerations is before us today and we have to adopt or reject the joint text agreed in Luxembourg on 6 June. This power of rejection or acceptance is a power granted to the European Parliament under the Amsterdam Treaty. The Commission and Council have been working for 12 years to achieve rules and safeguards that are acceptable across all Member States. They achieved this only to find that the European Parliament took a different stance on a number of issues and articles.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifteen amendments in Parliament's second reading were not acceptable to the Council. On 29 May, we reached agreement on 8 amendments, leaving three major areas of contention: defensive measures, squeeze-out and minority shareholders and the level playing field. Squeeze-out and minority shareholders have been the subject of a Commission declaration, and a group of company law experts is being set up to look at the overall situation – including the equitable price. Also, we had difficulties with the Council on employee rights to information.</p>
<p class="contents">On all these issues, Parliament's delegation made strong representations to the Council in the negotiations and won many concessions. Indeed, from most points of view, it could and would be assumed that the negotiations were a success. However, Article 9 and Amendments Nos 20 and 17, in particular, remained a point of fundamental difference. The history is therefore important in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifteen Member States reached common accord and a common position, along with the Commission. That meant that there were two European institutions in agreement whilst the European Parliament took a different position. One Member State then withdrew from the common position – the first time this has ever happened. The Council was then in the position of being unable to concede anything to Parliament by way of negotiation on these matters. Had it done so, all 14 Member States would have felt cheated, having already conceded much to achieve a common position. For one Member State to achieve something, having withdrawn from the common position, would have caused the Council great difficulty in future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Parliament's delegation was in a very difficult position. I say to Parliament that the delegation itself was divided on the main issue, and that is not a happy position for the chairman of a delegation. The European Parliament had already made its decision clear, and what it wanted was to achieve a directive. We had to take a decision. A vote in the delegation was necessary and that vote was achieved. We had the minimum majority required to approve the negotiation with the Council, and indeed had the support of the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">My own position as chairman was made clear and well understood. While fighting for the powers of the European Parliament, it would have been wrong for half of the delegation to have rejected this directive one late night in Luxembourg, without the full Parliament having the opportunity of the third reading we are having today.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue is whether managers of companies are in control or whether shareholders that own the company should decide. In other words: one man, one vote. Today we have a third reading and, tomorrow, a vote to accept or reject this proposal. I recommend that the European Parliament accept the outcome of this negotiation, otherwise we will do serious damage to Europe's future economic development. We might also do serious damage to the European Parliament, as the European press seems to be totally opposed, along with the Council and the Commission, to what we want to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will take as my starting point the position which was adopted at the second reading of the European Parliament on 13 December 2000 with 399 votes for the motion. An amendment adopted at this time radically changed Article 9 of the common position, enabling an administrative board to take defensive measures without consulting the shareholders once the bid has been made public. The defensive measures could have been subject to prior authorisation of the supervisory authority by the administrative board or in response to a request from shareholders holding at least 1% of the voting rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we had conciliation. Conciliation was a lengthy operation on an extremely difficult subject. In view of the Council's downright refusal to take this amendment into account, amongst other things, we presented a substantial series of compromise solutions which ranged from the possibility of shareholders holding 20% of the voting rights requesting that a meeting be convened to discuss defensive measures to the introduction of a clause linking the entry into force of the directive on takeover bids to the entry into force of a directive creating a sort of level playing field, that is common rules of play under European company law. Nothing was achieved and the Council continued to refuse any form of compromise we proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall, amongst other things – and I am reminding myself more than anyone – that a proposal for a directive whose objective is to create a level playing field does exist: the fifth directive on company law, concerning the obligations of shareholders and third parties in respect of the structure of public limited companies and the powers and obligations of their social organs. This proposal was adopted by the Commission in 1972 and then lay untouched in the Council's drawers for over 10 years pending the common position, after which the European Parliament expressed its opinion on it on several occasions. The five years necessary to transpose ....</p>

In the Council, a minority opposes it and Parliament is divided more or less down the middle, given that in the delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the final evening of debate, the voting was concluded with 8 votes for and 6 against, with one Member abstaining. I would say that the divisions now also extend to the various political groups. My own Group will decide this afternoon on how it will vote, which means that until tomorrow we will probably not know for sure whether or not the directive will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by saying that I disagree with Mr Provan’s assessment of a possible rejection of this directive. Because the problem we face is whether, as a consequence of the directive being adopted, European businesses – as Mr Lehne pointed out – could be held to ransom by the major international financial operators, who are known colloquially as the ‘Sharks of Wall Street’. This is the danger we are currently facing and, as a Member of this Parliament, I state my intention, of course, to vote against the directive, because I believe that the danger of our businesses being devoured by these financial operators, and of being stripped to the bone if they have assets – I am talking here about heavily capitalised companies – immediately condemning workers to unemployment, is much greater than the alternative danger, which is that the operation of the internal market may be impeded. As Mr Lehne pointed out, the Americans themselves have adopted the rather expeditious solution of having at least one State – Delaware – in which highly capitalised companies can be based and where the monitoring of these companies by financial sharks can be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to public opinion or the press, I also disagree with Mr Provan, because his words do not match what is written in the newspapers that I read. In my opinion, a vote against, at this time, by the European Parliament on an issue as important and significant as this would enhance the prestige of this institution. Because the information that I have from governmental institutions indicates that many governments would probably change their position within the Council if they were aware of the impact of this issue on the business world and, above all, on the unions. Now, in the formula laid down in the proposed directive, the workers are the unwanted guests. The workers are invited to the table but they cannot join in. They cannot take part in the meal and cannot take part in the decision-making. They are simply informed of the decision that is to be taken and, once it is taken, the document provided by the workers is just seen as another document – similar to what the Council does when Parliament has a consultative role – and then the decision is reached without any account being taken of the workers’ opinions. I and most of the Members of the Socialist Group will, therefore, probably vote against adopting this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He did a marvellous job in very difficult circumstances. I should like to say, on behalf of the ELDR Group, that we are fully and undividedly behind the agreement reached in conciliation and will vote accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the reasons have been well rehearsed before and we have heard some of them again this morning. This directive is crucial, indeed critical, to the financial services action plan. Therefore if we are genuinely interested in the competitiveness and good functioning of Europe's economy, we have to proceed with this directive. My Group believes that it is in the long-term interests of Europe's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I want us to consider the interests of those we are really trying to protect with this directive, namely the minority shareholders, so that we can begin to secure investment and ownership in enterprises across Europe. It is now beginning to be the case, and will increasingly be so in future, that many of those investors are Europe's citizens investing for their future, savings and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have shown that citizens are becoming increasingly frustrated with the inability of politicians to deal with the effects of globalisation and other aspects of corporate life. For example it seems quite possible that a group of motivated shareholders may be beginning to achieve an about-turn on the projected building of the Ilisu dam in Turkey. Shareholders can act against the Wall Street sharks. Shareholders are property owners; they have rights and responsibilities which can be exercised in many ways this House would wish to endorse. Shareholders will often also be employees.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation result represents a substantial compromise. This directive has the potential to be the means to allow our citizens to be investors in the future of Europe's enterprise and to secure the health and vitality of our economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As one of the majority at the conciliation group in Luxembourg on 5 June, my primary motive in voting was to ensure that Parliament would have the chance to vote on this third reading. It would have been a scandal if, at 1 a.m. in Luxembourg on 5 June, 15 of us had voted it down and prevented Parliament having this debate. We can assure all those visiting this House today that there will not be a more important decision affecting the well-being of industry in Europe than this one. My group will have a free vote on it and I believe others will as well. We will, as individual Members of Parliament, stand by our consciences on this issue at tomorrow's vital vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I feel I am living in a looking glass land when I hear that all sorts of disastrous takeovers will occur if the directive is carried. Members must remember that takeovers will go on in all events. The issue is whether we have a common set of norms in Europe which govern us all. Will we have a single basic law for takeovers or will we let the chaos continue?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne makes a powerful point about the damage that can be done by golden shares, about the unfairness of the absence of a level playing field. We will not move closer to a level playing field by throwing out this directive. That will make it impossible over the next decade to get anywhere near a level playing field. We must, therefore, move forward on this occasion. It would be shocking not to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It will probably take four years, if we carry this tomorrow, before it comes into effect. Trade unionists and employees of companies throughout Europe will still have to wait four years to get what Mr Medina Ortega already regards as not enough. But they have far less at the moment. If the directive goes through, the board of a bidding or offeree company will have to declare its hand at the time of the bid. It will have to declare its intentions in regard to jobs and the location of work. The trade unions or other employees' representatives will have the right to comment on that before the offeree company comes to a decision. The shareholders of the offeree company will need to know what the view of the employees is. None of this is law at the moment. We are about to deprive people of something of vital importance, unless we carry this! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strength of the euro itself will depend on the strength and attractiveness of the financial markets. The competitiveness of public limited companies is an essential factor for an efficient capital market which is geared to the creation and protection of value<span class="bold"> </span>for large and, in particular, small shareholders. In this sense, precisely the most disputed article of the directive – Article 9 – is a step in the right direction towards providing, within the single European market, a reliable, homogeneous legislative framework for public takeover bids. This is why the Italian radicals of the Bonino List are going to vote for the directive. Moreover, when we refer to the United States model, I feel that it is not right to pick and choose: either we take the entire model, Mr Lehne, or else we reject the model completely.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks, the conservatives and protectionists, who have opposed this measure, have had a wonderful excuse in the shape of the asymmetries between the different countries. The case of<span class="bold"> </span>the bid by what was actually a subsidiary of<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">Electricité de France</span> to take control of the second Italian private electricity group, <span class="italic">Montedison</span>, is symbolic. <span class="italic">EDF</span> is a company which is not quoted on the Stock Exchange, which is 100% the property of the French government and which enjoys a legal monopoly in France. Clearly, its aggressive policy of shopping around in Europe is an intolerable distortion of the European capital market. In promising to reinforce competitiveness and competition in the markets of some public services, we are letting statism and monopolistic management in by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, in order to avoid these types of operations prompting reactions such as the golden share, block decrees or rejection of legislation such as that which is to be put to the vote tomorrow on the competitiveness of companies, it is necessary for the Commission to intervene with its powers with regard to State aid and abuse and facilitation of dominant positions, to prevent these asymmetries from destroying the European capital market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When publicly listed companies are subject to possible takeovers they should be able to take defensive measures, but when management acts it must behave even-handedly towards all shareholders in any one class. That must be included in the rules. If that does not happen, the integrity of the market is eroded. That leads to an unwillingness of capital to invest and thus under-capitalisation, and hence under-performance of Europe's economy. In turn, pension funds will not be able to secure proper retirement provision for their members and the currency will weaken. This conciliation has seen 15 new provisions introduced into the common position, so it cannot be maintained seriously that Parliament's rights have been trampled on. To claim that could undermine our credibility in the future when we may have real cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of having a takeover directive has been supported at first and second readings and now, after 12 years, we have a final agreed text. In this Parliament we frequently complain that we are unfairly perceived as immature and irresponsible, and hence disregarded. Let us now prove these critics wrong and vote for the conciliation. It is one which most commentators and all but one European country, Germany – a country which I normally hold in esteem but which welched on a unanimously agreed position of the Council – support. This, as Mr MacCormick very lucidly pointed out, is the first step towards creating a single market in corporate ownership. It is an integral component of the single market and is in the interests of all Europe's citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we look closely at what has happened, we will reach the conclusion that, so far, the system has not worked.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that it is difficult for decisions to be reached in Council, for governments holding divergent positions and countries with different legal traditions to reach agreement, but I have the feeling, or rather I am certain, that this consensus in Council is being sought with no awareness at all of the European Parliament’s thoughts on the legislation’s content. Of course, when agreement is reached within the Council, any proposal by Parliament which goes against this comes to be seen as a threat to an agreement that has been reached, sometimes <span class="italic">in extremis </span>and which may hang in the balance. In these circumstances, the Council ultimately becomes intransigent and adopts a position that always implies: either you do what we say or the law will not be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Provan’s words have shown that the Council has attached less importance to achieving an agreement with the European Parliament than to the feeling that a certain country would not meet a commitment that it had previously given.</p>
<p class="contents">When Parliament studied the content of the common position at second reading, it was particularly concerned about two issues: workers’ participation and the obligation to neutrality imposed on boards of management.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these two items, a majority of the European Parliament had the audacity to oppose what had previously been decided on in Council. I consider it to be extremely serious that no consideration was given at first reading to the positions of the European Parliament on workers and their representatives being fully informed and being able to state their opinion on the takeover of their companies and this justifies the European Parliament’s opposition to the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the fact that this Parliament sought a balance between those for and against allowing defensive manoeuvres, far from deserving the criticism heaped upon it by certain self-interested sectors, should have their gratitude, because the European Parliament’s position was not to allow any type of defensive manoeuvring as was suggested, with considerable bias, to the media. You simply have to study the content of the amendments tabled to see that this statement is false.</p>

In my opinion, the guiding principle we should all abide by is not only to talk about the internal market, but also about the European social model, as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon model.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, we will be talking to one of the Commissioners about socially responsible entrepreneurship. And that means that we will not only be talking about shareholders, but also about stakeholders, along with consumers, environmental organisations and employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and consultation are also currently under discussion. Not simply information, therefore, but also consultation. Having a say in the broad sense of the word. We are looking into the request to review the Works Councils Act. We argue in favour of an observatory for industrial change. That is what is happening on the one hand. On the other hand, there are also people who would like to see a European company statute, and who want takeover bids to be regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we should be sufficiently grown-up, to slowly but surely reach a package deal in which matters of this kind can be regulated in one fell swoop. At the moment, however, we are witness to a more gradual approach. Returning to this Directive, I gather from Articles 6 and 9 d), in particular, that these are only concerned with disclosure of information. I am drawing on my practical experience as advisor to works councils and trade unions, when I encountered difficulties of this kind on a daily basis. With regard to this directive, one could revert back to a situation where all that is required is information and where one hardly has the time to form one’s own opinion. This being the case, to say that the opinion may be sent along with a bid is a hollow phrase. I have heard such hollow phrases all too often, and I do not welcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are about to see, therefore, is a very strange coalition tomorrow, with divisions within all the political parties. I naturally defend the proportion, and that will be the largest proportion, of the Greens who will be voting against. A strange coalition indeed, made up of people who defend the pearls of their national industries, as well as people who stand up for more say and better consultation as a matter of principle. I quite definitely belong to the second group. As Mr Simpson has said in connection with the postal issue, I would have liked the ayatollah of liberalisation to have had a bit more nerve and to have regulated this consultation aspect properly from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I do not see eye to eye with him today, for I am of the opinion that the mediation outcome should be rejected for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the proposal conflicts with legislation and practices in my own country, the Netherlands. Although the Dutch Finance Minister may well have stated in a letter yesterday to the Dutch Parliament that the Directive should, in his opinion, be introduced, whoever seeks advice from the social partners in the Netherlands knows better. In fact, until two years ago, the Dutch government was also opposed to this directive. Things can change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch system makes provision for protecting companies against hostile takeovers. It aims to afford the Board of the target partnership the opportunity of weighing up all the vested interests in the event of a hostile bid. In this connection, the Board must have the company’s continuity in mind. The approach in Mr Bolkestein’s proposal is completely different. It leaves the decision concerning a hostile bid to the shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">A second argument against Mr Bolkestein’s proposal is the inequality which it creates within Europe. Article 9 only prohibits the legal protection structures. All other methods of countering company takeovers, such as government intervention, are being left out of the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, one final point. One of the arguments used in favour of adopting the directive is that it has undergone a great deal of doctoring for twelve years and that, if the compromise is rejected, all the work will have been in vain. That is not an argument, in my opinion. Mr Bolkestein has agreed to have studies carried out into a number of points. Besides, I am of the opinion that studies should have been carried out during the twelve years of preparation, not after adopting the directive, but that is just by the by. The Commission could prepare a fresh proposal for a directive very quickly which, if handled intelligently, could indeed provide a level playing field in Europe and could enter into force before the current proposal, which, after all, has a five-year transitional period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It involves give and take on both sides. As part of the European legislative process we often find Parliament and the Council negotiating hard in the conciliation procedure. However the outcome is generally a balanced result that the European Parliament can accept. But this does not apply in the case of the "takeover directive", which, after many years' work, should now be before us in its final form.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should reject the result which emerged from a night session in Luxembourg. It is worthless. I am saying that to you quite frankly, although I was a member of this House's delegation to the negotiations. However, I can also tell you that we have never been treated so frostily in any of the Conciliation Committees in which I have been involved. There was not a trace of mutual give and take! By an overwhelming majority, the Council's negotiating team largely swept aside the ideas adopted by the European Parliament. I do not want to go through the details already mentioned again point by point. However, I would warn against this House sweeping the decisions it took by a convincing majority under the carpet and accepting an obscure conciliation result. We would lose face and the public would quite rightly ridicule us for our weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the result of the conciliation process that we have before us is so poor that after that night in Luxembourg Commissioner Bolkestein stood before the press and said that legal fine tuning would still be needed. I think that must have been a joke, because there really has been plenty of time for legal fine tuning over all the years. But we should let the Commissioner have his wish! We should reject the text that emerged from the Conciliation Committee and Commissioner Bolkestein can present a workable new draft before long, one which matches not only his ideas but also the ideas of the elected representatives of 370 million Europeans.</p>

What did we achieve in conciliation? Out of 15 amendments tabled in second reading, compromises were reached on 11. In this House we have a duty to deal with the facts, not to listen to the jungle drums beating from misinformed sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the changes in amendments, made by my own political group, to recognise the legitimate interests of employees in a takeover bid. Here the common text has been modified from a requirement to provide new information to a requirement to provide information to employees at three points in the directive: in Article 6(1), Article 6(2) and Article 9(1d). There are minimum standards. There is nothing to prevent boards of companies or Member States going further than the requirements in this directive, nor does it prejudice obligations to inform and consult under either national or EU directives. We can only, in conciliation, go as far as amendments allow us in second reading. No amendments were tabled requiring the board of a company to consult prior to a takeover bid.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that Article 9, and the right of boards to take defensive action without shareholder approval, was the bone of contention in conciliation. But is simply not true to state that the board of a company faced with a hostile takeover cannot take action or is obliged to remain neutral or passive. Defensive and frustrating action is possible with shareholder approval. Indeed, our amendments to the common position mean that a board can get fast-track approval in 14 days.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always believed that politics is the art of the possible. In conciliation the Council and the Commission stuck to their key objective in this directive, of protecting the minority shareholders, protecting the interests of investors and defending shareholders against unscrupulous directors and inefficient company boards.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9 and restrictions on frustrating action was the Holy Grail of this text. Therefore we had no scope to rewrite it to allow unapproved poison pill action. But we did achieve a deal on Article 9: we forced the Commission and the Council to freeze the article and to have a group of company law experts to examine key issues, and to come back to Parliament in March 2002. This also includes – as the Commissioner can confirm – the possibility of reviewing Article 9 in the light of the findings of that group. The entry into force of this directive is therefore postponed and Member States can postpone compliance with Article 9 until 2006.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission is delighted that Parliament and the Council have at last come to an agreement in the Conciliation Committee on the proposal for a directive concerning takeover bids. I should like to thank the Parliament delegation and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and Mr Provan, who chaired the delegation, for their important contributions. Once again we have shown that the institutions are capable of finding an acceptable compromise. This proposal for a directive is important for the European Union, it is important for the Financial Services Action Plan, which has been identified as a priority by the Lisbon European Council. It is equally important for industry, for all sorts of companies, because it will provide a secure legal framework for restructuring operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Some fears have been expressed about the directive. First, some say that it leaves the companies defenceless when faced with a hostile takeover bid. However, I would remind you that the directive allows any company to take any defensive measure deemed necessary provided that the shareholders agree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is claimed that some European companies would be put at a disadvantage compared to American companies, because the managers of American companies can defend themselves without consulting their shareholders. However, I may point out that if they do not take shareholders' interests into account, management decisions may be contested by any shareholder before the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are concerns that there is no level playing field in Europe for the protection of minority shareholders. But this directive provides for a first step towards creating such a level playing field by protecting all shareholders, and in particular minority shareholders, in the case of a change of control in their companies. In particular, it provides for a mandatory offer to all shareholders for all their holdings at an equitable price, and with an obligation of cash consideration in certain conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, some claim there is no protection for the employees of the companies involved, but this directive provides for complete and immediate information for employees and also gives them the opportunity to state their opinion on the offer. And, of course, the companies involved must obey national and European regulations, especially the employment directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, some claim that we shall see a huge number of aggressive takeovers across the Union, but the facts tell us otherwise. Today, only 2% of all notified mergers or acquisitions are hostile. The Commission has undertaken to monitor and ensure that no such distortions emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourteen Member States and the Commission are in favour of this improvement in company law. The Commission will undertake further work on the definition of equitable price, the squeeze-out procedure and the level playing field for protecting shareholders in the Member States, particularly in response to the European Parliament. We shall produce this work by March 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the adoption of this directive will build confidence in the European institutions and in European financial markets. The efforts made jointly by your parliamentary delegation, the Council and the Commission in order to reach the agreement of 6 June make it worth sending a message that, after 12 years of work on this proposal for a directive, there can be a compromise between the co-legislators in this field. This makes it worth encouraging the further development of company law at European level. I trust in the judgment of Parliament and am confident that it will vote in favour of adopting this proposal for a directive.</p>

Commissioner Bolkestein has just joined a long list of his colleagues who have been subjected to a procedure in this Parliament which is no longer acceptable. He was making an important speech to a full House but the only people listening were members of the public and our electorate in the Gallery. I insist that this matter now be referred to the Bureau and that, as of September, we see no further repetition.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are all guilty of talking. We can, of course, all listen to the Commissioner through our headphones. However, if this Parliament is not conscious of the image it portrays to the public, then it should be. So, as of September, however it may be done – perhaps you could let off a siren at ear-piercing levels – the Commissioner should be heard, like any other speaker in this Chamber, in dignity and silence.</p>
