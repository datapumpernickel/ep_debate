<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we have now reached the home straight in a Commission initiative – I would call it a good Commission initiative – designed to achieve harmonisation of legislation on insurance mediation. This is a field which so far had not been harmonised. This gap will now be filled and fortunately, I believe, for the better, because the internal market in insurance is crippled if there are no common rules for the commercial networks. If the insurance companies can act within Union territory without any borders, it is clearly also necessary that those who offer their products should be able to act under common rules, with freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, once and for all in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">That, however, is not all that is needed: we must also harmonise our laws to achieve high standards of consumer protection in an area such as this, where there is a highly significant imbalance between the information held by the vendors of the products and that held by the purchasers. This is one of the objectives in this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament adopted a total of 40 amendments, some admittedly by a tiny majority. In the common position, just over half were accepted either as they stood or at least in spirit. Now, at second reading, Parliament has repeated some of the amendments that were not adopted, although it has done so in terms which I think make their approval by the other institutions likely.</p>
<p class="contents">While on this subject, I should like to reflect a little on the codecision procedure, and this makes me think that, if this procedure is generalised, it cannot and must not lead to proceedings becoming unnecessarily lengthy or, if the co-legislating institutions start from different positions, to each one sticking to its own position without coming to any reasonable agreement. If this agreement can be reached without going into the conciliation phase, so much the better and, if so, that is an objective I believe can be achieved in the processing of this directive, because Parliament has shown how it can play a full part in the legislative process by collaborating with other institutions, without the legislative procedure becoming unnecessarily lengthy because of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure, however, also has its problems, and perhaps the most important of them is the debating system in this Parliament. In contrast to what occurs in other parliaments, here we do not debate proposals in a contradictory fashion. Therefore it seems that any effort one may make to try to convince you that certain amendments are good or bad is a wasted effort. Even so, I cannot help at least trying to put across my reasons for opposing or proposing a vote against certain of the amendments that have been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope it will not be a wasted effort, because a thinker from my country used to say that wasted effort leads to melancholy, and at this time of night I do not want to get melancholic.</p>
<p class="contents">I oppose adoption of Amendments 2 and 14 approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I am opposed more strongly than I can tell you to the content of Amendment 2, for various reasons. First, on technical grounds: the amendment tries to exclude from harmonisation certain possibilities that, if approved, would contradict other points in the directive. Other points, ladies and gentlemen, that were approved in the text and accepted by the Council and Commission as a consequence of this Parliament’s amendments at first reading. How are we going to adopt this amendment if it conflicts with our own texts?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, but no less importantly: if, as Amendment 2 would have it, certain types of intermediary are to be excluded from harmonisation, this means, no less, that a large part of the sale of insurance contracts would fall outside the consumer protection mechanisms contained in the directive, and this should not be accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very pleased with this Council common position document, which reads far better and more intelligibly than the initial Commission proposals. It is internally consistent and incorporates some 20 first reading amendments from Parliament, including several that I submitted, such as the need to cater for the electronic age and Internet age by allowing for computer and disk storage of data, exemptions for telephone selling, exemptions for the travel industry for small contracts and action to ensure that the scope of the directive does not extend to the mere provision of information on products.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully accept compromise Amendment No 15 relating to transitional provisions to exempt existing brokers and also compromise Amendment No 7 for a regular review of registration as opposed to my original proposal for a three-yearly review.</p>
<p class="contents">This was originally carried by the committee in order to ensure the maintenance of high standards of probity and professional standards of the intermediaries, or brokers, as we call them in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly support the Council proposal for information exchange between competent registration authorities and the fact that the role of the insurance undertaking is prescribed in the intermediaries' registration process, particularly for the tied intermediaries category.</p>
<p class="contents">After much deliberation I too will oppose Amendment No 2 as I realise this would pose problems to the Council by considerably reducing the application of the directive. If passed, it would necessarily have to go to conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall support compromise Amendment No 16 to get rid of the best-advice principle, which would impose unacceptable burdens on the industry. I continue to support Amendment No 18, which is designed to reduce the burden on the industry by ensuring that the obligation to provide information applies only when a customer requests it.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, this has the making of a good piece of pioneer legislation which will be an integral part of the financial services action plan and the first designed specifically for insurance brokers. It will serve as a model for other types of brokers in financial products and, not doubt, in other areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This definitive measure will provide a useful service to Europe's consumers in facilitating a safe and competitive pan-European insurance market with mutually recognised and acceptable standards of professional competence by using the financial passport, with only minimal standards being set, rather than prescriptive harmonisation proceedings, as some would have claimed necessary for such an undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur. I look forward to this speedily becoming European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To begin with, I wish to thank Commissioner Bolkestein who has once again presented a well-balanced proposal for completing the internal market, this time within the field of financial services. I also want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for a sound piece of work, from the first reading to today’s second and very rapid reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is gratifying that the Council is, for the most part, adopting Parliament’s position from the first reading. This proposal will make it possible to make cross-border offers of insurance while providing a high degree of consumer protection. There is a good balance between a freer market, benefiting consumers by offering them more choice, better competition and lower prices, and the requirements governing the protection of policyholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this balance between the market and consumer protection has, in the end, been established at the right level and feels reasonable is incredibly important for an increasingly cross-border market. It is basically a question of confidence, which is something we are seeing right now in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulations must be designed in a way that creates confidence in those who constitute the market, that is to say the consumers. As Dr Tannock stated, it is not a question of harmonising all the regulations but, rather, of finding methods of achieving a mutual acceptance of current rules in the various Member States. I believe that is a wise approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party assent to most of the amendments, even though we question the wisdom of adopting a number of them. Allow me to mention the most important amendment which, in important respects, alters the whole proposal. In common with Mr Berenguer Fuster, I am talking about the second amendment, which we cannot accept. It would be unfair to consumers and their demand for security. It would also be in danger of distorting competition. We shall therefore vote against this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the current draft proposal on cross-European insurance mediation ensures a high level of professionalism and competence among insurance intermediaries. Our common aim is to guarantee that all persons, natural and legal, pursing the activity of insurance brokerage are registered by a competent authority on the basis of a minimum set of professional requirements. A single registration system for intermediaries facilitates cross-border activities by way of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. The proposal also guarantees a high level of protection for customers' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately the original Commission proposal did not take sufficient account of the diversity of European insurance markets. It would have imposed an unnecessarily heavy bureaucratic burden on many intermediaries, without increasing customer protection. Our amendments from the first reading referred explicitly to those whose main activity is not to sell insurance but rather to offer the standardised insurance contracts that have been in use in many countries for decades, for instance tourist assistance packages or car insurance offered by travel agencies and car dealers.</p>
<p class="contents">Customer protection is a primary value in the insurance business of my home country and, yes, travel agents and car dealers are entitled to sell standardised products. Trouble-free years of experience have shown that the current practice is in the interests of both intermediaries and customers.</p>
<p class="contents">Costs of insurance mediation must not be increased, especially when there is no benefit to customers. Nor is it useful for certain Member States to adopt more stringent provisions regarding information requirements, which bring no added value to the customer but merely distort competition between European providers. I am happy that my colleagues supported my amendments in the committee vote and I hope they will also support them tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive as it now stands in the second reading is a good draft, providing a reasonable compromise between the legitimate interests of Member States, insurance providers and customers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to enlarge on my speech of 13 November 2001 by discussing the following areas. I would like, first, to thank the rapporteur and the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur for the excellent work they have done. I believe that both the Commission proposal and Parliament's report make a further contribution to a stronger financial internal market, to facilitation of cross-border activity and to greater harmonisation in this area, which is dependent on public trust and of importance to transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments have already been discussed. For my part, I would like to deal with Amendment No 6, which concerns itself with greater transparency, because we want to see to it that the register, in addition to the proposed methods, shall indicate the country or countries in which the intermediary conducts business under the rules on establishment or on the freedom to provide services.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we want to ensure that there are greater possibilities for monitoring, by using Amendment No 10 to allow consumer associations to register complaints. Then Amendment No 12 has to do with sorting out the frequently-discussed question of whether information should be supplied without being requested, by stipulating that information on the customer's rights must be supplied, whilst detailed information may be requested.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that Amendment No 2 should not be misunderstood. It is not opposed to harmonisation. Many countries, though, have stricter rules of various kinds, so that, for example, credit institutions are already subject to many requirements contained in this directive. Amendment No 2 is therefore intended to take account of these different rules, which already impose higher standards, by making different approaches to it possible, without, though, undermining the directive's basic tendency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their judicious and efficient handling of this matter. After the second reading in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, only 18 amendments were submitted to plenary. This is evidence of the balanced quality of the common position text which Mr Berenguer Fuster mentioned to the committee last week. It was not just a compliment. Indeed, the common position to a large extent follows the line taken by Parliament at first reading. It took account of the most important amendments adopted, which improved our initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan for financial services identified insurance intermediaries as a priority objective. Insurance intermediaries are indeed confronted with obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty. This hinders the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive following the text of the common position will ensure that, once registered in his home Member State, which is responsible for checking professional and financial requirements, an insurance intermediary will be able to conduct his activities throughout the internal market. That will improve the functioning of that internal market in insurance, particularly as regards retail markets. At the same time, the directive will guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position now submitted to this Parliament is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission's proposal. The Commission supports this text. But it is vital to ensure that the difficult balance reached in the common position is not put in jeopardy by amendments which would not be compatible with its fundamental objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the amendments which were submitted to plenary. The Commission can accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16. With regard to Amendment No 17, which aims to clarify the scope of the directive, the Commission can accept it, even though it considers that minor redrafting is needed in order to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 2, 9, 13, 14 and 18, for the following reasons: firstly, Amendment No 2, on which Mr Berenguer Fuster, Mr Tannock and Mr Schmidt have spoken just now. That amendment aims to exclude from the scope of the proposal a large number of insurance intermediaries, such as car dealers selling motor insurance, travel agencies, veterinary surgeons, captive intermediaries of industrial firms and some bank insurance activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Such exclusions would affect the sale of a large number of insurance products involving important risks. They would deprive the directive of a major part of its content. Furthermore these excluded intermediaries would not be able to make use of the advantages provided for in the directive. Should these intermediaries be excluded from the benefits of the internal market, I very much share Mr Berenguer Fuster's concern about that amendment. The Commission cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 introduces a transitional provision aiming to facilitate the application of the directive to those intermediaries already carrying out activities before the date of adoption of the proposal by the Commission, namely September 2000. The Commission already welcomed this idea at first reading, but, as Amendment No 15 better meets the concerns of the directive, the Commission would prefer it to be adopted rather than Amendment No 9.</p>
<p class="contents">While a fundamental element of the proposal and the common position is to ensure a high level of consumer protection by providing customers with appropriate information and advice, Amendment No 13 would devalue that requirement. It provides that the advice given by an intermediary has to be based on the best possible advice principle. The Commission cannot accept that amendment. It would imply enormous difficulties for the work of any insurance intermediary. It would also lead to great legal uncertainty and may be a source of legal conflict. Last, but not least, it would increase the costs of insurance mediation. The text of the common position already contains a balanced provision which makes it mandatory to provide appropriate advice on the basis of a fair analysis of the insurance contracts available on the market. That provision fully ensures a high level of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 16, which refers to an objective analysis, is along the same lines as the common position and may improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">The last amendment that I wish to discuss is Amendment No 14, which provides, in the case of immediate cover, for a derogation to the principle that the information requested by the directive must be given in writing. That would jeopardise the objective of a high level of consumer protection. The common position already takes account of the spirit of Amendment No 44 proposed at first reading. Accepting this new amendment would deprive the consumer of written confirmation of the information required by the directive. The same reasoning also applies to Amendment No 18, which reduces the obligation on insurance intermediaries to specify the demands of the customer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
