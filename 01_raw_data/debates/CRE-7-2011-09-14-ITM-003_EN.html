<p class="contents">As you know, during the summer recess the European Parliament was already making efforts to ensure that straight after the recess we could immediately begin discussion of matters relating to the crisis and do everything possible to support the work of the Commission and work with the Council on solving the economic problems of our continent. The Committee on Economic and Budgetary Affairs met on 29 August. Now we are continuing our debate in the European Parliament. At a future part-session the Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Euro Group Jean-Claude Juncker is also going to discuss the subject of economic matters in Europe. We are, therefore, attending to our most important internal question. Taking part in today’s proceedings are a representative of the Polish Presidency, Mr Rostowski, and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. I would like to welcome them both. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jan Vincent-Rostowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, 219 years ago, on 11 July 1792 in Paris, the Legislative Assembly issued a declaration which began with the words <span class="italic">la patrie est en danger</span> – ‘the nation is under threat’. I think that we are in no doubt, today, we cannot be in any doubt, and I will say this in French: <span class="italic">que l’Europe est en danger</span> – ‘Europe is under threat’. Only two months later, a brief skirmish took place at Valmy and the French Republic was saved. That was in September 1792. We are still a long way from victory, and I would like, today, to outline the dangers facing Europe, us, Parliament and the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think we must clearly and unambiguously say that if it were not for the vital interventions of the European Central Bank in August this year, which were fully justified from the technical, legal and political point of view – I will come back to these three in a moment – we would not, today, be looking with alarm at an approaching hurricane, we would already be in the middle of it. I am in no doubt that in those highly charged days the European Central Bank, and in particular its President Jean-Claude Trichet, saved Europe. The technical justification for the interventions which were begun then and which continue today is fairly obvious, and at the same time also constitutes their legal justification.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of uncertainty and the level of fear which exist in the markets as a result of apprehension over the enormous upheavals which might very naturally engulf Europe are making the normal operation of monetary policy impossible. How can the Central Bank influence and ensure price stability if the normal transmission channel – adjustment of interest rates and the Central Bank’s money supply – does not affect what is done by European families or European businesses, or obviously at the most important and fundamental level if it does not affect the behaviour of European commercial banks? All these participants in Europe’s economic life are conscious of the dangers, and this being the case they do not know if they should hold on to their money, which makes the normal function of transmission mechanisms impossible, or get rid of their money, which could result in the danger of inflation. In this situation of uncertainty the first duty of the Central Bank must be to protect transmission mechanisms and secure stability. For this we must not only be grateful to the European Central Bank, but we must also firmly and clearly back its decisions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also worth thinking about what would happen if we were to allow a gradual disintegration of the euro area – if some countries, the poorer and weaker ones, were pushed out of the euro area, or if other, wealthier countries themselves decided to leave the euro area. I am sure the Members of this House are familiar with the analysis conducted recently and published by the Swiss bank UBS. According to these calculations, if a poor country, a country which is in trouble, were to leave the euro area or be pushed out of the euro area, the costs for that country could reach 40-50% of its GDP in the first year and then be from between 10% to 20% of GDP annually. If a rich country decided to leave the euro area, the costs in the first year would be 20-25% of GDP, and after that GDP would be permanently at a level 10% lower than it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">Those figures may seem abstract. Let us think more carefully about what would happen to unemployment in the wealthier countries, in a country such as Germany, or if the budget of a large member of the euro area ran out of money or if such a country were to leave the euro area. Of course, we do not know exactly what the consequences would be, but it seems to me that a level of unemployment significantly higher than 15% is the least we could fear in such a situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we can also be of the opinion that a continuation of the crisis as it is, in its current unspecified and unfinished form, will also unavoidably cause – if it were to continue as it is, and of course it is doubtful if a situation in which the crisis remains unresolved is possible – but if this situation were to continue for a year or two, we would have to reckon with a very, very significant rise in unemployment, perhaps even a doubling of current levels, and this would also happen in the wealthiest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, Poland, as the country holding the Presidency and as a Member State, fully supports all efforts to overcome the crisis by further integration of the euro area. However, we must remember that this process should not be used to create a two-speed Europe. We must, of course, save Europe at all costs, but we ought – working together as the 17 – to do only that which is necessary to save the euro area and so to save Europe, because, and let us not fool ourselves, if the euro area were to collapse, Europe would not last long after such a shock and all of its dramatic political consequences. This is why in closing I would like to appeal for rapid agreement on the six-pack. The differences between Parliament and the Council are now truly minimal. We must send a clear signal that we can work together by taking the six-pack quickly through to completion.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a personal anecdote. At the airport last week, I met a friend who worked with me in the Ministry of Finance during the first years of Poland’s transformation. Today, he is the President of a large Polish bank. We were talking about the crisis in the euro area, and he said, ‘You know, economic and political upheavals like this are usually followed 10 years later by a catastrophic descent into war. I am seriously thinking about getting a green card for my children in the United States.’ Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, we must not allow this to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are confronted with the most serious challenge of a generation. This is a fight for the jobs and prosperity of families in all our Member States. This is a fight for the economic and political future of Europe. This is a fight for what Europe represents in the world. This is a fight for European integration itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge the reality. Our citizens, the markets and our partners in the world have not yet been convinced that we are capable of taking on that fight and winning it decisively. In the cacophony of criticisms, counter-criticisms, magic bullets and miracle panaceas that are proposed on a daily basis the truth has been drowned out – that solid, visible, concrete proposals have been made. They have been agreed upon but they have taken too long and have not yet been fully delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">So my first concern is implementation of what we agreed. That is why it is now imperative that we demonstrate our joint resolve to act upon our decisions without delay. Now is the time to prove our full commitment to the principles of solidarity and responsibility. All euro area Member States have made commitments and are making efforts to put in order their public finances and to implement economic reforms that are indeed a precondition for growth. All of these Member States must now demonstrate in a convincing way that they are serious. It is not enough to make plans. It is action that counts and those euro area Member States that are providing the assistance so crucial for the survival and stability of the euro must also clearly show that they are determined to deliver support to countries that implement their programmes, as they have agreed. They must acknowledge that this is also to their advantage. Supporting the euro is not just an act of solidarity towards others. It is an act of self-interest.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is easy and we in the European institutions must recognise that. We must make the case and persuade our citizens why they should give their support. National politicians need to do much more to explain the benefits that the euro brings and we in the European institutions have a special role to play. We must do more together to make the case and I count on you to do so in your countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Reassurance for our citizens, for investors and for our world partners can only come from the conviction that a comprehensive approach is being delivered in the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is needed now in the short term? First of all, the implementation of the package agreed on 21 July 2011 by all euro area Heads of State and Government, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Central Bank in the presence of the IMF. It is an important package which includes measures to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF that will help to ensure financial stability. It foresees lowering lending rates, extending the maturities and allowing the Facility to do more than intervene only in a precautionary way, by allowing it to intervene on the secondary markets. These decisions are important but they have not yet been implemented. The obstacles raised by some in implementing the crucial decisions already in the days and weeks following the meeting exacerbated the extraordinary developments in the sovereign bond markets during August. Of course, the fact there were also difficult moments on the other side of the Atlantic, creating doubts regarding the situation of the United States of America, was also a major factor aggravating the general very negative investor sentiment. This also reflected an unabated concern among investors that the euro area is incapable of responding effectively to its own crisis, because it takes too long to enact its own decisions. We have to recognise that sometimes there is a real problem between the speed of the markets and the time we take to make democratic decisions. Markets are impatient and democracies are usually slower.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission worked tirelessly through the summer to support the work necessary to implement the decisions. Both Commissioner Rehn and I came to Brussels to drive this work forward. Therefore I expect all euro area Member States to make good on their promises and urge them to ratify the 21 July agreement by the end of September. Last weekend, the Greek Government took significant steps to deliver on their commitments. I urge Greece to finalise these efforts together with the Troika. The perspective of recovery and growth should be made a national cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Another urgent priority is the six-pack on reinforced economic governance. I talked about the delivery gap. It is now almost one year since the Commission put forward ambitious proposals to strengthen governance of euro area economies. After all the talk, we are now very close to what the Commission originally put on the table. The European Parliament has played a decisive role in keeping the level of ambition of these proposals. I salute you for that. I would now ask the co-legislators to adopt this package as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the leadership we must provide means being honest with our citizens that we are also addressing the structural problems Europe faces. The crisis that we are facing is the result of competitiveness problems. Within the European Union – and also within the euro area – some Member States have been lagging behind others, which has led to greater imbalances. The same types of imbalances have also built up worldwide. This has resulted in an accumulation of debts and deficits that are simply not sustainable and have been further aggravated by the financial crisis. To tackle the crisis, we must correct the excessive deficits and debts in a determined and sustainable way. This is the only way to create a Union of stability and growth and it can only be done convincingly through the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a duty to learn the lessons of the crisis and to focus on the creation of growth and jobs. At the top of the agenda is the need to build a strong economy and not to use fiscal or monetary stimulus to live beyond our means. We must look at the reforms needed to correct these imbalances so as to create growth and jobs for the future. Growth is key. We must use all instruments available to promote growth. In the European Union we have some instruments, from the Agenda 2020 to the Single Market Act, to promote sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to reform to deliver the good jobs, the better healthcare and the comfortable retirement that all Europeans aspire to. The purpose of reform is to strengthen our social market economy; to deliver a fair society where everyone has a chance in life and nobody is left behind; and to equip all Europeans with the skills, talents and opportunities to prosper in the global economy. Our impulse for reform must go hand-in-hand with our sense of fairness and social equity.</p>
<p class="contents">A sound economy also means we need sound financial markets. They have to return to their original function of a service industry for the real economy. The development of their profits must reflect the real economy. We have presented a whole series of proposals to this end, including those on short-selling and over-the-counter derivatives. In the next weeks we will go further with proposals to tackle insider trading and market manipulation, among others, as well as measures to address concerns over credit rating agencies. As I promised, the European Commission will also very soon propose a Financial Transaction Tax.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the governance of the euro area, I am convinced we need deeper and more results-driven integration, and let me be clear: this has to be within the Community system. A system based purely on intergovernmental cooperation has not worked in the past and will not work in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">After all, this is why the Community method and the EU institutions were created by the Member States in the first place. The Economic and Monetary Union cannot function properly only on the basis of decisions taken by unanimity, because if a Eurosceptic fringe can determine the position of one Member State and if one Member State can block decisions, the result is that we are not credible. This is not about institutional positioning or power. It is about efficiency and delivery. Market investors will trust us only when we can show that we are able to deliver on our commitments and in a real determined way.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the independent work of the European institutions further strengthens the credibility of our economic and budgetary policies. It is only through the European institutions that the European interest of all euro area Member States will be counted. It is only through the European institutions that we will avoid a fragmentation of the Single Market and a disconnect between the 17 members of the euro area and the European project of the 27 countries that are the European Union. We must keep the euro united and we must keep the euro open.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to ensure democratic legitimacy for decisions taken at European level, full unequivocal respect for the role of this House is crucial. If we want European citizens to take ownership of European integration, re-nationalising euro area decisions is not the way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the European Commission and the European Parliament, are the Community institutions <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. And it is our duty to defend the collective European interest jointly. We must show that the Community actors are strong, united and able to deliver. Delivering also means that we need a better spirit of partnership and confidence between us – the European institutions – and the Member States, their governments and national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the signal I receive time and time again from our global partners, including in the G20, is that the world expects a more integrated Europe. In the age of globalisation everybody expects Europe to be stronger and united. We are a valued partner in global fora and debates and we have a significant influence on global issues such as trade and climate change because in those matters we are able to act together, united.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact is that our way of taking and implementing decisions in the Economic and Monetary Union is consigning us to punching below our weight. Only by acting together and maximising the benefits of our interdependence will Europe reach its true potential and be able to act as more than the sum of its parts. The conclusion I draw is crystal clear: the right way to stop the negative cycle and to strengthen the euro is to deepen integration, namely within the euro area, based on the Community method. This is the way to go.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is also the way for the euro area to really play the role that investors and global partners expect it to play. What we need now is a new, unifying impulse: <span class="italic">un nouveau moment fédérateur</span> – let us not be afraid of the word – <span class="italic">un moment fédérateur</span> is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the road to recovery is long and it is painful for millions of our citizens and businesses, but it will not be made less painful by continued procrastination or by presenting as quick fixes ideas that will necessarily take time. It has become clear that we need an even greater integration of our economic and budgetary policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much debate on the need for eurobonds. Today I want to confirm that the Commission will soon present options for the introduction of eurobonds. Some of these options could be implemented within the terms of the current Treaty, others would require Treaty change. But we must be honest: this will not bring an immediate solution for all the problems we face, and it will be one element of a comprehensive approach to further economic and political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not confuse these projects for deeper integration with immediate necessities. Ideas that would require substantial Treaty change are not going to be a substitute for Greece doing its homework or for euro area countries strengthening their fiscal surveillance. We must avoid compounding the dissatisfaction in public opinion by being seen as failing to deliver overnight what we already know takes time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need now is for Greece to fully carry out its reform programme; for the six-pack to be adopted; and for Member States to ratify the 21 July agreements. What would be our credibility on deeper integration if we could not deliver the six-pack or the 21 July agreement? Only by proving ourselves in this way can we regain the market and public confidence necessary to even aspire to longer-term goals, to a more ambitious euro area and to a stronger Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to play its role to the full, putting the key proposals on the table that shape both the immediate and the long-term response: proposals that are ambitious, that should reflect the interests of all. What both the citizens and the investors want is political determination and economic discipline. To deliver this, we need more, not less, Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Deeper integration is part of the solution. It will happen – not overnight – but in a solid, democratic process with the participation of this Parliament. I believe that with courage and wisdom the European Union will – as was always the case in the past – come out of the crisis stronger. It is certainly our duty to work for that purpose.</p>

<p class="contents">I am referring here to the first public finance consolidation measures and to the positive golden rule proposal. I am also referring to the introduction of measures to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility and the establishment of new economic governance instruments, or the six-pack, on which I should like to see a definitive agreement reached before the end of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also referring to the coordination of national budgets and to this summer’s proposals regarding European economic governance, the financial transactions tax and tax harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker broke off due to an interpreting problem)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since the start of the crisis, billions of euros have been committed. European citizens are indeed concerned, as they can see no end to the efforts being asked of them. They feel as if they are feeding a bottomless pit, even though they are aware that this European crisis calls for a Europe-wide response and not only a national one. They question the ability of national and European leaders to end this crisis of confidence and growth once and for all. The markets remain unsatisfied, doubtful and particularly volatile, and react to the slightest rumour.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come, for eurozone Member States and for any other EU Member States that would like to be involved, to pull out all the stops and adopt strong measures, together and at the same time, to put an end to the doubts over the EU’s capacity to shoulder its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, President-in-Office of the Council, Europe must restore its credibility. Europe must face up to reality and regain control of public finances. It must prepare itself for a transitional period characterised by stringent financial management at both national and regional level, and by incentives for savers and for investment in innovation, education and training. Europe must undergo a dramatic transformation to be referred to as the federation of the United States of Europe, or simply integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In this crisis, as in any other crisis, nothing will ever be as it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: are we capable, right now, of envisaging a different future for ourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that, on the basis of a Commission proposal, all eurozone governments and all other EU governments who so wish, take a decision to drastically reduce their debts by taking coordinated measures, all at once and on the same day, to ensure the viability of their pension systems and to actually harmonise their taxation, in particular their corporate taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">By suddenly making economic governance a reality, and one that is accepted by all the Member States of the euro area, the EU would achieve two things: it would demonstrate its capacity to take long-term action, and it would strengthen cohesion between citizens, who would at last be subject to the same rights and obligations. By taking coordinated budgetary discipline measures while stimulating crucial growth in our economies, countries would establish a single or converging set of rules and would send a clear and strong message as to their will to further integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word, President Barroso, about growth. We are constantly saying ‘growth, growth’. Many people still dream of achieving double-digit growth. Our primary duty is to sustain low growth and avoid deflation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions, for their part, must be more ambitious as regards common policies. We need those policies that we refer to regularly: a trade policy, an ambitious research policy, a food-safety policy, an industrial policy that has finally undergone reform, and above all a policy enabling the internal market to function properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many regulations, but in these difficult times it remains to be seen whether they are actually applied. If there are things which need revising, we will revise them, but there is no need to add to them in the current climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also enhance integration of the euro area, the heart of European integration, in order to help reform the European Union. That is what we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for, as we are aware of the responsibility of the centre-right, which is in the driving seat in times of trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our credibility is going to be at stake over the coming months. It is true that we are under very heavy attack, which is probably exaggerated in some areas. It is now up to us to show that the EU has the capacity to restore growth conditions and avoid succumbing to deflation. This, too, will safeguard employment levels. Everything must be done to protect our way of life as much as possible and to defend our values.</p>
<p class="contents">A major integration effort is ultimately not the way to succeed. Instead, ladies and gentlemen, we must find a way, among responsible democratic political groups, of showing a new approach and a new path to our Heads of State or Government, who are in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am asking of this Parliament, and of President Barroso and the President-in-Office of the Council, over the coming weeks, is unity, that is to say a single vision for European citizens for the four or five years to come. That is what we must work towards today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a serious crisis which is threatening the process of European integration. We need to be completely clear about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State or Government of the eurozone countries agreed on 21 July to take measures which we all believed would demonstrate that the eurozone cannot be split up and would also show that we are taking bold, joint action, which is coming late, but hopefully not too late. Subsequently, these same heads of government in many of the eurozone countries had to fight for the political survival of their governments, among other things because of the measures that they had taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem not only concerns the weakness of the euro. Most importantly, it concerns the weakness of those people who are supposed to be managing the euro. Consequently, much of what you say, Mr Barroso, is right, but in the case of those responsible for managing the euro it appears to be falling on deaf ears. They seem to me to be like Buridan’s ass. It also stood between two piles of hay and could not decide which one it should eat from. It ended up starving to death.</p>
<p class="contents">The president of the German Bundesbank, Mr Weidmann, has rightly said that we have reached the time of either-or. Either everyone must act for themselves and against all the others or everyone must work together and take joint action to support our strong currency. The middle way, which most countries always seem to choose and which involves a partial commitment and a yes-and-no, wait-and-see approach, will bring the euro to the point of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need committed, joint action involving the European Union institutions. We need economic governance for the European Union which will ensure that all our policies are coherent. By this I mean all the policies both inside and outside the eurozone. You are right that the euro is open to everyone. The stability criteria apply not only to the eurozone countries but also to those outside. The institution which will ensure that all the policies across the EU are coherent is not Herman Van Rompuy, but the European Commission, monitored by and linked to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This should mean the end of the debate on the institutions, because we cannot afford to continue it now that we are in a situation where the social structure of Europe is under serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in favour of the golden rule. We are in favour of budgetary discipline, because there is absolutely no alternative to this. However, it must be fair. At a time when salaries and pensions are being cut and sales taxes are being increased, I read in the newspaper that the bonuses of bankers in all the Member States within the eurozone have returned to their 2008 levels. That is not fair. This is why I believe that the rich must contribute more than the poor. We will not be able to impose budgetary discipline throughout Europe if everyone has the feeling that the ordinary people always have to pay and take the risks and that those who are really wealthy can shirk their responsibilities by sending their money to the remaining tax havens, for example. This is part of the economic governance ‘six-pack’ which also needs to be regulated.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The calls from the United States, Japan and China, our global economic competitors, to the European Union for more unity and more budgetary discipline are not acts of charity and sympathy by the Americans and the Chinese on our behalf. They are a way of expressing the fear that the collapse of the eurozone would drag the world economy into the abyss. This is why those people who want to make state bankruptcies into a self-fulfilling prophecy, because their own party is bankrupt, are playing with fire which we may well not be able to put out. For this reason, I am firmly convinced that if we act jointly and continue along the path of stabilising the eurozone that we have already taken, and if the heads of government who have made that decision are supported within their own countries and by their coalition parties, we have a chance of stabilising the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe want transparent policies and they want to know where their fate is being discussed. At a European level, the Council of Heads of State or Government is debating the fate of 500 million people behind closed doors. This Parliament is the institution which must make public the debate about the fate of the people of Europe. If we have economic governance, then this House is the economic parliament. That is the job that we have to do here. I am not afraid of entering into a new battle. Please tell your friend, Mr Vincent-Rostowski, that Europe is strong enough. If the pro-Europeans stand together, we have a good chance of coming out of this crisis in a stronger position.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I think everybody here agrees that this is a very deep crisis, but we should not make the mistake at the beginning of this debate of saying that this is a Greek debt crisis. The Greek debt crisis is maybe the trigger, but what is really at stake is a deep crisis in the eurozone. First of all, we need to make an analysis of why we are in this crisis today, what went wrong. I think the reason is simple: first of all, we made a strategic mistake at the beginning when we launched the euro. We launched a monetary union, but we did not launch an economic and fiscal union, and we know that it is impossible to have one single currency with 17 different governments, 17 different bond markets, 17 different economic strategies. That does not exist anywhere in the world. Why should it exist then in Europe alone?</p>
<p class="contents">I think we also made a mistake of method. What we have used over the last 10 years in Europe is a bad method, a weak method, an intergovernmental method, and markets simply do not believe that Member States can produce enough discipline and enough solidarity to keep together a single currency. That is what we in fact need. That is what markets are asking for. For the first time, we have markets which are not asking for more deregulation; no, they are they asking for more unity in Europe, for a transfer of power to the European level. That is the request of the financial markets of today.</p>
<p class="contents">To complete the analysis, I think that we have also had a bad attitude over the last 18 months, since the start of the crisis. We have seen political leadership in Europe in the Member States with a stop-and-go policy, a cacophony, half-measures and a lack of global approach. That global approach is what we need now, and what we need to hear from the European Commission. What is the global approach that can stop the crisis and then recreate confidence in the markets? What do we need? I think we need four building blocks, and it is for the Commission to come forward with these four building blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a real economic governance and economic government. Excuse me, but the proposals of Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy a few weeks ago are not doing the job. A government of Heads of State and Government seeing each other twice a year is not a government. In my opinion, governments should see each other twice a week and not twice a year, as in the Merkel/Sarkozy proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second building block is also very clear. We need a eurobond market, because the ECB cannot forever continue to buy bonds off countries in difficulties. That is not possible, so we need a eurobond market. What is the situation today in Europe? The real situation in Europe is that the bond market in Europe is completely blocked. There are today no banks, insurance companies, pension funds or institutional investors who are still willing to buy bonds from a number of European countries and we are now dependent on savings from Latin America and China to have enough liquidity in Europe for the bonds of a number of European countries. That is the situation. So you have the choice. And in Germany you have the choice – and the FDP has the choice, I shall be very blunt about this – either you continue with the situation where we are dependent on savings from outside Europe or we create a European bond market now. And it is urgent to do it now and not to wait until the end of the year, as some are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">My third proposal, the third building block, is a growth and job act in Europe. We need growth. Let us do what the US Government has done and announce a growth and job pact in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President of the Council, we need the stability pact, the 'six-pack'. Let us be honest: yesterday we received a new proposal from your side and we are going backwards instead of forwards. I thought we had an agreement for real automaticity also in the preventive arm of the Stability Pact: that it is no longer the Member States who have the lead, but it is the Commission who has the lead. In the new proposal, last proposal I have seen, it is again the opposite. I say there is no deal if the Member States do not understand that it is the Commission which has to be in the lead of the Stability Pact and no longer the Member States, as this no longer works in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My final message is clear: we want the Commission to put a global proposal and a global approach on the table of Parliament and the Council. I can tell you, Mr Barroso: do that! It is the only way to put confidence back in the markets. That will be a huge global initiative by the Commission, backed by the European Parliament, and if you do that you can count on this European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a question which I wanted to put to Mr Daul at the very beginning, but I did not manage to get to the Bureau. Mr Daul and Mr Verhofstadt have repeatedly spoken of the necessity of harmonising corporate taxation. I would like to ask if they have in mind specifically the harmonisation of corporate tax rates in the European Union. I would also like to ask if they do not think that such harmonisation of corporate tax rates means increasing the amount of tax paid by businesses in some countries of the European Union which today are developing faster, amongst other reasons because of their tax competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question which we need to ask ourselves when we say that the European Union is currently on the brink of disaster is why all the strong calls from Parliament for a commitment to more Europe and not to less have so far not produced any results. I am largely in agreement with your analyses, Mr Verhofstadt. However, I would like to contradict you on one point. I do not believe that the markets are calling for regulation. Instead, I believe that the markets have so far been exploiting every weak point in our policy in order to continue speculating against the euro and against individual states. Strong calls from our bank do not do any good in this respect when the European Commission and the Council ultimately fail to take a consistent approach to regulating the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our ‘six-pack’ of legislation is all very well, but we already know that ultimately we will say yet again that it is a move in the right direction, but that it does not go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this summer the Polish Presidency rightly said that Mr Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, had saved the European Union – not the euro, but the European Union. What that means, and I believe that it is an accurate description, has not yet been explained. However, I cannot currently tell you how we get to the point after 18 months or two years of debate of sending a signal to the financial markets that none of the Member States of the European Union will be sacrificed and that the unity we are always talking about is real. I can only come up with empty phrases, because I no longer believe in our ability to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I would now like to address my remarks to you. Your speech and your analysis at the end of the turbulent events of recent months has not indicated to me that you are the right person, together with the Commission, to show us the way out of intergovernmentalism and out of the club of rich countries which is currently governing the eurozone and towards a greater sense of community. I am sorry, but I really do have to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must be just as critical of ourselves as stakeholders in the European Union as we are of the Member States. The citizens of the European Union want the European Union. However, if we are no longer in a position to explain what we have agreed, how we will implement the measures we have agreed on, what has changed in Greece and what has been achieved in Germany, if we cannot explain that, Mr Barroso, then the prospects for what is actually needed seem very poor.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and this has been mentioned here in the context of the expectations of China, the United States and other countries, we still represent one of the best and most successful areas in the world. We have so far not been able to find a responsible way out of the crisis. Mr Schulz has my full support for the statement that this is making everything worse, that injustice is growing and that we are increasing the burden on ordinary people during this crisis, while the rich continue to get richer. We have a lot of issues to deal with. There are enough formulas available for economic governance. We now need to implement it and explain it in a credible way, so that the citizens of Europe are prepared to follow us. That is the most important task facing us in the European Union.</p>

That is what we have done with the euro. From the outset, the euro has been a political project ignoring economic realities. Whenever a problem arose, we kicked the can. But now realities are flying in our face. We are pushing Greece into a hole from which it will never emerge without devaluation. Iceland took austerity measures, but it also devalued its currency by 40%. Now its economy is growing again. Greece will have to do the same. Its default is a matter of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Some want to leap into a European transfer union, with Eurobonds. I understand the worries in Germany. Germans will have to pay, but what if Germany gets into trouble itself? Who saves the saviours, as Federal President Wulff rightly asked. The liberal FDP is right to oppose Eurobonds. Unfortunately, they keep silent in this Parliament, and are absent. Instead, I hear their Group leader demanding Eurobonds. I support the Bavarian CSU opposing a United States of Europe, but unfortunately here the CSU is sitting like a pudding. Apparently these parties have two views: one in Berlin and one in Strasbourg. Unsurprisingly, voters get confused. In Berlin they are right: a European transfer union will not save the eurozone, but break it up.</p>

State aid is still being given to the banks and austerity measures are hitting the poorest people and the middle class hardest, particularly in the debt crisis countries, but also in Germany. This weakens overall economic demand, investment and social cohesion within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite many announcements, we have not succeeded in putting in place comprehensive regulations governing the financial markets. The citizens of Europe and the markets themselves obviously have doubts about the economic competence and the ability to act of those in power and of the EU institutions. I must make it clear right from the beginning that none of this pleases me.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who proposed that the EU constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon, should be revised. Before the treaty came into force, my group had already pointed out that it does not meet the current social, democratic and economic requirements and challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to make a brief remark about the EU budget for 2012 and the medium-term financial plan, which we will soon be discussing. The more cuts we make, the less funding will be available for cohesion and structural policy, for supporting cultural institutions and for exchange programmes in the fields of education and research. However, it is precisely these policies which represent the added value offered by the EU, which allow the citizens of Europe to experience the EU at first hand and which represent the first moves towards a social union. In my opinion, anyone who calls this into question is putting the idea of the European Union at risk.</p>

I saw for the first time even your own supporters shaking their heads. They do not believe in what you are saying. The European people do not believe in what you are saying, and I do not really think even you now believe in what you are saying. Because we all know that Greece is going to default. The end game for Greece is near. And you cannot say you were not warned. You were told the Treaties were fatally flawed. You were all told that Greece should never have joined the euro. And when I stood up here five years ago and talked about Greek bond spreads you treated me with such utter derision, it was as if I had been led out of the local lunatic asylum. No, you have been warned all the way through.</p>
<p class="contents">So now what you have got is economic governance, and everybody here in this front row supports more European economic governance. What is European economic governance? I will tell you what it is: it is a plane landing in Athens airport out of which get an official from the Commission, an official from the European Central Bank and an official from the appalling IMF, and those three people – the troika you call them – go in, they meet the Greek Government and they tell the Greek Government what they may or may not do. You have killed democracy in Greece. You have three part-time overseas dictators that now tell the Greek people what they can and cannot do. It is totally unacceptable. Is it any wonder that Greek people are now burning EU flags and drawing swastikas across them? Frankly, unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and political prison you may well spark a revolution in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose there is some good news at least, and that is that in Germany people are waking up; right up to the President people are saying all of this represents the death of democracy. None of this can work, and the German people will simply refuse in the end to pay the bill. Your one achievement is that you have split Europe between north and south. The Greeks now badmouth the Germans; the Germans badmouth the Greeks. I have one last plea, Mr Barroso: will you please help Greece? Help it to get its currency back. Help it to reschedule its debts. Help it out of the mess that you have put it into. Your policies have failed. Stand up, be a man, admit it.</p>

Mr Barroso is still living in another world, but he, too, knows in his heart that Greece is already beyond rescue, that all the support given to Greece has evaporated and that the citizens of Europe have been deceived here.</p>
<p class="contents">It all started way back when Greece joined the EEC. The deception took place then, and we knew it. The MEPs in this Chamber here knew that, as Mr De Gucht, a commissioner at the time, has himself admitted. The agreements underlying the Stability Pact have not been honoured and the people are constantly being fed lies about the aid measures. Because they will not be seeing that money ever again. Mr Verhofstadt, you are right: this single currency cannot work. However, if you ask yourself how we ended up in this situation, just take a good look at yourself. Your party was actually in power when this euro thing was introduced and when this single currency, that was never going to work, came into being. You, yourselves, must bear a share of the responsibility. Your parties are responsible, so you can stop going round pointing the finger at other people. You, yourself, are at fault.</p>

<p class="contents">It did not have to be this way. My Group published a paper a year ago setting out an alternative economic agenda entitled ‘A fair way out of the crisis’.</p>
<p class="contents">We called for a growth and jobs pact. There has been no focus at all on growth or employment in the last year. In America, President Obama is launching a USD 450 billion American jobs act and Europe remains silent on the jobs crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We called for fiscal consolidation, but at a sensible pace – all Member States’ deficits below 3% by 2015, not 2013. The Commission’s latest forecasts, expected tomorrow, will show that many Member States cannot possibly make the 2013 deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed a European Stability Agency to manage a system of eurobonds. I am glad to hear what you have said today, President Barroso, on eurobonds, but I hope it is not a case of too little and too late.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed a financial transactions tax (FTT) as part of a broader budget revenue package. Things have moved on this front but an FTT of 0.01% in 2018 will again be too little too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we made a number of proposals to tackle the root causes of the crisis on, for example, financial regulation and addressing macroeconomic imbalances. On the first, the Commission does not even support a ban on naked short selling, and on the second the Council opposes a symmetrical approach between deficit and excess countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest economic data and developments point in the direction of these proposals and these policies. It is not just about European economic governance. It is about the content of the policies. It is absolutely critical that we find a proper balance between consolidation and urgent support for growth and investment. I will resend you a copy of this paper, President Barroso. I hope this time you will read it and act on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is useful to take stock of the situation after the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing should be said from the outset: as Mr Schulz mentioned, the decisions taken this summer seemingly tend towards a eurozone government without democratic legitimacy. That is not a mere detail, and we can discuss it again later.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word on the six-pack, for which I am one of the rapporteurs. We are told that we must face up to our responsibilities. Very well. Only, what are our responsibilities? Is it our responsibility to agree to a compromise which is not bad but which contains some real flaws, or is it instead to continue to argue that it is not enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I will have a real problem squaring it with my conscience if we continue to condone – as Mr Verhofstadt said – the attitude of governments who want to control how the rules are implemented. When a rule is adopted, it must be implemented under the responsibility of the Commission. That is why we welcomed the six-pack and the reversed qualified majority system that you were proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word to Mr Rostowski, who seems fond of French history. When I see the Council’s proposals, I do not think of 1792. I think of what Mr Talleyrand said about migrants in 1820: ‘They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.’ Clearly, some people have learned nothing from the crisis and forgotten nothing of the nonsensical Fouchet Plan of the 1960s. They still believe that governmental cooperation is the way to convince third parties and the markets that Europe exists. That is not how we view things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is no trouble to you, would you mind listening to it?</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to make a long speech. My question is a specific one: do you know how much Greek money – according to the Greek Government itself – is deposited in Switzerland and escaping Greek taxation? EUR 200 billion, which is the equivalent of Greece’s annual GDP and of two-thirds of Greece’s debt.</p>
<p class="contents">I am still waiting for your initiative to impose taxation on this money which has escaped the Greek tax system. I am also waiting for a strong initiative on this matter from Greece’s socialist government. It would have no macroeconomic impact on Greece, since this money has already gone elsewhere, but this policy would be completely legitimate from a social point of view. However, in order to take this initiative, the Greek Government needs the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">You will argue that this is complicated, but there is a very simple example: the United States, which is fighting a daily battle to have Swiss banking secrecy lifted for its own citizens and which is winning that battle. Meanwhile, we are either doing nothing, or doing things in an utterly disorganised and counterproductive manner, as the UK and Germany have just done by signing an agreement with Switzerland limiting the EU’s scope for action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to you to take an initiative: EUR 200 billion is a very large sum. We cannot ask European taxpayers to show solidarity if rich Greek citizens do not show any either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Greece and other countries are suffering from a crisis of competitiveness. They are suffering from a crisis of excessive debt. Listening to this debate this morning, it seems obvious to me that that crisis will not solved by eurobonds. It will not be solved by imposing yet more high-interest loans on Greece. It will not be solved by a financial transaction tax. In particular, it will not be solved by a theological debate about whether it is best to have the intergovernmental method, or the Community method, or other such bizarre solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that we have now reached such a stage that the only solution is for Greece to devalue, to leave the euro and to default on its debts. That will be extremely difficult. It will be extremely painful. However, it is now the least bad option that is facing us to try a get a solution to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I completely disagree: Europe is not on the brink of disaster. We are experiencing an institutional crisis, a crisis of responsibility, but not a deep-seated crisis affecting the European institutions as a whole, and that is where it is also important to assume responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you spoke of the cacophony of opinions. Your letter of 3 August did nothing to reduce this cacophony. You said that we have lost too much time. We waited four and half years for the proposals from your first Commission with regard to regulation of the financial markets. I would like to make it very clear that you have the right of initiative and you have the responsibility and the opportunity to put forward proposals in order to force the governments to act. I can, to some extent, understand the lack of confidence of the Heads of State or Government in the ability of the Commission to act. Monitoring of the implementation of European legal acts, monitoring of the allocation of resources from the Structural Funds – what has Greece done then? Seventy per cent is unused – monitoring of the Commission’s own ability to act reveals nothing but deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, in your speech on the State of the Union in two weeks’ time you have a unique opportunity to put forward proposals with regard to economic governance, the European Monetary Fund, realisation of the internal market, monitoring of the implementation of legislation, against individual States going it alone, and with regard to the amendment of the Treaties. We call on you to have the courage to do this. You will have the Members of this House on your side.</p>

Economic deceleration, the collapse of the stock markets and financial tensions are the price we must pay for a weak response.</p>
<p class="contents">Our immediate priorities are Greece, financial stability and economic growth. The Greek government must receive clear support from the Union in its efforts to re-establish growth. This dissonance must end; it is now time to comply with the agreements reached on 21 July 2011, including a ‘Marshall plan’ that is worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial stability is vital for the euro. The European Central Bank has a particular responsibility while the Union does not have effective capacities in the area of fiscal policy. The eurozone is based on fixed interest rates, but not on exchange rates that can respond to unlimited differentiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must ensure that its financial entities do not pose a systemic risk, and that they complete their recapitalisation processes adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is growth. In the last decade, the eurozone has grown less than any other region in the world. The surplus economies should expand demand. Low interest rates in the medium term could alleviate debt and help kick-start our economies.

As many of you are well aware, Finland has demanded collateral in return for participating in the support package for Greece, something that is problematic from both an economic and a political point of view. I would like to say straight away that I personally do not support the government’s demand for this collateral, as I believe that it is unreasonable in relation to what other euro area States are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it may be a good idea to consider what is behind this demand. What it actually boils down to is the fact that there is a lack of confidence and trust in the measures that we, in particular the Council and the Commission, have jointly taken to solve the crisis. This lack of confidence is not just found in the Finnish Parliament; it is also present among the public at large, which is something that we need to deal with. Unfortunately, I have to say that, in this respect, I also share the opinion of the people. It is sadly the case that, as a politician, I recognise that it is political will that is needed in order to deal with this crisis, but, as an economist, I have to say that the measures that have been taken up to now in order to rescue Greece, among other things, are unfortunately wholly inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to say that, in this debate, it could easily be the case that Germany, Finland and other countries are held to account for us not managing to deal with the crisis now. It is certainly the case that the eurosceptic mood is problematic, but we must not forget that this is not the crux of the problem. The problem is that certain euro area States have been living above their means for years. Let us not forget that that is the fundamental problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are occurring at a time of unprecedented turmoil in the global economies around the world. Collectively, Europe needs to raise trillions of euros to fund the 27 economies; the Member States need investors to purchase their sovereign bond issuances. So what the market thinks is actually very important. For as long as we need money from the markets, whether for sovereign or EFSF bonds, we need to listen to what they are saying.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently their message is very clear. Italian bonds issued this week saw very low demand at very high rates, despite the purchasing of billions of Italian and Spanish bonds by the ECB in the secondary market. This week, the interest rate for Italian bonds has again reached 5.75%, which is hardly sustainable for the third-largest bond market in the world. The markets are pricing in a 98% chance of a default in Greece. Are all the experts in the world wrong? Who is going to buy the debt if it is not the investors? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not only concern Greece. It is not just that there are conflicting fiscal policies in the euro area. The risk of a possible new agreement within the framework of the European Union on the debt of its Member States looms large before the people; we are facing the possibility of a new international economic crisis before real recovery sets in, a new round of destruction of productive forces, at an incalculable cost to the working and grassroots classes.</p>
<p class="contents">The controlled bankruptcy of Greece, the depreciation of capital that it plans for banks and other parties holding government bonds, now appears tiny compared with what is needed in order to get the capitalist machine rolling again. It will be as difficult for the governments of the European Union to agree on which monopolies and which of their funds will be destroyed and which will stand to gain as it is easy for them to agree to shatter labour and grassroots rights. What the European Union – capital and the bourgeois governments – agree on is the uncontrolled bankruptcy of the people, by shattering labour and grassroots rights …..</p>

In other words, the EU is evolving into a larger version of Belgium, which is a far from appealing thought. We have also seen evidence that the successive bailouts are failing to get us anywhere with a country like Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, two things we could do: rush into another radical plan, as the de Verhofstadts of this Parliament would like us to do, with a kind of super-state government, with European taxes and Eurobonds, thus constructing a European public debt on top of the national public debts. Well, there is no democratic support for that. Such plans would immediately, and rightly, be rejected by the voters, if given a chance. We could also seek realistic solutions, such as showing Greece the door, as far as the euro area is concerned. That would be the best option in the long term, both for Greece itself and for the euro area. The longer we wait, the more money it will cost and the bigger the problems will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this is the case because, as you have already explained, the 21 July agreement, for example, has not been swiftly ratified, approved or implemented by many of the governments of the Member States.

Perhaps now is the time to undertake a critical review of the policies implemented up to now: have things always been done well? Have we always analysed the situation correctly? Has the right approach been chosen? Has the European Central Bank which, as Minister Rostoski said, has saved Europe, always taken the correct course of action, even when it has raised interest rates through fear of inflation?</p>

Of course, if we consider that we are still implementing the 21 July agreement, this ought at least to suggest that we need to prepare for and organise summits and their conclusions better, but policy will always lag behind the markets. We therefore need to look further, concentrating our efforts on combating unemployment and encouraging growth. These are the areas that the European Commission should focus on; even today in President Barroso’s speech, there was more substance with regard to the deficit than with regard to signs of growth and development.</p>

Italy has a debt totalling 130% of their gross domestic product and the Irish budget deficit is 10%. However, Greece has notched up the most dismal score of all: a debt equivalent to 157% of their GDP and a budget deficit of nearly 8%. Even the legendary Greek character Atlas had a lighter burden to shoulder. Greece will never be able to repay that debt, and so part of that debt will have to be written off. There will have to be effective participation from the private sector, too.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a recovery plan for the Greek economy to enable it to actually repay the remaining debt, and the Greeks must show full commitment to raising taxes. If these measures are not taken very soon, Greece will have to leave the euro.

<p class="contents">I would like to raise a purely technical issue in relation to this point. Since we recognise that a Member State may default, it is now crucial to define rules to govern this situation. When a business becomes insolvent, there are exceptional rules to protect it. However, there are no such rules for Member States, because it has long been accepted that Member States cannot default. Yet, the example of Greece clearly shows that constant pressure on a Member State prevents planned measures from being implemented effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that the European Union must decide, within the framework of the euro area, which rules shall prevail. Membership of the euro area creates an original and ambiguous situation for every Member State: it is no longer the one issuing its currency, but its financial policy is still out of sync with that of the other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the first imperative is the rapid completion of the economic policy coordination arrangements and of the European Stability Mechanism, but we also need to establish the rules that will apply in this area. In the case of countries under arrangements with the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, this would involve introducing provisions to freeze clauses concerning early repayment, forfeit of terms or credit events, which are today standing in the way of a genuine recovery. Introducing such provisions would ensure both transparency and credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, as we all know, Greece has been making a huge effort for the last eighteen months to correct in a very short space of time not only deficits, but also decades of distortions, mistakes, shortcomings and omissions. This is an exceptionally difficult undertaking which has brought about results and which has had successes, as well, of course, as delays in its application, because a programme on paper is one thing and its application in practice is another. We also all know that Greece recently adopted additional fiscal and structural measures to speed up its effort and will be judged on their application.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only Greece that will be judged. We are all being judged. We are being judged, primarily, on the tolerance and complicity which we have demonstrated in what were, until recently, inconceivable debates, such as the bankruptcy, controlled or otherwise, of a Member State of the euro area, with or without its exit from the euro.

Localism is not Eurosceptic opportunism or protectionism; far too often, decisions are taken by this House without even considering whether that decision could be taken locally or nationally.</p>
<p class="contents">The resulting legislation often adds bureaucracy costs and stifles investment. Yes, we need to mend our public finances, but we must also improve competitiveness and cut those costs. For example, we do need international agreement on banks, but we do not need every mortgage offer to every resident in every country to be identical. Yes, we should work together when necessary, but we must also give back responsibility to our citizens and our governments wherever possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice. It is now being demanded that the Union show leadership, and that the mechanisms for governing and decision-making function in real time. The monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs economic governance, a common budget, a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan. Therefore, we first need to regulate public accounts, correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness. No country should spend more than its economic growth allows.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable. The European Union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the Community method: a European Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to see leadership, ladies and gentlemen, then those decisions must be driven by Parliament and the Commission, rather than by the Council, which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments. It is the responsibility of Member States to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the Union as a whole, and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task: achieve economic growth and create employment.</p>
<p class="contents">More than one year ago in Spain, the leader of the Popular Party, Mr Rajoy, expressed his support in the Spanish Parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution.

The first is that, when we read what the World Bank says, when we read what Ms Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund says, it would seem that we are on the brink of a recession. The growth engines have failed. Where are the investments? That is the urgent question for the European Union. I would like to ask you: you refer to the Stability and Growth Pact – where are the investments? You wanted to cut everything do with investments. So, where are the investments? Where can we cooperate so that we can move forward in Europe once again? We Social Democrats are willing to help in finding a strategy that will allow us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is this: how can we enter into a common bond market? Here, too, you can be sure of our support. Please put forward proposals.

I would like to congratulate him on having made a balanced yet robust defence of the Community method. I am absolutely convinced that there is no prospect of us overcoming this crisis unless we use the Community method. Moreover, use of the Community method requires a completely firm and determined attitude on the part of Parliament and its Members in support of the Commission’s efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often said that the Commission needs to be more proactive. I too am of that opinion. However, the fact is that the proposal relating to project bonds is already on the table. Here in Parliament we already have the proposal to increase the flexibility of funds to countries that are the subject of intervention, whether they are members of the euro or are outside the euro area, which will enable the allocation of resources to these countries, in order that there may be growth whilst austerity programmes are ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also had the news here today that there will be a properly balanced proposal to bring in Eurobonds, either in a form compatible with the current Treaties, or in a form which may mean institutional reform. We have also had this news here. Of course, we also know that this proposal has to be balanced, because it is not enough simply to introduce Eurobonds. That is only one possible variable in solving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">What I mean by this is that we now have an array of solutions which have already been identified by the Commission, and all that is needed is our enthusiastic backing in the week of the State of the Union Address, in order to support the Commission as it puts forward a solution to the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The euro and the steps taken in Europe were political decisions. They were taken by our leaders. They were not random developments and it is only with political decisions that we can respond to the crisis. Therefore, yes, we must abide by the Community method. Support from the Union is a political decision and we condemn any speculators ready to take advantage of unfortunate and inaccurate statements. We have instruments to deal with the crisis and we can create more. We have the European Semester and its evaluation, project bonds and Eurobonds, the EU 2020 strategy, the multiannual financial framework, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism and we have a European Commission which, based on the institutions, can and must take initiatives. Therefore, no one is asking for powers to be taken away from governments; however, the three institutions must work together on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Greece is concerned, it is not the only problem in the euro area. I should like to say to everyone who has said that Greece will default that our country will not default.

All these proposals, issuing from all quarters, are causing confusion and creating an image of a Europe which is rudderless. I totally agree with you, President Barroso, that we need a step-by-step approach, but we are counting on the Commission to be the helmsman. If we want to succeed, then we need a single scenario, we need to be unanimous and discreet in our communication and we must now make it our priority to carry out the plans we have already agreed on, instead of putting forward new plans all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we first have to solve the acute problem and do everything possible to help Greece out of the morass. This also means that all politicians should summon the courage to explain to their citizens that solidarity with other countries of the euro area will be the best deal for everyone in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have to carry out structural changes, which, in other words, means that at the end of September we need to approve a robust six-pack in this House. These and other financial and economic measures are incredibly important, not only to recovering the confidence of the markets, but also to boosting our self-confidence as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what this means is that, in the long term, we will also have to address other system errors, even if that means amending treaties.

They concern the profession that I am involved in, as these are problems with the profession of politics. How do we, as elected representatives, deliver better for our citizens? How do we tell them the harsh messages that they may not want to hear, but which we need to deliver to them in order to make progress? We need to look at ourselves to find those answers.

<p class="contents">The only solution is to help Greece: firstly by honouring our commitments; secondly by giving the country time; thirdly by helping it to conduct and successfully carry through the structural reforms it requires; and finally, by providing its people with prospects and guaranteeing those prospects. Only if we do that will Greece get back on its feet, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the crisis of confidence in the euro has reached such a level that we obviously cannot stop there. We need to implement these Eurobonds, which we have now been discussing for months, pool a proportion of eurozone Members’ debt up to 60% of GDP, and make progress on the issues of economic governance and of political governance, too, which has been very unsatisfactory during the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through spending cuts and reform. Both are painful, but essential for healthy finances, better competitiveness and sufficient earning power. Procrastination in that respect will be punished by the financial markets and it is the politicians’ job to steer an appropriate and consistent course.</p>
<p class="contents">However, something further is needed in order to reach a genuine solution. Several euro area countries have a high level of foreign debt. This is down to the trade balance and the balance of payments not being in equilibrium. A Dutch academic has called for a new Bretton Woods Accord that would restore the balance between the two, through, for example, regulation that restricts the extent to which the financial sector can finance other countries’ high trade deficits. Do the Commission and the Council view this as a good proposal for reducing this structural imbalance?</p>

Interest rates are too high for southern European countries that are in recession, because they have been raised to curb inflationary pressures in Germany. This has exacerbated the recession and led to falling government revenues and increased government debt. Furthermore, the percentage return, or coupon, on sovereign bonds has had to be higher because of diminished confidence and fear of default.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB was already buying small countries’ sovereign debt and has recently started to buy Spanish and Italian bonds to instil confidence. While this might postpone the crisis, there is a real danger that the ECB will purchase bonds the market value of which will eventually fall, as has occurred with the bonds from Greece, Ireland and Portugal. And even an institution like the ECB cannot survive a massive fall in the assets on its balance sheet without huge recapitalisation at the expense of taxpayers in the eurozone and outside it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, honourable Members, let me first of all thank you on our behalf for a very substantive and responsible debate which reflects the depth of the current crisis and the concerns we have about its consequences for ordinary citizens in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing is that the real economy, growth and employment are now under extreme pressure from the negative ramifications stemming from the continued market turbulence related to the sovereign debt crisis. Therefore, the necessary condition to protect economic growth and job creation – economic recovery – is to contain the turbulence and reinforce our economic governance, to create solid foundations for the continuation of the recovery, sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have criticised the EU’s response to the crisis as too slow and ineffective and then pointed the finger at the Commission. Frankly, that misses the target For instance, when we talk about eurobonds, already at the critical meeting of 9 and 10 May 2010 we proposed the European Financial Stability Mechanism that would be operated by joint and several guarantees. However, this was rejected by Member States in the Council because for them they resembled eurobonds too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, concerning the reform and reinforcement of the European Financial Stability Facility, we proposed that in our annual growth survey on 12 January. President Barroso reinforced the message and called for the conclusion of that work by the summit in early February. And where are we now? We are, I trust, finally carrying out this operation, getting the reformed, reinforced and more flexible EFSF operational as of October onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">So, it is the excess of intergovernmentalism and the deficit of the Community method that is hampering our actions, and that is the real problem in terms of EU economic governance. Let us be honest about this; let us be frank and open about this. Therefore, I agree with all those of you who have said that deeper economic integration and policy coordination is one key remedy to the crisis. Certainly not the only one – no silver bullet – but a necessary condition for the solution of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We must be able to decide more quickly and more effectively and we must be much better in the implementation of our decisions in the European Union. The current institutional structures are not sufficient to tackle the challenges we are currently facing. As President Barroso said, we need <span class="italic">un nouveau moment fédérateur</span> and that moment must start today.</p>
<p class="contents">This calls for a very thorough public debate in our Member States and in this context I dare to say that the European Parliament is the institution and you, as representatives of our citizens as Members of the European Parliament, are the representatives who have a major responsibility and a major opportunity to pursue this debate, stimulate this debate and participate in this debate, as you have a very special democratic interface with the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In the immediate short term let me underline the importance of implementation of the decisions of the eurozone summit. I cannot stress enough the importance of swift implementation of the decisions taken. Especially by increasing the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF and the ESM, we can act earlier and more effectively to ensure financial stability in Europe. Therefore, ratification of the agreed reform of the EFSF in the Member States is a very clear and urgent priority. Moreover, rapid implementation of the decisions is essential for addressing the debt crisis and restoring confidence in our economies and therefore I expect that the Euro Group meeting this Friday in Wroclaw will overcome the remaining hurdles and get the job finally done.</p>
<p class="contents">On Greece, let me say a word to those suggesting that Greece would be better off outside the Europe. I very strongly disagree. Neither Greece nor the eurozone would be better off. Whatever way you look at it, it is absolutely certain that a default and/or exit of Greece from the eurozone would carry dramatic economic, social and political costs, not only for Greece but also for all other euro area Member States and EU Member States, as well as for our global partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is an active debate on EU economic governance and there definitely is a need to rethink our institutional structures. There are also currently high expectations of how eurobonds could help solve the debt crisis by pooling the debt issuance of euro area Member States. To my mind it is clear that eurobonds, in whatever form they might be introduced, would have to be accompanied by substantially reinforced fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart, so as to avoid moral hazard and to ensure sustainable public finances. Of course this would have implications for the fiscal sovereignty of Member States, which calls for a substantive debate in the euro area Member States to see if they would be ready to accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the very short term, yet another plea and I trust this is the very final plea on this issue. In the very short term, the conclusion of the legislative package on EU economic governance is the crucial step forward in strengthening fiscal surveillance and reinforcing the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances, and here I look both to the Council and to Parliament. We need urgent approval of the six-pack by the end of this month; let us vote on 28 September please. I mean you vote; I witness and I endorse with all my spirit and sympathy. Urgent approval of the six-pack is not only important in its own right; it is a necessary foundation for any further progress in economic governance. President Barroso will deliver his State of the Union speech here in Strasbourg at the next plenary session, where he will outline the Commission’s proposals on how to further develop the economic governance of the euro area and of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So to conclude: what we need now is to implement the decisions to reinforce economic governance and our instruments for ensuring financial stability in order to safeguard financial stability and economic growth and job creation, to consistently continue to improve public finances and undertake reforms that can boost economic growth and job creation, and to conclude the six-pack in order to create the foundations for a real economic union and thus move to the next stage in economic integration towards a deeper economic and political integration.</p>

As both Mr Barroso and Mr Rehn said, this is something specific which we now have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make brief reference to what was said by Mr Bokros, whom I esteem highly as I know he is a former minister of finance. It is obvious that finance ministers have to do their job, but to do this they need time, because economies, too, have to have the opportunity to adjust to the steps we take. Today, however, in the short time horizon, we are seeing panic in the treasury markets of some countries. The European Central Bank cannot allow any of these countries to become insolvent, because this would lead to the complete collapse of the banking system of the entire euro area and the entire European Union. We know, too, that we would not then have any monetary policy at all, just monetary chaos. Therefore I think the measures taken by the European Central Bank were most certainly justified, appropriate, necessary and courageous.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz has comforted me by saying that everything will be alright. I must admit that in our part of Europe, history – including the worst periods of history – is perhaps a little more recent than the history of Western Europe. For us, the end of history was a great liberation. I appeal to the whole House: we must not allow history, in the bad sense of those words, to return. It is clear we have to save Europe. If we do not do so, who will? If we do not do so now, when will we? I would like to address my final words to Mr Farage. He said he has the impression he is attending a funeral but does not know whose. I will answer him in English: Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro was never an economic project. It was a political project designed to help bring about a United States of Europe. Once of the vital attributes of a state is its currency and that is why the European Union forced through the introduction of the euro against all the sensible advice against it. You do not have to be an economist to know that to constrain a number of completely different economies within a single interest rate and exchange rate will, over time, bring nothing but problems and eventual disaster. That is what we are seeing now, and of course Mr Barroso is calling for full economic and financial governance of the eurozone countries by the European Union. The crisis was entirely predictable and so was Mr Barroso’s proposed solution. The euro is going to come apart. It is just a question of time. The longer it takes the worse the crash is going to be. The people to blame are those who forced the economies of the eurozone into an economic straightjacket in order to serve a political dogma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bizarrely enough, the action we need to take today is much simpler in nature. In brief, what it boils down to is the fact that we have to put a stop to all this cacophony, we have to be clearly united in our credo that the euro area is a single and indivisible entity and that, in times of crisis like today, we have to be prepared to take draconian steps to safeguard that unity. Responsible politicians have to stop broadcasting scenarios of Greece potentially having to leave the euro area. Because we simply cannot even contemplate going there. This crisis is a huge acid test for solidarity within the EU and, in particular, within the euro area. At the same time, it is a great opportunity to firm up our internal consistency.

The bleak prospects of a few months ago now look even blacker. The crisis is deepening rapidly. In this situation, it is increasingly clear that the leaders of the EU are in a state of utter confusion. It is also increasingly clear that the EU institutions and the powers that have been driving the integration process have nothing to offer the people of Europe but a major backwards step for civilisation. Straining at the leash to push on blindly is the only approach that they know and suggest. This is a dangerous path, as it is based on going further with the ideas that have led us here. Their inability to solve this crisis is, in fact, structural. The crisis is simultaneously an expression of the uneven development of capitalism in the EU, namely the asymmetrical interdependence that relegates countries such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland to a subordinate position that is dependent on the process of capitalist integration, and also of the deregulation of capital markets and the financialisation of the economy, which have paved the way for all kinds of speculation and extortion. For this very reason, the crisis will not be solved by persisting with these two factors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, certain Member States take practical action. However, their situation is not made easy if their work is downgraded at every turn in various ways. I am referring to the irresponsible and completely unjustified manifestations of credit rating agencies, and to a few unfortunate assertions made by the Commission. Not only were crisis management tools not available in good time, but I feel that even today the Commission has no solid, forward-looking recommendations, even though it is clear that Member States are becoming increasingly exposed without clear guidelines.

Part of this development is the creation of the Schengen system and the introduction of the single currency. The latter, however, has proven to be incomplete: the monetary union is not supplemented by a single economic and budgetary policy. This led to decline in a few EU Member States and at the same time to the crisis affecting the entire euro area. The European Union is once again at a crossroads: it either steps back to settle for a more relaxed cooperation and bears all the grave consequences entailed, or it implements relatively quickly the economic and financial integration within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">This requires strong European control, which the European Parliament, the most democratic institution of the EU, has been urging for a long time. It is clearly in the interest of Hungary and the other states outside the euro area to have the monetary union strengthened further and therefore to be able to belong to a community that provides economic and financial stability for them as well. The eurosceptic, belligerent, populist rhetorics and the false prominence attached to our sovereignty undermine Hungary’s chances for catching up, and reinforce the arguments of those who are already fond of plans for the creation of a multi-speed Europe. Hungary must support all efforts aimed at deepening the economic integration between Member States and reinforcing the fundamental democratic values of the EU.

This agreement will lead us further down the path of austerity at a time when the need for strategic investment to create jobs and growth has never been more acute. I will be working with my fellow MEPs in an effort to rebalance this package in the coming weeks. I also urge the Commission to submit proposals to strengthen financial regulation, including the possibility of establishing a European ratings agency, as soon as possible. The greed of banks and hedge funds, coupled with a lack of rigorous regulation, were the primary causes of the current crisis. It is imperative, therefore, to ensure that in future, financial institutions serve the broader economy and society as a whole; taxpayer bailouts must be conditional upon banks providing services and credit to citizens and SMEs as opposed to simply paying down debts built up due to their own speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the preconditions of European integration was to establish a single internal market in the EU based on the principle of the four freedoms, which the single currency of the euro was also supposed to promote. Over time, however, the establishment of a currency union without an adequate fiscal and institutional framework has proven to be difficult. In my opinion, a comprehensive solution to the current crisis should cover the following three areas: the financial sector, fiscal policy and the competitiveness of the Economic and Monetary Union and the EU. It must first restore confidence in the EU’s financial sector, where key roles must be played on the one hand by the ECB (by providing liquidity to the banks and purchasing government bonds) and also the European Banking Authority, which is the banking regulator and which should, among other things, guarantee the credibility of EU bank stress testing. Secondly, the fiscal policy of EU countries should be strengthened by issuing eurobonds and by introducing a financial transaction tax (including a more active role for the European Parliament and national parliaments in this process). Thirdly, in the long term, the sustainable economic development and competitiveness of the EU will be important. Strict compliance with the Euro Plus Pact will be necessary, including an emphasis on efficient allocations from European funds after 2014, as well as compliance with conditionality requirements. Overall, I believe that the EU has the tools to resolve the situation, and that it will successfully overcome this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The extensive indebtedness of households and state budgets, fostered by the illusion of cheap money and the dream of a rosy future, suddenly broke the spell of the financial markets, and this was followed by a swift spread of distrust and fear of losses. This panic is just as exaggerated as the earlier euphoria. However, while before, when the bubble or state debt was growing, everybody seemed to be doing well, what we now see is an actual shrinkage. The crisis does not affect people everywhere and to the same extent, but everybody is getting less than they would if the whole European economy was healthy and trust was restored. In my home country, tens of thousands took out Swiss franc loans, offered abundantly by banks up to October 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, many have lost their jobs due to the crisis, the property market collapsed, and as a result of the crisis of confidence already mentioned, the Swiss franc became significantly stronger. All these factors together threw thousands into a hopeless situation. ‘More Europe’, more solidarity would provide the way out. However, in some places it is selfish concern, and in others it is fear from the pain inflicted by restoration that hinder rapid and decisive decisions and actions. In this state of paralysis, Europe is drifting helplessly towards the vortex of crisis. I hope we all wake up before it is too late. A weak Europe falling apart can hardly fend off the challenges of the future. It is still not too late, but there is no time for further delay, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The eurozone is at serious risk of losing its credibility, first due to an irresponsible style of living that includes consuming more than we earn, and secondly to the fact that the EU has not been able to react decisively enough and in a more coordinated way to the crisis. The key problem now is to act to repair the hole in the bottom of the European boat. New loans may be necessary but, if the hole is not repaired by cutting expenses and conducting serious structural reforms, the credibility crisis cannot be overcome. Latvia was in the deepest crisis three years ago but restructuring and streamlining the economy and cutting its expenditure by 20% has restored Latvia’s credibility. If needed, the country has no problem in taking out loans on favourable conditions. The most practical way to restore the EU’s credibility is for the Commission to come forward with concrete far-reaching new initiatives to deepen the internal market. The internal market is the very foundation of the EU. However, there are still hundreds of obstacles to its completion; the services sector especially comes to mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debt crisis is a threat not only to national economies, but has also revealed the weakness of the EU’s institutional architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, the Union must act effectively on two fronts – the institutional and the economic. The crisis has exposed the weakness of a crisis management system which has many actors. It is difficult, today, to say unequivocally who takes decisions and who takes responsibility for them – we are seeing the phenomenon of dispersal of responsibility. The effect of this is a multiplicity of conflicting announcements. It seems that effective management is possible today only at EU level, because only such a strategy will allow us to avoid fragmentation of the Union or – in the worst case – the appearance of a two-speed Europe. Institutional reform would allow EU bodies to rebuild their credibility and restore faith in the process of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament we have said a lot about debt in relation to national economies. We must, however, remember that debt is not only the cause of the crisis, but is also a consequence of it. A rise in debt is not dangerous as long as it is accompanied by economic growth. If it were not for the lack of competitiveness which has emerged in the permanently weak economic growth of some countries, no one would be talking about a crisis today. What we need is reforms which allow a fall in debt but which also ensure the long-term financing of growth. The stability of public finances is not enough in the long-term perspective; we need sustainable economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis has revealed blatantly that the economic system in Europe as we know it today can no longer be sustained. In fact, most of the EU countries seriously need to review their economic and social policies in order to avoid falling into financial difficulties. Keeping that in mind, we can support Greece only on the condition that Greece makes further cuts in its expenditure and reforms its economy, starting with an extensive privatisation programme. If Greece fails to comply then the rescue package will only be able to alleviate the symptoms, but not treat the actual cause of their problems. The success of the recovery from the economic crisis at large depends first and foremost on each and every Member State and their strict and persistent adherence to the common rules as well as their dynamism in adapting to a different global economic environment. The EU economic governance package will surely be an important step forward, but earnest will and effort by the Member States must come first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Solidarity among the countries of the EU must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and compliance with the rules, which the States cannot and must not infringe. However, solidarity cannot and must not be one-sided: being part of a Union with shared ideals and values means committing oneself to growth and development and supporting each other even in times of trouble. We are promoting the concept of a social market economy, but one in which the emphasis is mostly on the market, with the social aspect overlooked. We have weakened the Stability and Growth Pact. This was a mistake, and we are paying the price for it. We need to go back to having rules on budgetary discipline, and procedures must be automatic. It is a good idea for the constitutions to include the principle of balanced budgets, but it should be achieved by combining rigour and consolidation of public finances with growth. I say this because, if we do constrain our public budgets with very strict rules, we should also introduce measures to ensure growth.

We have pooled our currency, let us now establish a genuine economic government and bring our fiscal policies into line, as Germany and France are proposing. Above all, let us not lose sight of the fact that we are acting on behalf of the people of Europe.

The daily turmoil that is rocking governments, stock markets and banks is a sign of worse to come if Europe does not respond immediately. What are the causes of this crisis? To begin with, there is a structural flaw: how can we guarantee the long-term stability of a single currency without establishing proper budgetary coordination? The old stability pact was weak and detached from reality. The second reason is the economic climate: for a long time now, and more markedly since the economic crisis of 2008, governments have been hit-and-miss in the way they have managed public expenditure. This must stop. Lastly, the crisis has been made worse by the political selfishness of some States, who tinker here and there according to their short-term interests and the latest opinion polls. France and Germany have proposed solutions, which are necessary, but will not be enough. The response must come from Europe itself. Will the EU dare to take the leap of faith of true integration, in which each member expresses solidarity for the sake of growth for all?

Careful consideration must be given to the introduction of Eurobonds in the near future and to the inevitable tighter political coordination related to this, because the only alternatives are never-ending rescue packages or the bankruptcy of states in difficulty. It is gratifying that the European Commission, too, acknowledged the necessity of this when it promised to draft a proposal. It is similarly gratifying that the French-German summit in the summer seemed to suggest that even the European right-wing has finally acknowledged that austerity measures are not enough, and that the burdens of the crisis need to be distributed much more fairly than at present between the already overburdened European citizens and the financial sector, which has so far failed to share them. Therefore the introduction of the financial transaction tax proposed by the Socialists is now also supported by the European right-wing. This tax – cleverly calibrated – needs to be introduced as quickly as possible, and its introduction must be accompanied by a much stricter monitoring of the financial markets. I am confident that the Commission will submit a proposal for this, too, in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a solution to the crisis, the Presidency and the Commission are calling for the six-pack to be approved, but this is a quick fix. The six-pack does not answer the question of how we can develop a socioeconomic policy which will generate sustainable prosperity for all Europeans in the long term. It speaks only in terms of monitoring and punishment and, yet, remains silent as the grave about investment in education, human capital, innovation and infrastructure. Obviously, there can be no solidarity without budgetary responsibility. However, making the patient better means that you have to cut away any excess fat without removing any muscle and sometimes you even have to administer more oxygen.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission will finally come up with specific proposals for introducing Eurobonds, but I fear that this might actually be too little too late. Such a show of European solidarity should obviously be accompanied by a stricter European control of the budgets. However, it is not just spending that needs to be better managed: that applies to revenue, as well. We are in favour of fair revenues, a European corporation tax and a financial transaction tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are united in diversity – but despite, and precisely because of, this unity it is clear that all citizens are being asked very forcefully to play their part. This starts with the States that must fulfil their financial obligations; however, it also requires all citizens of the relevant countries that are in debt and have got into difficulties to take responsibility: entirely in the spirit of solidarity – a question of give and take. It cannot be possible for the responsibility to fall solely on our citizens. In the long term, more Europe means more investment in education for all of our citizens – in that way we will create the opportunity for new and sustainable jobs, and if there are more jobs, there will be more tax revenue for the State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union is at a crossroads where it needs to choose between going further down the path of integration and pulling back. We are at a crucial juncture when we must decide whether we are going to continue the European project involving economic integration, expansion of the single market and consolidation of EMU or whether we are going to allow the creation of a single Europe to be scuppered in a quagmire of populism, extremism and isolationism.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis the EU is going through requires a European solution, not a sum of national responses. It is not enough for us to take note of and reiterate this point. A solution needs to be implemented as a supportive European response. We need to put these measures into action immediately and set up the European institutions proposed by the European economic governance package. However, we also need a European government, at euro area level to begin with.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, we need a European Parliament with extended powers to manage the process of deepening European integration as the ongoing transfer of sovereignty must be guaranteed by a single European institution elected directly by the EU’s 500 million citizens. This will ensure that Europe’s citizens are the real winners from the process of deepening European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of finally asking governments to take responsibility for managing their own economies, we are proposing more centralisation. In other words, we want to take more and more responsibility away from the governments of the Member States. First we want to set tax and deficit levels, then we want to define individual expenditure items until in the end our governments will be nothing more than disengaged departments of the central administration in Brussels. At the end of the day, we would not have to think up new rules if we finally started to abide by the ones we already have. The criteria for joining the eurozone may be excessively simple, but at least it means they are clear. Let us finally start living by them. If a country is unable to abide by the undertakings it made when it joined the eurozone, it should leave. As a doctor I know that the greater the threat of a particular disease, the more important it is to work together with those affected by it. Constantly trying out new, untested procedures leads to mistrust among the people threatened by infection. Let us not think up further solutions before we have heard the people and national governments. Today these people are asking us how things have come to this. Let us be frank with them and the solution will emerge for us all to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
