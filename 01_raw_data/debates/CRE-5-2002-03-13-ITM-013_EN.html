<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pérez Royo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, so that we can gauge the importance of this debate, I should like to start by reminding you of the remote origins of this proposal for a directive; the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements of 24 June 1988. The authors of this directive were aware of the opportunities arising for the evasion of national capital gains tax as a result of this liberalisation, by investing in a country other than the investor’s country of residence; to summarise this situation, we can say that the risk was, and continues to be, that each Member State, each member of the single market that was being set up at that time and is now up and running, would act as a tax haven for the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This risk, as I said, was highlighted by the authors of the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements, who called on the Commission and the Council to legislate on this matter, the fiscal aspect of the liberalisation of capital movements, within one year, that is to say, in 1989. The Commission, and the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Scrivener, presented its proposal on time, but this proposal, basically consisting of the introduction of a deduction at source – withholding tax – for payments to residents in other Member States, was not accepted by the Council and was rejected, and became a sort of abortive legislation. In 1997, the Commission made a new proposal, within the so-called Monti package, based on the coexistence model, on which Parliament was able to draw up a report, but at the end of the day this did not receive unanimous support from the Council either. The next step in this process is the Santa María de Feira Agreement, in which the European Council – that is to say the Heads of State and Government – taking a proposal from the Ecofin Council, reached a political agreement in principle on the basis of the points I will now explain.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Member States would be committed to setting up a system for information exchange with regard to the payment of interest to a resident of another Member State, that is to say, this would involve the lifting of banking secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and as an exceptional and transitional system, it has been stated that certain States, Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg to be precise, should apply, in place of this information exchange – in other words, instead of the lifting of banking secrecy – a system for deduction at source.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the implementation of the whole of this legal framework was dependent and still is dependent on negotiations with third countries, such as Switzerland, the United States and Andorra, for the application of equivalent measures, and the application of the same measures by the Member States in territories dependent on those Member States, such as the Channel Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion on the proposal for a Directive applying these Feira guidelines is entirely positive. We believe, in general terms, that this is in line with the approach taken by the OECD, which is, at this time, the most active forum for discussion in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem with this scheme, and I will conclude on this note, Madam President – and this cannot escape anyone’s attention – are the negotiations with third countries. In other words, the problem is how to get Switzerland to lift its banking secrecy. However, at the risk of appearing to be a naive optimist, I should like to remind you that everything in life is subject to change and that not even Swiss banking secrecy is what it once was. I should specifically like to draw your attention to the following fact; the United States has been able, by means of an internal regulation, to implement a regulation, the so-called Qualified Intermediary Agreement, by virtue of which the Swiss banks and those from other countries are obliged to communicate to the Internal Revenue Service profits made by an American client – a US person – from assets which are also American, to lift banking secrecy with regard to these payments or even to apply a deduction at source of 30%. Nobody can escape the fact that this regulation can be avoided simply by investing in non-American assets. Recognising that the cases are not precisely the same, with regard to the fight against terrorism, in this case we also find ourselves up against the limitations of the unilateral approach in the fight against improper practices, in this case tax evasion at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I must emphasise the positive contribution a joint action by the European Union and the United States could make in this area. We believe that this should be the path to follow in negotiations with the United States and with other countries. We have faith – and on this note I shall end, Madam President – in the Commission’s ability, and that they will know how to provide the impetus for these negotiations, which will provide a solution to this problem of the taxation of savings, which, to tell the truth, should have been resolved some time ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who, especially during the debate and then with countless amendments, have helped to improve this report and, I believe, to finalise a text which I hope will please both the Committee and this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives a generally favourable verdict on two Commission communications: one on fiscal policy strategies, and one on a strategy for a consolidated tax base for Europe-wide companies. The verdict is generally favourable as regards the identification of their general objectives and the instruments that can be used to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part of the report stresses that the constant growth of the tax burden over the last twenty years – something that has only slowed down slightly and has not stopped completely in the last couple of years – may well be one of the reasons for the poor growth in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">By stressing that a certain level of tax competition might be inevitable and might help to reduce tax pressure, the Commission communications appropriately recognise that it has a useful role in the context of rules preventing improper conduct. The report takes up the principle of tax competition and emphasises it, pointing out that it is compatible – as the experience of recent years has shown – with constant coordination of fiscal regulations aimed at eliminating barriers to the internal market. Tax competition is compatible with the completion of the internal market, which does not imply the absolute levelling-out of competitive conditions, and tax competition is just one of the many variables that determine the competitive regime within each country and between different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax competition, as has been pointed out by the Nobel prize-winner, Robert Mundell, one of the recognised fathers of the single currency, does not run counter even to the introduction of the euro. Moreover, in connection with tax competition, it should be reiterated that in reality there is no sign of any ‘race to the bottom’, that fall in tax revenue that many often dread, fearing that there might be a shortfall in the resources needed by the State. We have seen that, in a situation of tax competition, taxation has in fact continued to grow in the European Union over the last couple of decades.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the tax burden on work – and the report bears this out; but there is no proof and it is not rational to think that this might be a consequence of a reduction in the tax burden on capital: there is no sign of this in the data we have before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now pass on to other points, Mr President, Commissioner. As regards VAT, the report stresses the need to set up a system that applies in full the country-of-origin principle – prioritising the definitive system – on which the Commission documents are, in our view, still evasive. This objective is specified but the timescales and procedures for introducing the country-of-origin regime are not given. The report welcomes certain suggestions for improving the current system, but the introduction of a definitive system is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards excise duties, particularly on alcohol and tobacco, the report reiterates Parliament’s position as already expressed in the Katiforis report. Then in relation to environmental protection, not only is the ‘polluter pays’ principle recognised, but also the fact that taxation is not the only way of implementing this principle. As regards energy taxation, I must stress that, in actual fact, the current competitive distortions and asymmetries in the energy market make it inappropriate now, at least, to propose tax harmonisation for energy products.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of direct taxes, Commissioner, the report hopes that progress towards full implementation of the measures contained in the tax package will be completed as soon as possible and, in particular, that any rules discriminating between residents and non-residents, which leave loopholes for fraud and are incompatible with the single market, will be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the strategy for introducing a consolidated tax base for the Europe-wide activities of companies, the report welcomes the Commission’s decision and proposes the adoption of the Home State Taxation principle, at least temporarily, pending the introduction of the consolidated base. It confirms that determining the rates and levels of taxation should be left to the individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as regards the legal instruments to use, I welcome the effort to introduce soft legislation and therefore self-regulation by the Member States. Lastly, I should like to highlight the principle of Parliamentary codecision in taxation matters and the change to qualified-majority voting for administrative aspects, but not for the definition of rates and the tax base. As the rapporteur, I support the two amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A subject like the taxation of savings certainly ought to be dealt with in such a manner because the field is so sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council have considered at least three hypothetical paths to take in their time, often changing their minds and their strategies. They are: a withholding tax, the exchange of information, and both possibilities together. In the end, they opted for the exchange of information and, after a heated debate in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, this was limited to natural persons. As shadow rapporteur I fought for the exclusion of legal persons from the directive, because a business, whatever form of company status it may have, is obliged to draw up a balance sheet and have it approved. As soon as investments in savings products appear on it, the income they generate must consequently be indicated in the accounts. Therefore, extending the communication requirement to legal persons would be not only superfluous but certainly counterproductive, since it would overburden the communication in a manner that is surely avoidable.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of third countries also needs to be addressed. Should any of them fail to accept the mechanism, it would undermine the whole directive because, if at the time of implementation the conditions in the Member States and third countries were not uniform, it would be highly feasible for substantial amounts of savings to be transferred in real time. The conclusions of the Feira European Council unequivocally state that sufficient reassurances must be obtained from third countries regarding these or equivalent measures so that the adoption and implementation of the directive may be decided upon no later than 31 December 2002, by unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect concerns the Member States that are not subject to the communication requirement for a period of seven years: Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg. These States, however, as laid down in Amendment No 14 to Article 10 paragraph 1, will be required at the end of the transitional period to fully participate in the automatic exchange of information. In the way the directive has been drawn up, all attempts to maintain anonymity have been blocked. It will also be necessary to make it work smoothly and fluently, keeping a watchful eye open for any laundering of dirty money. Without this opportunity to launder money, national and international terrorism will find it hard to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, my Amendment No 6 to Article 3 paragraph 2 (b) also seeks to establish the full personal identity of all contractual relations made prior to the directive as soon as they show any kind of activity. In this regard, it would be desirable to have a European personal data centre to check all major movements of money that may have – or are just suspected of having – connections with international terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Della Vedova very sincerely for his well-balanced proposal. We all know what a difficult area EU tax coordination is. Virtually no one is talking about tax harmonisation any more. At the same time, we also know that tax competition can have very harmful effects on Europe's economies and on the choice of locations for investment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would specifically like to thank Mr Della Vedova for having highlighted the issue of codecision by the European Parliament again in his role as rapporteur, since I believe that in the context of treaty reform and the discussions on a European constitution we also need to consider where the boundaries of national sovereignty lie when it comes to taxation policy. So we also need to adopt new approaches in order to define where it is in the general interest to set cornerstones for tax policy. I therefore believe that the Convention would be well advised to tackle this subject as well and to call for treaty reforms providing for a move away from the unanimity rule and towards the majority rule in EU tax policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course still a very long way from that, if we look at this really excellent paper and the very pragmatic but at the same time very accurate paper by the Commission. The Commission has quite rightly taken stock in a rather sobering way as regards coordination. The situation on value added tax is certainly disappointing, because we are still a long way from applying the country of origin principle. The pragmatic approach adopted by the Commission should therefore be supported, even if we should never lose sight of our ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is hard to reconcile various other areas of tax coordination with a forward-looking approach. I believe that in the case of company taxation we are still a long way from achieving what the Monti Package was at one point attempting to do. In any case, we need to make sure that tax havens are finally abolished and that favourable tax treatment for non-resident legal or natural persons, which distort competition, is finally eliminated. That should be our objective, together with the minimum requirement for uniform definitions in tax law, ranging from the basis of assessment to definitions of profit. I would very much welcome it if we in the European Parliament could agree on a single set of definitions for these arrangements. That would certainly encourage national governments to take a more progressive line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the rapporteur has adopted the amendment I have tabled in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which states that this directive shall be subject to agreement to be reached between the European Union and a number of third countries which have the same duty of notification. This is indeed the thrust of the conclusions which the European Council had reached in Feira. In fact, negotiations in this respect are already under way. It is good therefore that this condition is expressly included in the text of the directive which, so far, strangely enough, had not been the case. In my view, an agreement of this kind involving a number of third countries and so-called independent territories is of great importance in order to guarantee the equal treatment of savings both inside and outside the European Union, to rule out tax avoidance and to prevent considerable flight of capital. I do regret, however, that no amendments have been taken into consideration with regard to the application of the directive to legal entities. This would preclude the placing of significant savings of individuals into the accounts of companies, with the intention of evading this directive, an act which cannot be condoned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for a directive that the Commission submitted to us is meant to be cast into a legislative text. The result is a compromise. The proposal is therefore no longer the result of the right of initiative that is reserved for the Commission. If the Commission is happy to act as the clerk that draws up the Council’s legislation, it could at least have submitted a draft to us that complied better with the legal requirements that we have the right to expect from a legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs for having adopted the majority of my amendments, which I tabled with the aim of ensuring a minimum level of legal security. Our Socialist rapporteur had tried to radicalise this proposal for a directive by moving away from the Feira agreement. In particular he wanted to extend the scope to legal persons and to propose the taxation without distinction of all investment funds. Fortunately these ideas were not taken up. I obviously regret the fact that in Feira, the coexistence model was abandoned. I remain convinced that the automatic exchange of information between Member States on interest payments is a means and not an essential condition for ensuring effective taxation of cross-border interest payments. Withholding tax is, in my opinion, just as valid a solution. It would also be a model that could be adopted by the third countries that are our competitors and with which we need to have reached an agreement in order for them to introduce genuinely equivalent measures before the Directive is applied in the European Union. Clearly, if Switzerland, for example, rejects the exchange of information due to its legitimate commitment to banking secrecy, there can be no question of my country, for example, which clearly declared its support at Feira for the exchange of information, implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the exchange of information will not be the solution that is ultimately chosen. The most effective and least bureaucratic solution would be full withholding tax, which, with a reasonable rate, could even become an own resource of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Surely it is the case that whoever wants to practise good governance should not only draft appropriate laws, but should also ensure that these are complied with. And if we notice that Member States are unable to do this, then we should help them where we can. Incidentally, in Belgium, we are all too familiar with this. We have had monetary union with Luxembourg for years, and it has effectively encouraged cross border payment transactions aimed at avoiding tax on moveable goods. The citizens are all too keen to forget that they have to declare the income derived from moveables from another country to the tax administration of their own country. It can therefore do no harm to give them a helping hand. Ultimately, this can help prevent tax erosion and allows for a more naturally functioning internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always appeared judicious to me to set matters straight in this area, primarily within the internal market, and without necessarily making it subject to agreements with third countries. However, if I have understood the conclusions of Feira correctly, this is a stipulation which the Council does want to put in place. When I read the Commission proposal, it once again fails to state this in the text which normally should reflect the agreement of Feira. This is why I should like to ask the Commissioner once more what, in his opinion, are the advantages and disadvantages of including this stipulation, and I should also like to ask him if he could once again inform us of the current state of affairs in the negotiations involving third countries. Parliament would be interested to know whether these are promising, when they are likely to be concluded and how we should couple the timing of the implementation of this proposal with the results of these negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mr Pérez Royo for his report on the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin with the report of Mr Della Vedova, which I very much welcome. It may help if I recall briefly the Commission's motivation for producing these two communications. Individual Member States retain, quite correctly, responsibility for many aspects of national tax policy. But there is an ongoing demand for an EU tax policy in many areas. A key question is: what degree of harmonisation is appropriate? A high degree of harmonisation is necessary, it seems to the Commission, in the field of indirect taxes. Such taxes can create an immediate obstacle to the free movement of goods and the free supply of services within the internal market. Indeed a certain degree of harmonisation in that area has already taken place. I am very conscious that this Parliament has had its differences with the Commission on the issue of rates of excise duty on tobacco and alcohol – an issue dear to the heart of Mrs Lulling.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, however, that the existing wide rate divergences between Member States constitute a strong incentive for both fraudulent transactions and legitimate cross-border shopping which lead both to distortion of competition and diversion of trade. I am therefore of the opinion that the permanent solution for these problems requires enhanced approximation of rates to a level at which the above effects no longer occur or are brought back to a sustainable level.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is no need to harmonise personal income taxes unless they entail discrimination or double taxation. But there is an intermediate zone of direct taxation of mobile tax bases – in particular the taxation of companies and capital – where the situation is less clear-cut and which may have direct effects on the internal market. The so-called tax package, of which the directive on savings taxation is an important element, seeks to address the potential erosion of tax revenues and eliminate harmful tax competition. But to achieve a balance in European tax policy, attention should also be paid to the concerns of taxpayers, both individuals and companies. That means addressing obstacles that hinder the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty. This is where our communication devoted to company taxation comes in. In that communication we review the tax obstacles faced by companies who operate cross-border in the European Union. We have identified a significant number of those obstacles, which, we must all agree is astonishing, given the fact that it is nearly 10 years since the internal market was established. We have also identified potential solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have examined a number of possible solutions to this problem in the form of both targeted and comprehensive approaches. The latter would, in the longer term, provide companies with a consolidated, corporate tax base for their EU-wide activities. Naturally I am extremely grateful for the support given to this principle by Mr Della Vedova in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">In pursuing the various objectives I have just outlined in relation to taxation at EU level, the Commission will need to employ a variety of methods, including non-legislative mechanisms. Again, I am very grateful for the unqualified support for this policy in Mr Della Vedova's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings. Firstly, I am pleased to note that a substantial number of the proposed amendments correspond to changes agreed by of the ECOFIN Council in the draft directive approved on 13 December 2001, for the purpose of negotiations with third countries. The large measure of agreement between the Council and Parliament on the text of the proposal cannot but strengthen the Community's negotiating position in the discussion with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that the amendments agreed by the Council on 13 December improve and clarify the legal texts, but that they do not substantially change the proposal for a directive. The Commission therefore considers that these amendments do not justify presenting a revised proposal for a directive given the particular time constraints that we are operating under.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs related to the negotiations with third countries and Member States' dependent and associated territories, and more particularly to Parliament's role in these discussions. Parliament may rest assured that I intend to keep Parliament fully informed of these negotiations and that I have no intention whatsoever of undermining Parliament's prerogatives. I fully share the view expressed by Mr Pérez Royo that this proposal has an important international dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly why the Commission asked for and obtained authorisation from the Council to enter into negotiations with the six third countries mentioned in the Faro European Council conclusions. They are: the United States, Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino. The aim of these negotiations is to secure the adoption of measures equivalent to the system applied within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Member States are committed to promoting the adoption of the same measures by their own dependent and associated territories. The discussions with third countries and dependent territories should hopefully be finalised before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that the Faro Agreement provides that these negotiations with third countries and dependent and associated territories should precede the adoption of the directive. The Commission cannot therefore accept amendments that would make the application of the directive, once adopted, dependent on the outcome of such negotiations. There is a risk that such amendments might undermine our negotiating position <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the third countries who quite rightly want to be sure that Member States will implement the directive if they agree to apply equivalent measures.</p>
<p class="contents">On the particular point raised by Mrs Thyssen, the discussions with third countries should precede adoption of the directive. Those agreements are a political condition for adoption of the directive. Therefore we have to live with that.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I once again thank Parliament for its support for the proposed directive on taxational savings. I assure Parliament that I shall keep it informed of developments to the best of my abilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
