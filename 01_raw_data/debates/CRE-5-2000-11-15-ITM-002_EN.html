<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">González Álvarez (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, today we are debating a proposal on general product safety. The Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy considers it to be a generally good proposal. Therefore, there are few amendments. Perhaps the quality of the proposal is due in part to the fact that the Commission consulted over 14 consumer organisations and these pointed out the difficulties there had been in implementing the 1992 directive. I think some of the observations made by the consumer organisations are included in the Commission’s proposal. I shall give one example, one that I know the Council has some difficulties with, but which for Parliament is highly important and we wholly support it: the ban on exporting products deemed unsafe to third countries. And the same has happened with other proposals in the document, which to us seem acceptable. Therefore we have not made too many changes, but there are some which we believe will better safeguard consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This report was approved by a large majority in the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, and I shall therefore stand by the result of the Committee’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals approved in the Committee on the Environment deal with enhancing transparency and consumer information; ensuring the recall of products even when they are already in the hands of consumers; limiting professional confidentiality to the bare essentials; clarifying the definition of a safe product and a dangerous product; including the monitoring of the safety of product installation and maintenance (because sometimes this installation and maintenance may present a risk to consumer safety); including the precautionary principle, a useful principle little used in the European Union (if it were, we would not have problems such as mad cow disease, to be examined this afternoon, the dioxin issue, or other matters relating to genetically modified products); ensuring a certain harmonisation of surveillance and follow-up programmes (it is important that Member States should maintain some equality in these surveillance and follow-up programmes); and in general arranging for consumers to be given information in the language of the country in which they buy the products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, unfortunately we cannot accept some amendments first tabled in the Committee on the Environment and now tabled here, which go against these principles. I shall mention two examples. The first concerns Amendment No 4. It proposes removing a paragraph which simply asks producers and distributors to inform the authorities in the Member States immediately if they learn of a dangerous product. We must not allow this paragraph to be removed. Another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow-up services. We must not allow this paragraph to be removed either.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18, deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom, and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom, whether socialist, popular or green, have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment. They relate to a matter that is very specific to the United Kingdom, that is, charity shops and sales more or less between private individuals. Some of us from other countries do not understand so well this concern of our United Kingdom colleagues, but the amendments were approved in the Committee on the Environment and so I have to explain the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I thank the Commission and the Council for their collaboration in the preparation of this report. I believe the Committee on the Environment has drawn up a report that tries to go more deeply into consumer rights and safety. In view of what has happened in recent years, especially in the food sector, I believe this to be a very important directive and I hope it will be approved by a large proportion of this Parliament, even though, as I said before, certain amendments presented go against the spirit adopted in the Committee on the Environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that a whole raft of amendments to this proposal for a directive are necessary, and regret that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has not adopted these. I am therefore deeply grateful to the PPE Group for having adopted these amendments here today and tabling them for further debate here in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on just two aspects. First, we believe it is wrong that the possible liability of suppliers of services is addressed under this directive on general product safety, because we quite simply consider that issues relating to potential liability of suppliers of services have no place in this directive on general product safety, but should, if necessary, be dealt with in parallel elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about export bans, which have previously been so highly praised. A majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is of the view that there is no legal basis for these. In light of recent experience, notably the European Court of Justice ruling on tobacco advertising, I can really only urge this House to heed the recommendations to plenary of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as the committee responsible for such matters. Otherwise, I regard it as quite possible that the European Court of Justice will make another embarrassing ruling on this issue. For this simple reason we have expressed a different viewpoint, and we can only advise this Chamber, on behalf of a majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to accept Amendments Nos 38 or 41 in particular, as these relate to a weakening of export bans.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I would like to say that if neither of these amendments is adopted, the PPE Group believes that the entire report should be rejected, because we really have had enough of adopting illegal proposals in this place!</p>

If the directive had already been implemented, the accident in Austria might not have happened. This demonstrates just how important legislation is here, and directives in areas as sensitive as product safety need to be implemented as soon as possible. I hope that will happen before 3 May 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal on product safety before us today is a general directive relating in particular to those areas not covered by existing directives. I would like to thank the Commission for adding a very important new point here. I have in mind the presumption of conformity, that is to say that if products comply with European standards they are considered to be safe. I believe that this principle is enormously important for consumer protection because it makes it possible to check at any point whether a product complies with standards or not. In view of this, Amendment No 37, which provides for external certification and for CE declarations to be issued not just by companies, but also by external and impartial agencies, is particularly important for consumer protection, because it would, of course, considerably increase consumers' confidence in such declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Amendment No 14 on the publication of standards in the Official Journal, I naturally have some difficulty with this because the present copyright is with the national standards agencies, who are therefore entitled to royalty payments from the European Union. In addition, there is the question of what the scope of current standards in Europe is and what the scope of European standards would be. I therefore have some very considerable reservations and wish to reject this particular provision.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to export bans, it cannot automatically be assumed that our standards are appropriate throughout the world. There are many countries that have their own regulations and safety standards which meet those countries' needs far better than standards currently in force in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, in many sectors, products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer, with the component parts instead being delivered to dealers. This means that everyone involved in the sales chain who can affect the safety characteristics of a product now bears liability as a manufacturer, so that all dealers who carry out assembly work are classified as manufacturers. We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer's duties under product safety legislation. There are certainly other ways of guaranteeing adequate protection for consumers under civil law, for example, compensation for damages as a consequence of contractual liability. I must say that I was amazed that the Commission's experts have not solved this problem themselves and I trust that the new Commissioner will give this problem some more thought. And I hope that there will not be any problems with the Commission as regards exempting charitable organisations and non-profit making bodies from the provisions of this product safety directive.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to exports, I quite agree that exports should be banned in cases where the Commission has stopped a product from being placed on the market or has ordered a product recall. But a Commission requirement for safety checks cannot be sufficient grounds for bringing whole branches of the export business to a halt. As various honourable Members have already said, at the very least proof that different safety rules apply in the importing country should be accepted. I can only urge the Commission to think again about this problem area, please. We are at first reading. At second or third reading it is necessary to secure the famous 314 votes, and if the report is still in the same form as now that will certainly not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She may occasionally have found the eccentricities of British car boot sales hard to follow but that, too, came within the remit of her personal charity.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive should be welcomed by the whole House and the issue of general product safety and its extension is something which must be commended. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, under the wise guidance of our rapporteur, we passed a series of amendments which, again, my group would commend en bloc to the House today. We are less happy with some of the later ones. We have heard the justifications for them and for the reprise of the industrial arguments which we heard in committee. We remain unpersuaded and we will vote against most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps before the vote, Mrs Lulling or one of her colleagues, will tell us what the exact wording, particularly in the English version, of Amendment No 42, is. We could support it if the wording was 'installation and maintenance' and not 'installation as maintenance'. I am sure this is an error and if this can be confirmed, we will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal includes some extremely valuable general principles including the one which the other side of the Chamber appears to find offensive. That is the principle that we do not export products that we believe are unsafe for our own people in the European Union. Increasingly, as world trade develops, we are faced with this problem and we have to tackle it and not back away on the grounds that somehow the rest of the world does not matter, whether it is the safety of its health, its foodstuffs or the product which we export to it. We have to look now at the links between products and services. The Commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the Commissioner will say more about that when he replies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a word about charity shops and car boot sales and all those other exchanges of donated and individual second-hand goods. The charity shops welcome the general protection of this directive. But they need an exemption from the obligation under Article 2 to provide information that they simply do not have. Our Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 18 bear on that point. I hope it will be possible for the House to support these because it cannot be anybody's intention to see these valuable and usually non-profitable charitable activities effectively driven out by an information provision which should relate to mainline manufacturers and to new or well attested products. Provided the vendor can always inform the buyer of the nature of the goods and the limitations on the information that should be sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as we are concerned, the Commission deserves to be complimented on the way it has handled matters on this occasion. The procedure it followed was first-rate and also very inclusive. This directive gives rise to a certain tension between what can reasonably be expected of producers, on the one hand, and consumer protection on the other. In that respect, I would, in a sense, concur with Mr Lehne when he said that recent statements by the Court indicated that this is a rather nebulous area, when it comes to what the Union can, and cannot, do. In particular, the aspect concerning the definition of exports is something we must look into very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">As matters stand, my group is inclined to support the proposals now on the table, but I would appreciate it if the Commissioner could go into this aspect again in a little more depth. Incidentally, we support the Commission’s proposals concerning the extension of the directive's scope of application to include services, and also the incorporation of migrated products, even though there is certainly still a lot more that could be done in these areas, which will no doubt fall to us in the future. We concur with the rapporteur where he has highlighted the importance of providing consumers with information about the risks, and the need for transparency, especially in the sphere of health and safety. That must indeed be the general principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Two final remarks, the first of which relates specifically to a particular amendment concerning the Commission’s proposal that producers should inform the competent authorities immediately when they discover that a product is dangerous. We believe this to be a very important element. There is a proposal to scrap this idea, one of the considerations being that producers should not have to incriminate themselves, and also in the light of professional secrecy. We feel that the emphasis really must be on consumer protection here, and that a producer who discovers that his product is actually dangerous should not be allowed to sit on his hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a brief question for the Commission about Article 4, which concerns European standards and the question as to whether they must be disclosed. I would be grateful if the Commission could go into this in a little more depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what we have to decide is whether it responds fully to the aims which, eight years ago, it was hoped to achieve through its promulgation or whether it may create further confusion. And this is certainly not the fault of the work carried out by Mrs González Álvarez, who has endeavoured very successfully to improve the legislation under consideration, but is inherent in both the guidelines and parts of the proposal itself. Firstly, in the case in point, the Commission, as the principal author of the legislative process, appears to have appointed itself an administrative authority, although there is no adequate legal and transparent legislative structure to define this new role, even from the point of view of defining its field of operation and monitoring its rapid action decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in view of its potential power to act autonomously as regards the introduction of emergency measures, not to mention the presumably lengthy period which will pass before it is possible to ascertain whether these measures are well-founded, even purely in terms of employment, it should be noted that there is no mention of the damage which would be caused to a company – to its employees in particular – by an erroneous decision. On the other hand, it does provide for a ban on exporting products classed as dangerous, which is certainly evidence of the Union's high level of civilisation, but there is no clear indication of whether this ban is consistent with the procedure known as Prior Informative Concert, laid down, in fact, by international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of liability, in terms of the definition of the word product, product traceability and the inclusion of products used to provide services in this definition, also appears to be open to interpretation and therefore to subjective action. At the same time, we should consider the possible interpretations as a product of the raw materials in the manufacturing processes and the positive implications of this in terms of guaranteeing health and safety at the workplace, although this endeavour is limited by the lack of an appropriate European statistics recording system and by the inconsistencies between legal systems for recognising an occupational illness.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I call upon the Commission to set in motion a coordination project within the framework of existing Community legislation and to make our legislation both more transparent and also genuinely beneficial owing to its certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But do we really need a completely harmonised and uniform standard of protection? It does not seem to me to be a particularly good idea, quite apart from the high cost, stringent regulation and associated red tape. I would have thought it would be better to take more account of subsidiarity. A Danish or German consumer has different safety requirements to a Dutch or Italian consumer. We must give more consideration to this diversity in the directive on general product safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I feel there is insufficient reason for the Commission to produce proposals on the safety of services. By its very nature, the service industry is less suited to this approach. A producer can take a product back, but it would, of course, be rather difficult for a service provider to do so with a service.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that exceptions have been made for shops associated with charitable institutions and non-profit organisations, as well as for articles sold as second-hand goods at markets or car boot sales.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was wondering whether, on closer inspection, Amendment No 14, tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has been formulated correctly. It does not seem to me to be a problem if an agreement is reached between a standardisation body and the government, which makes European standards freely accessible to the public. After all, that is not the same as the Commission publishing the European standards. I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you Mother Europe for taking care of your children! Or should I say, rather, thank you Father Byrne! Thank you because all the safety directives aim to preserve the well-being of our European citizens, from minors, from children right up to the elderly. This is certainly positive. However, I do recall a substantial discussion which I had with my daughter, Elisabetta, when she was nine years old and wanted to be allowed to go out on her own. I told her that she could not go out unaccompanied because it was dangerous. Then, some years later, when I allowed my second daughter, who is six or seven years younger, to go out on her own, Elisabetta protested: "But Daddy, you never let me go out on my own and here you are, letting my sister out alone, and she is younger than I was!" In effect, a good father must indeed take into account the safety of his children, but he must also realise that they cannot be wrapped in cotton wool. They have to learn to be independent.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of all this? The point is that all the safety directives must be balanced. A balance must be achieved. We must indeed be safe but we must not stifle production, in this case, which has to be free. Most importantly – and here I am addressing the Council representative – how can any safety directives be effectively implemented if the Council refuses to endorse the directive on safety inspections and controls? The outcome will be the same as in the mad cow affair: thousands of safety measures leading, regrettably, to the slaughter of millions of animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Socialists in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy support the Commission’s initiative to clarify procedures for informing the public and for recalling products that are deemed to be dangerous, and for extending this responsibility to distributors and producers of services to the extent they are involved. These producers and distributors must unequivocally accept the consequences of the foreseeable risks inherent in their products, from the installation of equipment to its maintenance. They are also responsible for informing the authorities and consumers and for fair compensation for damages. Recalling products in a situation of risk should not be done as a last resort but must begin as soon as there are reasonable grounds for taking this course of action in the light of recent scientific advances.</p>
<p class="contents">Community standardisation must be based on appropriate scientific knowledge and we must therefore foster cooperation between Member States in researching the safety of products in general and of high-risk groups in particular, such as children, the elderly, new youth cultures, new lifestyles and people with a history of illness. The reliability of product safety and after-sale care represent added value for a "made in Europe" label at a particularly difficult and crucial time. Any measures that increase confidence and mean that European products are manufactured and distributed with respect for workers’ health, for social rights, for the environment, for fair competition and with rigorous safety requirements are to be welcomed. Any product that does not match up to this standard must be withdrawn and appropriately disposed of, because products that we would not wish for ourselves should not be exported to more disadvantaged countries either. I hope that this directive will help to respond, in part, to the European public's increasing concerns about consumer safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the present debate is to review the experience we have gained with the existing directive, to incorporate that experience and to eliminate any shortcomings. I rather doubt whether we have adequately achieved that.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certainly complex legal issues here. The scope of the directive in relation to the wide variety of national and Community product legislation needs to be defined, as that legislation, too, covers the same safety ground. We need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways. The possibility of having a product's compliance with regulations certified by an external agency would certainly be very helpful in this case and would ensure a clearer and more logical approach. However, it would have been better to have an EU regulation providing for a general European system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the food sector, for example, there are also numerous rules and regulations which are currently being amended and revised as a result of proposed EU regulations and I think this will help us to reach a high standard of safety. In other sectors, this directive has been extended to other fields of application. The inclusion of service-related products will lead to dealers and the craft sector increasingly being burdened with obligations which are actually the responsibility of the manufacturer. Elsewhere, we are calling on the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services, so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now, instead of waiting for the Commission's proposal, since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few more words about export issues. On the one hand we are demanding widely varying safety standards and like Mr Blokland are calling for national and regional needs to be taken into account, and on the other we want to impose our national provisions on countries we export to. I feel that this means there is a fundamental contradiction in the directive's approach, which we cannot support as it is proposed here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lack of confidence in the possibility of ensuring food safety, for example, is spreading like wildfire and, when all is said and done, obscures the Union's positive work in this sector. But we are going to discuss this today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is therefore important to emphasise the political value of the directive upon which we are about to vote. Thanks to the Commission's sound proposal, further improved by Mrs González Álvarez's work, the text that we are examining today at last brings good news for consumers, to which, moreover, the non-governmental organisations which represent them bear witness. The laws on product safety, in particular the safety of those products which have hitherto escaped regulation by the vertical legislation already governing the matter, is being improved, consolidated and made more transparent. A great deal of effort has been made to better define the interaction between vertical laws on certain categories of products and this new horizontal directive, so as to definitely achieve a satisfactory result.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to stress the importance of the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which increase transparency towards the end consumer and apportion responsibility to distributors as well as producers in the event of products deemed dangerous being withdrawn from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope of seeing the final line taken by the rapporteur endorsed and declaring my support for her regarding the amendments which are to be put to the vote in plenary, I trust that this directive will rapidly continue through the procedures so that the European citizens can be provided with confirmation of the Union's undertaking to preserve their safety as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – First of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, the draftsmen, Mr Rübig and Mr Lehne, and the respective committees for their very comprehensive report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Commission proposal is in response to the numerous problems related to the health and safety of consumers which have occurred recently. Although the review and revision of the directive are formally required by the directive itself, this coincides with the reinforced commitment by the Commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The revised directive will be of relevance for food safety for only a limited period of time but it will, in the long term, improve the possibilities for dealing with non-food product safety problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would only say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal. The idea behind the directive is simple: that only safe products are placed on the market. This means European products as well as imported products. The two key objectives of the general products safety directive are: ensuring a high and consistent level of protection for consumer health and safety throughout Europe and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We had extensive consultations with stakeholders – as the rapporteur has acknowledged – on implementation of the present directive, which brought to light certain weaknesses which we are now trying to correct.</p>
<p class="contents">We first clarify the scope of the directive. This directive is meant to provide good and consistent assurances of the safety of products for consumers. It is also meant to fill possible gaps in sectoral legislation, for instance, market surveillance or emergency procedures that are rarely provided for in specific legislation. However, it does not apply when specific sectoral legislation covering the same aspect applies. This also means that when new sectoral legislation is devised it supersedes the corresponding provisions of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the foodstuffs area – as you well know – when we have a food authority, the authority itself should provide a notification system which will take over from the general product safety provisions. We wanted to make sure that the directive gave the best coverage possible to products used by consumers. This also means products which have migrated from the professional field to personal use: for instance, laser pointers; and, secondly, products which are used to provide a service.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to have a more efficient system. This implies additional obligations for producers and distributors to provide information. The present situation is less than ideal. It is incredible, for example, that authorities in our Member States are sometimes informed by the US authorities that a certain European product is dangerous. The notification is compulsory in the United States but not, so far, in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, law is no good if it is not applied properly. Member States will now be required to strengthen the tasks of competent surveillance authorities. They will be required to establish sanctions. They will have to develop links with other Member States as well; in particular, through a network of enforcement authorities of Member States. This is also extremely important from an industry point of view in order to make sure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors and especially with imported products.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvement of Rapex (the rapid alert system operated by the Commission) is also necessary. The scope of Rapex is extended to include voluntary measures taken by industry to withdraw a product. The practical operation of the system will be improved. We now also provide for the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular to the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for emergency measures at Community level so that we can take rapid action following the advice of a regulatory committee. We have now introduced an export ban for products withdrawn at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is the question of improved transparency. Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what is happening. Nothing undermines consumer confidence more than a belief that something is going on that they do not know about. We believe that, in line with the general policy of the Commission, citizens have the right to know which real dangers they are exposed to and the measures taken to prevent that. The limitation to this is professional secrecy as defined in Article 287 of the Treaty, except when there are overriding public health reasons. I expect that exception will be drawn and interpreted narrowly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the report of Mrs González Álvarez endorses the main principles of the Commission proposal. Many of the proposed amendments of the report are an improvement on the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to address first the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree. Firstly, Amendments Nos 1, 8 and 18 propose to exempt second-hand goods sold by charity shops and non-profit organisations, private persons, flea markets and car boot sales, as Mr Whitehead has said, from the obligation to provide information and documentation on product risk and product origin. The obligations of distributors, which have been a part of the directive since 1992, are formulated in a very generic and flexible way.</p>
<p class="contents">The only new requirement is that distributors, within the limits of their respective activities, are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tracing the origin of products. This does not imply that distributors should actively inquire about the origin of a product, but just that they should not destroy identification of the product and/or manufacturer and keep trace of any useful information available on the product origin.</p>
<p class="contents">This new requirement does not imply any substantial additional responsibility in the case of these kinds of shops. Charity shops normally receive, as a gift, single used products which they in turn sell to consumers. The nature of their trade is such that they could not be required to play a proactive part in product tracing. In addition, the interest in terms of market surveillance of tracing the origin of single second-hand defective products is simply non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, there is already a lot of flexibility in the requirements of the directive on distributors. These requirements can be applied to these kinds of shops in a way compatible with the nature of their activities. However, to meet the concerns raised and in order to further clarify the situation we could consider including in the recital dealing with this article a statement that it may prove impossible to provide the competent authorities with information and documentation on the possible risks and origin of the product in the case of isolated used objects donated by private individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 3 proposes a deletion of part of the motivation for having clear conditions in the annex of the directive for the duty of business to inform the authorities about dangers. This motivation is needed in order to prevent excessive bureaucracy. Thirdly, Amendment No 4 proposes adding, in a preamble, a requirement that Member States draw up factual reports with the cooperation of competent and independent public or private institutions. To require Member States to engage external institutions for this runs counter to subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 29 require the Commission to consider approaches or submit a proposal relating to the safety of services in Amendment No 29 before a specified date. The Commission is in fact already analysing and considering this issue, but it would go too far against the Commission's right of initiative to introduce this in the directive in such a prescriptive way.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 proposes certain changes in the references to paragraphs. The first part is acceptable to the Commission, but it is not common practice in Community legal texts to explain the content of articles referred to, as proposed. To replace the word "producer" with "supplier", as proposed in Amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, as there is no definition of supplier in the directive. The definition of producer already covers suppliers whose activities may affect the safety properties of the product.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13 proposes adding a reference to the precautionary principle in the general obligation for producers to place only safe products on the market. The precautionary principle is a general principle of risk management by the competent authorities and cannot be enforced as such as a direct obligation on producers. The Commission does, however, share the view that the principle is important as a background for the revision of the directive, and a reference to this principle could therefore be made in the first recital of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the idea of publishing a full text of the European standards in the Official Journal, as proposed in Amendments Nos 14 and 16, is understandable, it would require fundamental changes in the relationship between the Community and the European standardisation organisations, probably implying higher levels of subsidies from the Community budget. The reason for this is that the standardisation organisations own the standards and that most of them finance part of their activities through the sale of the standards. This issue, with implications for most product-related Community legislation, cannot, therefore, be dealt with in the context of the current revision of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 proposes harmonisation of Member States' monitoring approaches on the basis of guidelines prepared by the Commission and the consultative committee. Although the Commission is in favour of cooperation and common principles, the proposed wording runs counter to subsidiarity. To require Member States to take measures also in cases when business has already taken satisfactory measures to prevent a risk, which would be the consequence of the second part of Amendment No 21, is not acceptable. This would also run counter to the objective of encouraging business to take proactive measures on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 23 proposes the introduction in the directive of provisions on compensation in respect of damage. These are civil law aspects, regulated by the directive on product liability, and should not, therefore, be dealt with here.</p>
<p class="contents">A requirement that the product safety network should be established within a specified time-frame is proposed in Amendment No 24. Although the Commission is in favour of quickly establishing a network, this has to be agreed between the Member States. It is therefore not realistic to set a time-frame.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part of Amendment No 27 proposes that only information related to the risks that have been established should be made available to the public. This is not acceptable, as consumers should also have a right to obtain information on on-going investigations – provided that this information is not covered by professional secrecy in the manner that I described earlier and drawn narrowly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 28 proposes that the Commission should submit a report on the implementation of the directive every second year instead of every three years. Although the Commission has sympathy for this idea, this cannot be done within the current limitations of the resources of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot agree with most of the additional amendments proposed for the plenary session. Allow me to explain first the Commission's position on the amendments to which we cannot agree. Amendments Nos 30, 32, 42 and the main part of Amendment No 33 propose rewordings of the existing text of the directive which is not subject to revision. No problems have been reported to the Commission with the existing wordings and the changes would weaken the provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 36 proposes that services directly associated with the product should be excluded except when provided by the original producer. The discussions in Council go in the direction of dealing with the services within the definition of product which is, in fact, acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 43 would totally exclude the application of this directive to products regulated by specific legislation. This is not acceptable, as these directives often lack provisions on market surveillance, notification systems and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">A possibility of proving that a product conforms to the requirements through external certification is proposed in Amendment No 37. Such certification can always be used for providing evidence but cannot, in itself, be regarded as foolproof.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 38 proposes limiting the time period for emergency decisions to six months which is, in most cases, not sufficient for adopting permanent measures. It also proposes an exemption from the export ban when the producer can show that the safety requirements of the receiving State are complied with. This is not acceptable as products judged at Community level as posing serious risks and requiring rapid intervention should not be exported. The amendment also proposes that the possibilities for parties to submit their views on a Community measure taken should be without prejudice to domestic remedies. As this is not any type of appeal procedure, this seems unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Amendment No 41 proposes that the export ban should not apply when a product has been banned while carrying out further checks. This is a period during which there are real dangers of exports taking place. If the checks confirm that the product is safe, the ban will automatically be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 39 and 44 propose that information on dangerous products should only be available to the public once a banning or withdrawal decision has been issued and that exchange of information protected by professional secrecy should not be possible between market surveillance authorities. As the consumer should also have the right to information about risks not yet firmly established, including in cases when the measure taken is not a ban or withdrawal, this is not acceptable either. In addition, effective market surveillance cannot be carried out under the proposed limitations regarding confidential information.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 40 proposes a deletion of the duty for business to notify the authorities about dangerous products they place on the market. That is not acceptable as this is a key improvement in comparison to the existing directive. Still on the notification obligation, we believe that to use the term "ascertain" instead of "conclude" for triggering the moment when information is to be notified, as proposed in the first part of Amendment No 34, will create more uncertainty than clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Having extensively explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 43 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal. In the case of some of these amendments, however, in particular Amendments Nos 2, 15, 22, 25, 31 and the second part of Amendment No 27, further editorial changes might improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to thank again Mrs González Álvarez for the excellent report which can be supported by the Commission to a large extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
