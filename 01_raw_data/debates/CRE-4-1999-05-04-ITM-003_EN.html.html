<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Prodi, </span>  <span class="italic">nominee for President of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time in just under a month that I have been given the opportunity to address you. Out of regard for the fairly formal style of these meetings – a style I feel is totally appropriate – I must return to the speech I made on 13 April, when I spoke of a vision for the European project, and promised my commitment, and that of the next Commission, to embarking on a period of major reforms and change. Today I shall concentrate on some of the questions that are at the top of the European political agenda. The meeting with the Heads of State and Government on 14 April revealed that there is a definite desire to continue working towards a comprehensive reform of the Commission and, at the same time, to strengthen our common policies, particularly in relation to the common foreign and security policy and Europe's profile on the international stage; policies to create an area of freedom, security and justice within the European Union; and policies to stimulate economic growth in Europe and to combat unemployment. I shall confine myself to these three questions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problems which must be addressed regarding the reshaping of the role of the Commission: firstly, the definition of the institutional role of the Commission in relation to the Council and Parliament; and secondly, a clearer definition of the relationship between politics and administration in the workings of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that increasing the efficiency and accountability of the Commission in future largely depends on greatly reducing the grey areas which currently tend to blur the demarcation lines of autonomy and responsibility between those performing more political tasks and those more involved with administration. The most important way to make this division more transparent is to increase the Commission's scope for political involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">While respecting the Treaties and the powers of Parliament and the Council, the Commission needs to produce a major political programme, focusing above all on certain key priorities. Defining priorities is one of the main tasks of politics and must be the direct responsibility of the President and the Commissioners as a team. Over the last few days, I have been considering organisational methods of improving coordination and cooperation between the team of Commissioners, and how the Commission can operate efficiently as a unit with a structure consisting of 20 members. Thus far I have only come up with partial solutions, and these questions deserve further consideration. However, I believe that some solutions can be tried out, while respecting the letter of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of this project will depend to a great extent on the professional and political attributes of the individual Commissioners and their attitude to teamwork. Secondly, the Vice‐Presidents could coordinate strategic areas for the Commission's activities. Lastly, I believe that there should be an examination of the idea of creating departments dealing with portfolios which require integration and cooperation, entrusting the Commissioners responsible for these areas with the task of increasing coordination. The Commission I have in mind will have the powers, the political awareness and the will to work as a team, to improve efficiency and transparency and to express a strong political programme. Once we have increased the Commission team's capacity to provide political direction, we will be able to set about increasing the transparency, efficiency and accountability of their departments, as required by the Treaty of Amsterdam and demanded by European public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">In my view, one of the reasons for the development of grey areas between technical and political spheres lies in the role assumed by the Cabinets. The Cabinets need to acquire a more markedly supranational structure and must simply serve as an instrument supporting the policies developed by the President and the Commissioners. The task of implementation must be left to the departments, i.e. the Secretary‐General and the Directorates‐General, which need a greater degree of autonomy and increased responsibility. Political responsibility must lie with the team of Commissioners and, ultimately, with the President, but administrative responsibility must lie with the Directors‐General in a system where areas of autonomy are clearly defined, as are methods and instruments for exercising control. I am aware that this Parliament has voiced a feeling which is widespread among the people of Europe and expects significant steps to be taken in this direction. I also know that a people's Europe is built on transparency and the opening‐up of the institutions, and I will make these areas top priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming years, there will increasingly be an international dimension to the activities of the European Union. In my view, there are three principal and most pressing reasons for raising the profile of the European presence in the world. Firstly, the giant strides made towards economic and monetary integration have introduced a major actor to the international stage – the euro – and brought with it a major responsibility for ensuring monetary stability and stimulating growth after the financial crises of recent years. As with more typically political questions, where the transatlantic axis is crucial, I believe that a stronger Europe is useful for a fairer and more sustainable division of tasks between the two sides of the Atlantic. It also creates a ‘dual motor" model, which is certainly more stable than a system based on a single currency. A redistribution of the load, however, means that alterations will have to be made to the institutional and financial structure. While international monetary stability is a basic prerequisite for a healthy economy, the real agent for growth will be a further round of liberalisation of international trade under the World Trade Organisation, which is an area where the European Commission has key powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason for enhancing the international dimension of the EU's activities is born of the need to restore equilibrium to the development of Europe as an economic entity by means of Europe as a political entity. This is the explanation behind the ‘Vienna strategy for Europe", which was approved by the Council last December. In the future, a new design for the institutions, mapped out at a new Conference, will be needed to exploit to the full concerted efforts in the field of defence, possibly based on the gradual and progressive model which has already been used for monetary union. A common defence of the European Union will be a basic condition for maintaining peace and stability, as was recently repeated at the Washington NATO summit. Europe must be able to do its share.</p>
<p class="contents">The first challenge has already been embarked upon with the initiation of the EU enlargement process. Apart from turning over the unhappy page in European history of the Iron Curtain, enlargement raises immediate political questions by shifting the Union's centre of gravity to the East, thereby underlining the importance of relations with Russia, which will provide a yardstick for the success of any future common foreign and security policy. The greatest challenge will be to satisfy Europe's civil and commercial vocation in the face of contact with diverse and heterogeneous cultures to the south and south‐east. This can be achieved only by discarding the nineteenth‐century model of the closed State, with its inviolable borders, and embracing the more modern and liberal notion of an open society, of ‘porous" frontiers and common interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final reason for fulfilling Europe's political calling swiftly is unfortunately there for all to see. In the former Yugoslavia, ethnic hatred and tyranny have triumphed over arguments for growth and economic integration. However painful, the involvement of the international community is necessary because, at least in the part of Europe which has signed up to standards of behaviour set out in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, the systematic use of an army against a civilian population is intolerable and must be severely punished. But the Union's role in the former Yugoslavia goes beyond finding a solution to the current military crisis. Europe can offer greater prospects to the parties involved in the conflict. There is a need for such prospects, for if we limit ourselves to local identities, we risk the carnage that ensues when every metre of land is vital, whereas if we create the model of differences between peoples and nations within a Europe which is more integrated and open, the differences lose their importance and the possibility of successfully living together grows.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I have already touched on the need for a method for resolving all the conflicts of the former Yugoslavia within a single and broader framework, and I have evoked the idea of a plan to stabilise the whole region completely and permanently in a European context. I wonder whether it is not necessary to convene a major international conference on the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">This would not mean reneging on the Dayton or Rambouillet Agreements, which are based on the incontrovertible principles of the London Conference. The idea would be to strengthen the spirit of those agreements and provide them with a definitive framework for the whole region. I think that the position and vocation of the European Union mean that it is well placed to play a key role in this process, especially once the arms and the violence give way to reason and the Yugoslav Federation returns to the family of European nations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Another key area for European policy in the coming years will be internal security. On 14 October 1999, at an extraordinary meeting in Tampere, the European Council – as agreed with Parliament – will have to set out the objectives for the plan for an area of freedom, security and justice, which will become the European Union's legislative programme for the next five years, completing the first action plan set out in Vienna last December.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the method, I believe it is essential for there to be a close synergy between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, national governments and parliaments, and the representatives of society as a whole. As to the substance, I consider the essential objective to be the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, which is one of the fundamental objectives set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam for the development of the Union and for the implementation of and commitment to basic rights, European citizenship and the fight against all forms of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, I share the views expressed by the European Parliament in its resolution of 13 April. The Treaty of Amsterdam provides us with the instruments to respond to the ever louder calls for security and justice in the light of Europe's political, economic and social development of the last ten years. This means we must all embrace the objective of an area of freedom, security and justice as a concrete expression of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe has been able to give up national sovereignty in relation to the single currency and common external borders, it must – and surely can – meet the challenge of developing a common sword to maintain its security and common scales of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be proud that in the last few months we have succeeded in developing the shared management of European monetary policy, but this is a success with enormous implications for our activities which we must understand.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, we believed that the introduction of the euro would galvanise the European cycle, which would rapidly wipe out national public deficits. The recovery would also have created an environment more favourable to the implementation of further genuine policies for the convergence of the structure of markets, which it is the Commission's task to stimulate.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth in the European economy is currently slowing down. Europe is involved in a war, the grave consequences of which will be felt at its borders for many years to come. Europe must make the necessary structural reforms to its markets in goods and production factors which are needed because there are no federal public accounts. Last but not least, Europe is grappling with the threat of the disenchantment of European citizens following the initial enthusiasm for the euro. We need tangible successes on the employment front to reassure the people of Europe that the euro and Europe are synonymous with prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">All the national governments are aware that genuine convergence must be attained by means of the total liberalisation of the markets in goods and services and complete integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will have to lend fresh impetus to this process to reduce differences remaining in the implementation of directives and to request intervention where the power of the State is still significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Taxation is a key issue when it comes to creating a truly European market. Further steps can be taken with regard to indirect taxation, particularly in relation to the emission of pollutants, which some countries have already started introducing to implement the Kyoto Agreement. Coordination is needed to ensure that production is not unfairly hampered in countries which are more active with regard to the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules of conduct being adopted by the Member States with regard to the taxation of company and financial profits are extremely important and deserve priority.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic cycle, all the options currently offered by the stability pact and the programmes presented by the Member States will need to be exhausted to sustain demand within Europe. In this light it will be advisable to implement the Agenda 2000 agreements swiftly, studying, where necessary, appropriate methods of advancing funds for multiannual programmes of public investment in transnational projects.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget to equip ourselves with instruments to allow the EMU to intervene to counter any effects of cyclical crises.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad economic policy guidelines set out by the Commission on 30 March outline medium‐term action, and national governments are moving into line. I must say that I derive great satisfaction from seeing that there are an increasing number of bilateral declarations concerning the conduct of employment policies, with a view to preparing the pact for employment for the forthcoming Cologne summit. These are important seeds of coordination. Not everyone shares the same vision, but this plurality presents the challenge and the opportunity to choose the best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also satisfying to note that various countries are increasingly prepared to review the high level of taxation and expenditure. The burden of taxation as a percentage of GDP will increasingly be reduced in the future, and the Member States should move together in this direction, each encouraging the other. As taxation will have to be reduced without endangering stability programmes, we will need to decide which areas of current expenditure will have to be limited as a percentage of GDP. Given the differing budget structures and public deficits, suggestions will not be made with one voice, but it is easy to imagine that they will also involve the rates of growth of expenditure on social provision.</p>
<p class="contents">To encourage the mobility of labour and come close to a common method of combining efficiency and solidarity, interventions in social expenditure will at least need to be based on common principles, such as greater reliance on insurance for social services. Here too, the Commission will have to act to safeguard the interests of future generations, forcing governments to take timely action to resolve potential conflicts between the generations resulting from an ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">To make any real impact on the unemployment problem and the future of forthcoming generations, macro‐economic policies must be backed up by an equally far‐sighted range of micro‐economic measures. This range of measures must above all include an extra special effort in the area of training for all types of human resources; stepping up investment in research and development; and the development of the information society. The specialised production of Member States and the relative scarcity of new dynamic sectors are among the many causes of unemployment. Although the performance of most of the scientific and technological production indicators is similar to the United States, the production structure in the more innovative and high‐technology areas is considerably weaker in Europe than it is in the United States. This may be accounted for by the inadequate capacity to transform scientific and technological knowledge into business opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Europe has a long way to go, it is not starting from scratch. It has already made a start. Admittedly, a strong collective effort will be needed in the area of innovation. But the Community has several forms of experience behind it which could serve as an example and be a help in building the future. They come under six main headings. First of all, the Erasmus programme, now incorporated in Socrates, is one of the more significant experiences: young people have learned to travel about the European Union; it has brought together many cultural traditions which give life to the old world; it enhances their training and employability. Since 1987 it has benefited 500 000 students. It might be worth extending the programme beyond the student world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of European policies supporting technological progress, there are also some positive signs which should be encouraged: I am referring above all to the fifth framework programme, aimed at consolidating links between research and small and medium‐sized businesses. This in turn gives rise to a third line of action: in the years ahead we must give substance to the sustainable development option, always doing more to ensure that the quality of the environment is one of the hallmarks of the European social and economic model and a positive factor for innovation. In this context, some objectives should be pursued with special vigour. Besides the taxation problem referred to above, we must promote more comprehensive harmonisation of national legislation, more integration of the environment policy and other European policies – especially agricultural policy and incentives for industrial innovation and infrastructure programmes – and make a determined effort to clean up our cities and pursue a policy of sustainable development there, for they are the foundations of the European ideal.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has already opted for sustainable development; it is clearly indicated in the Treaty of Amsterdam and Agenda 2000 and confirmed by the European Council in Cardiff and Vienna. Care for the quality of the environment is a resource which we should draw on and defend to develop the competitiveness of our economy, and one of the most concrete and serious ways there are to safeguard our children's heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth positive sign is given by the changes in the rules governing economic life: not only are we experiencing a single market with freedom of movement of goods, services, persons and capital, but we have a common currency, and Europe today is a more competitive economic system. In this connection, I would recall the 1989 regulation on mergers and the subsequent – severe – anti‐trust court rulings to which it gave rise, the rules on state aid for firms, the impetus for liberalisation and privatisation. This is why I am emphasising how changes in the rules have been factors for change, together with technological progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The gradual process of liberalising markets is accompanied by stronger consumer protection instruments. By expressing their views, consumers will take their rightful place in the interplay between business and the regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">A fifth positive sign is given by the growing role played by European stock markets in allocating resources. The role of merchant banks and suppliers of venture capital in the development of American firms and advanced technology is rightly underlined by observers. Significant changes are taking place in Europe today, where the new pan‐European markets of hi‐tech and high‐growth small businesses are gradually consolidating. This trend is continuing with increasing vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many mergers and acquisitions have taken place in European industry and finance, particularly since the second half of 1998. These changes should be accompanied by new legal instruments, beginning with the European Company Statute. Establishment of a European company will enable firms in the Member States to set up a holding company or branch in other Member States without being subject to the legal and practical constraints of 15 national systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, by the time my term of office ends, in 2005, the single currency will have been a reality in people's pockets for more than three years; the completion of the last stage of the Uruguay Round will have further opened up our economy to international trade; national monopolies will to a large extent have disappeared; there will be greater competition, not least in financial and other services, and European consumers will already have reaped the fruits in many different respects. The Union will – I hope – have gained new members and will be poised to launch the next stage of enlargement to include countries that have already begun to integrate their economies with ours. The successes in each of these areas will contribute to success in others, but it is in the coming 18 months to two years that we must take the first steps on the road to developing this potential, introducing reforms in national markets and the European institutions, in preparation for enlargement. But even if we succeed in this, many of the results we hope for would be put at risk if the Union was unable, over the next three or four months, to bring peace to the entire geographical region of Europe. We should already be thinking of the post‐war settlement, of ways of applying to the Balkans the formula that has enabled the countries of the EU to resolve major and minor problems by means of ever greater economic integration. The price to be paid by those responsible for the war will be the defeat of their plan for physical and cultural separation. This will show the population of the Balkans that democracy, prosperity and local autonomy are not irreconcilable, but will be boosted by the integration of a region that – regrettably – has no experience of integration in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a continent with a history of bloody wars and rivalries between nations. But we have seen a new consciousness emerge over time, which has formed the basis for the integration and the genuine and lasting peace of the past 50 years. This consciousness, which has its origins in humanism and Christianity, has liberated Europeans and opened the way to tolerance and diversity. The great successes of the European Union are founded on the development of the religious ideal, scientific enlightenment, the industrial revolution, economic liberalism and the advent of the welfare state democracy. Only by broadening our institutions and securing an area of peace on the European continent will we be able to safeguard what we have achieved so far and bring it to fruition.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the appointment of a new European Commission has always been an act of great consequence in European politics. This time, however, the process is taking place under particularly unusual conditions. Firstly, following the resignation of the previous Commission, we need to remedy negative developments and irregularities and regain the confidence that has been lost. Secondly, we need to act quickly to put an end to the crisis and return to normality. Thirdly, for the first time since it entered into force a few days ago on 1 May, the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam are now applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunities for deep‐seated reform that are presented by this new beginning can only be exploited fully if the three institutions involved – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – work closely together on a basis of trust. The conditions for this are in place, as we will see today.</p>
<p class="contents">The nomination procedure is underway and could be concluded before the summer break. The nomination of Romano Prodi at the extraordinary European Council in Berlin was the first step, and in doing so the Heads of State and Government showed the European Union"s ability to act and its determination to resolve the crisis quickly and convincingly. They agreed on a figure who meets the requirements of this difficult office as almost no other could. Romano Prodi is a European of conviction, a proven and successful economic and political reformer, and an experienced politician in administrative matters. He also brings to the post the necessary close relationship with the people and, after hearing his speech, I would say that he is a candidate who combines vision, a sense of reality, pragmatism and a clear awareness of what is needed. He is also a candidate who should live up to the expectations of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If you, the Members of the European Parliament, follow the proposal of the Heads of State and Government and vote in favour of Mr Prodi"s appointment in Thursday"s vote, the next step will be for the governments to name, in agreement with the President‐designate, the people they intend to nominate as members of the Commission. The resulting proposal for the whole College will then be presented to the newly‐elected Parliament as soon as it assembles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to the German Presidency that all Member States apply the very strictest standards when it comes to forming the new Commission. We want a reforming Commission, a Commission made up of Europeans of conviction and convincing Europeans; we want a Commission made up of men and women who are distinguished by their ability, experience, leadership skills and personal integrity. I am sure that we all hope the necessary hearings can be concluded in time for us to secure Parliament"s approval in July and proceed with the formal appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">All those involved – Parliament, Council and Commission – have a common interest in ensuring that the new Commission is formed and the appointments confirmed quickly. For this reason I firmly believe that, if we wish to do so, we can keep to the timetable that I have outlined. The people of Europe expect this of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It was intended from the outset – and this was confirmed by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin – that the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam would be applied to the appointment procedure. The Treaty has now entered into force and this means above all that the future Commission President and the European Parliament have a greater role in the appointment of the Commission. The intention was to strengthen the overall position of the Commission President and to underline this by giving Parliament a separate vote on the appointment. The current situation underlines the importance of the reforms introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which make the whole procedure more transparent and legitimate. We should not lose sight of this aspect in applying the provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The formation of the new Commission gives us the opportunity now to tackle the problems which played a part in the crisis and ultimately the resignation of the current Commission. The first priority will be the internal reforms which the Commission must undertake and – there are already very specific documents on this – rapidly implement by itself. Romano Prodi presented some of his own ideas to the Heads of State and Government at their informal meeting in Brussels on 14 April, and this exchange of views is to be continued at the European Council in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. In this context the programme of reform presented by President Santer – ’The Commission of Tomorrow", including the components MAP 2000 and SEM 2000 – is of particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals aim to modernise administration and personnel policy, solve the problems in the area of the budget, financial control and fraud prevention, and also to reform financial management by means of more efficient financial control. All in all, we need to establish clear political priorities, to bring Commission structures into line with future tasks, and we need greater decentralisation, including in terms of the administration of appropriations. We also need to rationalise and improve the efficiency of the Commission"s work, and I believe that this should include adopting codes of conduct for Commissioners and officials. The Council and the European Parliament must also help to remedy negative developments and irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want a Commission that has strength, the ability to act and integrity, we must also provide it with the resources it needs to deal with its new tasks, for example in the area of enlargement or humanitarian missions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We must also think about the reforms we would need in order to amend the Treaties. The EC Treaty provides only for the possibility of a collective motion of censure against the Commission by the European Parliament. Our most recent experiences have shown us that the possibility of dismissing individual Commissioners – whether on the initiative of the Commission President, Parliament or the Council – should certainly now be examined in cooperation with the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">National regulations could serve as a basis here.</p>
<p class="contents">The events surrounding the resignation of the Commission have shown that a truly European public is beginning to develop. The people of Europe have a new‐found need to know what is happening in Brussels and here in Strasbourg, and certainly to follow it more closely. The public is now paying greater attention to all things European, things which were hitherto regarded as being the preserve of experts on Europe. I consider this to be a positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context more questions are being asked about the democratic legitimacy and control of the European institutions. There are various reasons for this. The EU has gradually grown in importance and its spheres of activity have expanded; furthermore, many more decisions are being made which directly affect the public and their lives. These decisions increasingly involve majority voting, so that individual Member States can be bound against their will. However, some of the decision‐making procedures are very complicated and difficult to understand. The institutional balance between Parliament, Council and Commission that is provided for in the Treaties has in practice shifted to some degree. So the question is how we can strengthen democratic control in practice, guarantee legitimacy and increase transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned the reforms that could and must be carried out in the Commission. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, its supervisory rights are increased by the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is granted important new rights and powers in the areas of legislation, CFSP financing and the appointment of the Commission. However, the European Parliament still needs to be strengthened further.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The more capable of action the Union becomes, the stronger the democratic legitimacy of its actions and decisions must be.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">This means that whenever the Council passes legislation by a majority vote – and we want to make majority voting the rule – the European Parliament must have an equal say and equal weight in the decision‐making.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is currently facing some enormous challenges: the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, enlargement negotiations, the expansion of the euro zone, the WTO round of negotiations, improvement of common policy in the field of justice and home affairs, and in particular strengthening the Union"s profile in foreign affairs. In order to cope with these tasks we need a strong Commission that is capable of action and has integrity; we must now work together to ensure that the conditions for this are in place.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Green </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I and the House have listened extremely carefully this morning to Mr Prodi's opening statement. I thank him very much for the thoughtful and intelligent approach he took to the opening of this debate. That we are here today looking at the ratification of a new President of the Commission, six months before it was due according to the timetable, is a reflection of the changing roles and expectations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the EU dealing in areas and working on issues which now affect the lives of the citizens of the European Union in a very direct way: the launching of the euro, soon not to be just a tool for banks and institutions but also the coins and notes in the pockets of our citizens and, this week, the coming into being of the Amsterdam Treaty with its changing emphasis towards policies that affect people and in particular job creation. When you are talking about jobs and the money in people's pockets, you are talking about issues that very clearly affect the lives of every citizen of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence therefore that there has been a greater concentration on the systems of governance in the European Union. These systems were found wanting and they have failed in the last few weeks. We need to see demonstrable change. The next Commission must reflect a new approach to structure and responsibility, not for the sake of form. We are not just looking for a Commission that looks different or pays lip service to difference. We want a European Commission that is different and will deliver policies for people.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect that Commission to be different, to reflect the real work to be done. If I may say so, we do not want a Commission with structures and portfolios that simply reflect a division of the spoils between twenty Commissioners for whom the President must find a role and must find a job in order to make them look as if they are all important. We want a serious attempt to create a dynamic approach to delivering policies for the people of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">After today, Mr Prodi, you and what you will do will be scrutinised as never before. What appointments you make to your office, the multinational nature or flavour or otherwise of your staff, the gender balance, all these will assume an importance quite disproportionate to their actual significance. Your ability to demonstrate that you have had a role that befits the President of the Commission in deciding who should be in your Commission and what their portfolios should be – all these things will give your presidency and your Commission its opening strengths and, indeed, could well give them its opening weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I was glad that today you concentrated very much on the broader approach to your political thinking and programme for the European Union. In your last intervention in this House – which we all recognised was a very preliminary one, indeed you said so yourself – you made a largely economic presentation. Today you have looked at a much broader scope of policies with which you will be seeking to deal. We have had a flavour of some of your ideas, for instance on foreign and security policy, on home and justice affairs. I very much welcome your thinking in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Your emphasis on the competence of Commissioners and their ability and willingness to act as a team is very much to be welcomed. Your emphasis on structuring the portfolios on the basis of delivering policies and your undertaking on transparency and openness are also very welcome. Of course I do not need to say that we have had such commitments before but we take you at your word that you are serious about these.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a criticism and I would appreciate your comments in your concluding statement. Your speech today talked very little of people. You mentioned employment but you did not talk much about the need for the fight against social exclusion, the struggle for a fair and just Europe for all our citizens, the need to support Member States in the eradication of poverty, in particular amongst the young and the old in our societies, the need for equal opportunities for men and women, for black and white citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, your humanity was clear in your speech. Your commitment to peace on this continent is to be commended. I would have liked to hear a bit more about your belief in a multi‐racial, multi‐ethnic, multi‐cultural Europe. I hope you can reassure us of this in your conclusion. By way of conclusion, for me, as a Londoner, this weekend the importance of support for a Europe of fairness and justice for all our citizens, the need for us to be committed to the fight against intolerance, racism and hatred, against those concepts, was brought very graphically and tragically to our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Union is about a vision for the future. The big issue for our continent, for our economy, is also about people. If you are able to combine these elements successfully with a new Commission structure and ethos, you will have our support.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martens </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prodi, on behalf of our group I should like to reiterate what I said on 13 April. We strongly and unequivocally endorse your candidacy for President of the Commission. We are convinced that you possess the political and professional skills to overcome the deep crisis in which the Commission finds itself. And this crisis must prompt us to carry out historic reforms. You have to reform the Commission, its cabinets and its administration. The problems started ten years ago, so the report of the Wise Men tells us. So as the present Commission has said, a new European political and administrative culture is required. But political reforms are needed too, which have been very clearly set out in a number of reports and documents of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Herman report on institutional reforms which can be carried out without amendment of the Treaty mentions reducing the number of portfolios and sharing them out rationally within the Commission, and striking the correct balance between the collective and individual responsibility of the Commission members. I should be glad to hear your comments on that in your reply. Our group is very much in favour of interinstitutional cooperation. In 1994 as group chairman, I took the initiative in favour of changing the <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> between the Commission and the European Parliament. Mr Oreja gave us vigorous support on that. I think this <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> needs to be revised and expanded once again. New agreements have been concluded, and the new arrangement should be adopted under optimum conditions and approved before the new Commission takes up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">In another report, by Elmar Brok, Parliament argues that members of the Commission should possess appropriate expertise and above all be independent. The Commission must remain the guardian of the Treaties and serve the common interest. Our group wants to see a politically balanced Commission, with men and women, which enjoys broad majority support in Parliament. After your ratification by Parliament, Mr Prodi, you will be able to demonstrate your political leadership in the appointment of the new Commissioners. We hope that your legitimate authority as President will be a factor in securing their approval.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, we are impressed by what you have said. You wish to give new momentum to the European Union. Political union is one of your major objectives, together with further democratisation, transparency and cooperation with Parliament. But I think that since we have the new Commission President here with us, we also need to talk about a number of fundamental avenues of policy which you will also have to confront and where you too will be required to shoulder your responsibilities. We cannot ignore the role and responsibility which the European Union should undertake in helping to end the European tragedy going on in Kosovo, where the most basic of values are being denied – basic values, human values with which we are so quick to identify. A logic of war is being created there, based on discrimination, on crimes against humanity, on the desire for vengeance, on intolerance. It is an important fact, Mr Prodi, that where Europe – as embodied in the European Union, in European countries and regions – is not present, where there is no solidarity within the European Union, war in Europe is still possible.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need more Europe, and a European policy which produces tangible benefits throughout the European continent. We must make it clear to people in the Balkans that peace and reconstruction are only possible in the context of the European Union. The spirit of Community solidarity made it possible for Europe to have states based on the rule of law, dialogue, democratic institutions and recognition for minorities, and that spirit may also put an end to a conflict which has plagued the peoples of south‐eastern Europe for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">How can these peoples, so desperately hard hit by the war, regain hope and trust? We must show vision and generosity to lay the foundation for reconstruction and development in the Balkans in the spirit of the Marshall Plan, which in 1947 gave our countries the strength to reorganise themselves and recover.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area in which you have to deliver is the Union"s ability to pursue a true foreign and security policy. Naturally the Council has supreme responsibility here, and when I think back to Maastricht, Mr President‐in‐Office, it has shown supreme negligence. What has been achieved in the last seven years? The Council will of course take an important decision in Cologne when it appoints Mr or Mrs CFSP. But the lessons we have to learn from current events go much further than that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an imbalance of power between the USA and Europe when it comes to the strategic decisions taken by NATO. But the recent NATO summit opened up a new prospect. The Amsterdam Treaty confirmed the longer‐term objective of a European defence arrangement. Regrettably, it has to be said that we are still a long way from that reality. We do not have any common weapons manufacturing capability. We have no sharing of operational duties. We have no integrated fighting forces and command structure. In short, we do not have the military capability of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the European peace corps in the Kosovo conflict? What is the Western European Union doing? Where are our spy satellites to provide the requisite intelligence? The answer to these questions is a resounding silence. There is a European vacuum. And nature, as we learned at school, abhors a vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third major policy direction which you will have to address, and you referred to it just now. The future construction of Europe: now that we have the euro, you want to give political union a chance. In this House there have been majority or consensus votes in favour of a constitution establishing clear relationships between the Union, the Member States and the rights of European citizens. I think the institutional dynamic also has to be revived, these clear lines have to be drawn, if an enlarged Union is to be workable. Will you revive the institutional dynamic, will you create that new chance? Are you amenable to suggestions from Parliament and its Committee on Institutional Affairs for shaping a Community approach rather than a purely intergovernmental one, which has made its limitations obvious? Parliament has suggested that the Commission, in consultation with the European Parliament and, for example, on the basis of opinions prepared by leading experts and in consultation with the national parliaments, might make it possible to revive this institutional dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">In your first address on 13 April and again now, you have argued for a Europe not just of markets and banks, but a Europe which includes its cultural and spiritual dimension. Hearing you just now listing the various programmes for employment, training, consumers and the environment, I think there is a wide range of areas being addressed. Mr Prodi, are you – I am sure you are – in favour of the European Union as a social market economy? You also spoke of those people, to whom Mrs Green referred, who are being excluded. Equal opportunities for men and women, for black and white, for people of any colour on the basis of the human dignity of each individual – that is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, its human face. You are undoubtedly in favour of that, and you will undoubtedly seek with your new Commission to further that, just as you will undoubtedly bring about political union and give Europe the means, the capacity, to play a proper role in Europe and the world through its common foreign and defence policy. That will make you a great President of a great Commission, working together with a new Parliament which will undoubtedly be keen to work with you towards achieving those ends.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cox </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – I should like first of all to thank Mr Prodi for elaborating today at much greater length on a number of the priorities which he wishes to emphasise for the next Commission. The full definition of the Prodi project properly should await the new parliamentary mandate and the nomination of the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish however today to make some remarks on the policy side arising from what Mr Prodi has said. I take note of that fact that as he talked about Europe's profile in the world he referred to enlargement and mentioned that enlargement will move the epicentre of the European Union towards the east. I would like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to place a somewhat greater emphasis on the urgency of achieving as early as possible an enlargement towards the east.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say to Mr Prodi that some weeks ago at a Liberal International Congress in Brussels we were addressed by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Viktor Orban. He reminded us of the words of another politician from Eastern Europe, saying that since 1989 they have been told in Central and Eastern Europe that enlargement is always just five years away. We must draw a line under that and we must make sure that during the lifetime of the next Parliament and during the mandate of the Prodi Commission we actually bring about the reality of the first enlargement to the East. For my group that would be a serious and significant priority.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that of course requires greater urgency in modernising the democracy of the Union. That greater urgency has been recognised in the Council suggestion that we should have an intergovernmental conference beginning next year, something which we subscribe to. I would like to say to Mr Prodi that we, in our group, believe that as part of his European vocation for a new millennium and for the new enlarged Europe – he should perhaps reflect on the desirability of introducing into the debate the concept of a constitution for Europe. The aim here is not to finalise a project which is always evolving, but to help clarify for citizens in a meaningful way the whole complex of the documents we have produced in treaty form, the kinds of priorities that we have for the Union and the limits – because some of course also worry about the excesses of the Union. I certainly would commend to you that you examine the question of bringing forward as part of your project a constitution for Europe in the new millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the formation of the Commission itself, I should say that you have my group's full support. As you leave this House to go to the various capitals and form the Commission, we have a number of priorities we would like to see in respect of balance. It has been mentioned before that we expect to see gender balance. I would also emphasise that we expect to see political balance, that is a balance of political philosophies and views and also a certain balance that reflects the role of the main political forces in this Parliament. This is important.</p>
<p class="contents">You said here today that you intend to have more team work. That is essential. One of your chosen mechanisms to achieve enhanced coordination will be through the Commission Vice‐Presidents.You have not said how many vice‐presidents you anticipate. Perhaps you could be more specific or perhaps that is premature, but I would say this to you, the greater the number of vice‐presidents, the greater the onus to ensure for the sake of balance that some would come from smaller States.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish, Mr Prodi, to anticipate the hearings of Parliament but I do have a question: in the event that Parliament decided that one ro more of the nominee Commissioners was not acceptable, what would you propose to do, given the powers you have under the Treaty of Amsterdam? We urge you, both in choice of your Commissioners and in such an eventuality, to use your fullest powers under that Treaty and to demonstrate that indeed you are your own man.</p>
<p class="contents">In the time that remains to me I should like to turn to Mr Verheugen and to the Council. If I understood correctly, Mr Verheugen, you urged us to complete this procedure of nominating and putting in place the new Commission by the end of July. I respect politically why you say that but it shows scant regard and little understanding for the due process in this Parliament. I want to treat this with urgency but also with due gravity and it would turn this House into a rubber stamp and nothing more if we were rushed into it prematurely by the end of July. Worse than that, if we got it wrong in July, we might want a second bite of the cherry next January and act more vigorously then than need be.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us get right rather than get it early. If there is a problem now with an interim Commission that has lost its moral and political authority to act, the problem arises, in my view, because of the failure of the Council to listen to Parliament and to appoint an effective interim Commission. That is not a failure of this House. It is a failure of the Council.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Puerta </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL). </span><span class="italic">‐ (ES)</span> Mr President, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, Parliament is now able to exercise the great responsibility of voting to approve the appointment of the President of the Commission for the first time. In this vote, Members will vote as representatives of the people of Europe, free from any pressure from national governments. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will make its decision on the basis of the commitments made by the candidate regarding his general political outlook and a clear programme of reform for the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent institutional crisis and the verdicts reached by Parliament itself or through the Group of Independent Experts must still be fresh in our minds. We need to move forward to a completely new stage characterised by transparency and efficiency in the work of the Commission and in its relations with Parliament. Collective responsibility must not override the Commissioners" individual responsibility. The incoming President"s role in the appointment of the Commission is therefore crucial. Our group calls on him to play his part in the selection of Commissioners to the full so as to ensure substantial renewal of the College of Commissioners. We need men and women whose career has equipped them to cope with the major political challenges facing the Union and with reforming the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the broad outlines of the candidate"s programme are concerned, we feel bound to express the anxieties raised within our group by some of the statements he made today and on 13 April. We are concerned about the emphasis he placed on competitiveness and the flexibility of labour to the detriment of policies fostering economic and social cohesion. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left urges the incoming President to set out and develop economic and social policies aimed at creating employment. We also urge him to combat social exclusion and poverty by promoting public services across the European Union. I realise that in the present climate it is quite unfashionable to speak up for public services, but we on the left feel it is essential to do so. In our view, this should be accompanied by a gradual reduction in working time without a reduction in salary. Action against social dumping and financial speculation is also needed. To sum up, monetarist ideology must not be allowed to dominate to the detriment of our citizens" social and political rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, other key features of a progressive policy are the integration of environmental protection into all Community policies and the review of the ceiling for own resources in the Agenda 2000 financial perspective. Preservation of the Union"s internal solidarity through its Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund should also be part of such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also believe that the Commission must make a great effort to prepare an Intergovernmental Conference to achieve the institutional reforms required prior to enlargement. In this connection, the Commission and its President must, with Parliament"s support, boost the Council"s scant political will to define a common foreign and security policy for Europe which is not subservient to the United States. It must serve to guarantee human rights in the Balkans and the world over, and ensure that international law is adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">In the few seconds remaining, I feel obliged to express my amazement at the reference made to the definition of a constitution for Europe. I have been a member of the Committee on Institutional Affairs for eight years. A draft constitution for Europe was withdrawn during the previous term, before the elections. It was only a draft or an outline and was never made public. There were absolutely no further developments for the next five years. Throughout those five years the subject of a constitution for Europe was taboo. Yet now the spokespersons for the major groups are referring to the drafting of such a document as a key part of the Commission"s work. Actions speak louder than words. I urge you all to take responsibility for your statements in the House today in favour of a constitution for Europe before European public opinion. The people need to be aware of their rights and responsibilities over and above the squabbling and the vested interests of the Member States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pasty </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President‐designate, we are delighted to welcome you for a second time to this House. However, you are only just at the beginning of a series of hurdles which must be overcome in the next eight months. You will have to demonstrate great stamina and skill to stay the course. Although the confirmation of your appointment tomorrow by the European Parliament is not in question, and will doubtless be approved by a very large majority, you will have to face a much more difficult test in September. This is when, in front of a largely new Parliament, you will have to present all your Commissioners and an action plan for which not just you personally but the new Commission collectively must take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole process will then begin again at the end of the year as, having completed the term of office of the outgoing Commission, you will again have to ask for the confidence of the European Council and the European Parliament for a five‐year term. Of course, this term may be interrupted at any time by a motion of censure vote which is clearly now no longer just a theoretical concept. Suffice it to say that your task will not be particularly easy. To avoid tripping over the successive hurdles which you will have to overcome, you must bear in mind that your legitimacy as President of the Commission is delegated and will be exercised under the constant political scrutiny of the Council and Parliament, themselves directly and politically responsible to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, the institutional balance between the Commission, Parliament and the Council is of prime importance and the function and role of each institution must be clearly specified. Your main task, Mr Prodi, will be to ensure that the Commission exercises all the powers conferred on it by the Treaties, but does not encroach on the decision‐making powers of Parliament and the Council. In particular, you must resist the pressures which may come from the Council or Parliament to extend your field of action to areas not specifically indicated by the Treaties and which, as has recently been observed, you do not have the administrative or financial resources to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be responsible for ensuring that the work of the College is restricted to the powers granted by the Treaties, which are already quite considerable. Together with the Court of Justice, the Commission is actually the guardian of the Treaties. However, this function would be better served if its definition were improved in respect of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which are not currently sufficiently clear or definite. The same applies for the monopoly of initiative. This point will have to be clarified during the institutional reform which must take place before any further enlargement. The Commission"s implementing powers, particularly in the area of competition and state aid, are considerable and must be exercised independently but also with absolute transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of commercial or financial negotiations, it is essential that the European Union speaks with one voice. But this voice must be authorised. The aims of the negotiation must be clearly specified in the negotiating mandate given by the Council, with the agreement of Parliament, whose representatives must be kept well informed of the progress of these negotiations, as is the case with the members of the US Congress. If our partners realise that the European Union is expressing the will of the people of Europe, this can only serve to strengthen the EU"s negotiating position. This has not always been the case in the past and the trade dispute on banana imports from ACP countries has left a bitter taste in our mouths.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐designate, your success will be measured by your ability to ensure that the Commission reassumes the role assigned to it by the founders of the European Union. It should be an independent body whose task is to find the largest common denominator – and not the smallest – to ensure that European unification advances only in those areas where it is necessary and essential. In this respect, the institutional balance must be preserved: decision‐making powers must remain with the Council and Parliament, which alone are politically responsible to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The UPE Group wishes you every success in this difficult task, Mr Prodi.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the outgoing Commission showed above all that a more democratic balance of power was needed between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Without a strong Commission, Parliament cannot hope for any major reform of the institutions, which has been put off for years. The Greens are confident, Mr Prodi, of receiving your pledge here that you will make every effort at the intergovernmental conference to ensure that Parliament evolves into a true parliament with full powers of legislative codecision which extend to agriculture and compulsory expenditure, and with full powers of scrutiny over the implementation of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are poised at a historic crossroads. Either Parliament continues to grow and the building of Europe becomes a true democratic project, or it remains a collection of bureaucratic nuts and bolts with no legitimacy, and that would be fatal. It is not just a question of more power for Parliament; our peoples have to be involved more actively in this process and must know and feel themselves to be citizens of the Union. As you know, Mr Prodi, Parliament wants a convincing reform of the Commission. We need a transparent Commission, with ready public access to documents, and that requires swift implementation of Article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The individual responsibility of Commissioners remains a central factor in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament. The Amsterdam Treaty gives you the opportunity to intervene if there are problems with the work of individual Commissioners. We also expect you to put together the right Commission, so that through you we too can have an influence if there are problems with the performance of individual Commissioners. What you said about the need for the big countries to have a Commissioner from the majority as well as from the opposition is being misused in Germany, for example, in order to sideline the Green partner in the coalition. If the new Commission only includes representatives of the largest partner in the government and the largest opposition partner, there will be little political innovation in the Commission. We want you, Mr Prodi, to argue for political diversity in the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens have listened carefully to your speech today, which sits well with the letter you sent us and which says more about sustainable development, the environment and consumer protection than your first speech did. We shall hold you to all of that. In April, you distanced yourself clearly from the American model and came out in favour of the European one, but you said very little about what that meant in practice. For us, it should emphatically mean that not everything is governed by the logic of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">If you seek to liberalise services without securing a universal service, that may give rise to problems. In the past, investment aid has been provided for purposes of rationalisation. We believe that innovation should be the focus of future aid, for example for SMEs, with a view to preserving and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is our fervent hope that, given the necessary weight, you will urgently work for an initiative on the Balkans and see that the timetable for enlargement is politically reassessed in the light of what is going on there at present. In this spirit and in the expectation that you will take our concerns on board, my group is planning to support your candidacy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lalumière </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President‐designate, listening to you just now made me think of the very high hopes resting on your appointment. This is taking place at a very special moment, namely the final part‐session of the Parliament elected in 1994. This coincidence, which was not planned, is giving this debate and the subsequent vote a rather dramatic nature as, to a certain extent, it represents the political legacy of the first European Parliament that had the ability to apply enough pressure on the outgoing Commission to force it to resign.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expectations of you are high, Mr Prodi, and they involve so many and such a variety of issues that you will no doubt find us very demanding, although your introductory speeches have already highlighted many of these points.</p>
<p class="contents">As the recent crisis has revealed the problems within the Commission, your first task will be to put your house in order. This is the work of a leader. You will therefore undoubtedly have to improve the coordination of the Commissioners" responsibilities, redefine the tasks to be accomplished by eliminating some and developing others, and reform the management methods, the procedures for awarding contracts, the use of consultants and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a long way from high politics, which is not possible, however, without a good administration. There is no doubt that in the past the Commission has too easily forgotten this sound principle. In particular, Mr Prodi, in terms of practical politics, Parliament expects enough vision and inspiration from you to meet the challenges facing Europe. In saying this, I am not just thinking of the programmes planned for future years, such as the implementation of Agenda 2000 or the institutional reforms the Union needs in order to complete the Amsterdam Treaty, but also the problems which go beyond these elements. Now more than ever the Union needs to rediscover and reaffirm the meaning of its very existence and its true priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment is therefore not a run‐of‐the‐mill requirement but a major priority which must take precedence over others. I am pleased that you yourself recently proposed that the central banks should depart from their customary financial practices and draw on their reserves to revive the economy at all costs. We must find a new balance between the social and political Europe and the economic and monetary Europe, and we must counterbalance liberalism to some degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, in view of the war in Kosovo and the fragility of Europe revealed by this war, we firmly hope that the European Union can stop considering the future of our continent – including Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and the Mediterranean – in such a cautious manner to the extent that this approach becomes constrained and ultimately foolhardy. This combination of nationalism and violence will form the backdrop to your actions in the next five years. In view of these threats, we would ask you to reaffirm the fundamental values of Europe and to give the EU a clear foreign and security policy and firm social priorities. In short, we need inspiration born of justice and fairness.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonde </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group cautions against appointing Mr Prodi as President of the Commission. We have no need of a new President at present. What we do need is a clear‐out by strong personalities who do not have ambitions to continue when the clear‐out has been completed. Firstly, we should remove the present Commission, because the Commissioners have been deemed to be collectively irresponsible. They themselves rejected individual accountability and asked to be held collectively to account. That is what the Committee of Experts did. Now they must step down, and Parliament should ensure that before they do so, they do not extend contracts with their friends or have certain people promoted or move employees from their own cabinets to the administration. Secondly, we should call the officials responsible to account. The Committee of Experts should name everyone who has helped to obstruct the uncovering of dubious deals. Those who have contributed to corruption and fraud must be subjected to disciplinary proceedings. Those who have covered things up must be suspended, because it has to be worse to cover up corruption than to provide information about corruption, as Mr van Buitenen did, with suspension and salary deductions as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We must then adopt a modern law on public administration and openness. All appointments should be made on the basis of applications and qualifications, not as political appointments. All employees should know that future promotion is a question of effort, not of friendships and contacts. The best person for the job should be promoted. Anyone who occupies a managerial position must be more capable than those beneath him. We cannot have a situation where the more capable are passed over for promotion and then lose motivation and console themselves with privileges.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be decentralised, so that the staff are given responsibility and authority to live up to. Let us put an end to the concentration of power in the hands of a few, without any possibility of them taking responsibility. Let us put an end to complicated procedures where a decision has to be endorsed twenty times and it is impossible afterwards to say who is really responsible. There should also be a reform for officials, including fixed‐term contracts and the introduction of ordinary northern European civil service salaries for new recruits. Privileges can be phased out. The first step could be to remove the automatic cost of living adjustment. It will not be popular, but who is going to defend the fact that the first consequence of moving a task to Brussels is that those who are going to carry it out will receive a trebled salary, diplomatic status with freedom from prosecution, access to business lunches and duty‐free spirits? The salaries of Commissioners should also be reduced before appointments are made. A Commissioner should be paid the same as a minister in the country he represents, and should pay tax so that at least in that respect he loses his status as an expatriate eurocrat. Removal costs should be reimbursed on the basis of invoices, not in the form of two months' extra salary. It should be possible for Parliament to inspect the travel and entertainment budget. The three years of redundancy pay with a subsequent pension should only be paid if the Commissioner does not obtain other employment. We must at last have a reform that produces openness, whereby documents in the Commission will at least also be available to Parliament as soon as the Commission has delivered them to a committee, an undertaking, a country, a journalist or another external party.</p>
<p class="contents">We have drawn up a proposal on openness which we look forward to discussing with Mr Prodi at our public group meeting this evening at 7 p.m. in meeting room 2 here in the Palais building. Like every modern business, the Union must focus on what it can do better than others, or in other words leave alone tasks which others can do better or more cheaply, concentrate on cross‐border cooperation and allow other matters to return to the Member States. This rationalisation must be carried out before the appointment of the new Commission, so there are many general reasons for postponing the approval of Mr Prodi, but my group also has a political reason: Mr Prodi wishes to see a United States of Europe. We would rather unite Europe in a Europe of the democracies.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Muscardini </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr Prodi, we regret that your timely speech comes at a moment of what I might call procedural confusion in both this House and the Council of Ministers. I welcome this morning's offer by the Council to cooperate with the Commission and Parliament. We would have appreciated an equally cooperative spirit in recent months, for example when it was a matter of the Members' Statute or the technical and procedural aspects of electing the Commission President.</p>
<p class="contents">But if the Council has finally realised that it is one of the three components of Europe and must show due respect to the Parliament and Commission, we are pleased with this new discovery and hope that our future work will benefit. We, for our part, are convinced that the Commission President must have a strong Commission – as Professor Prodi stated this morning – a Commission whose relations with Parliament are transparent and based on timetables which are always respected, enabling us to work and make progress together, rather than engaging in confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the next part‐session in July, therefore, Mr Prodi must present us with a schedule of the commitments to which he has so appropriately referred this morning; otherwise enlargement, which is now on the horizon, would prove impossible. You touched on many important points, Mr President, but allow me to recall that – in the opinion of Alleanza Nazionale – more attention should perhaps be paid to Mediterranean policy, especially since you yourself have stated that a Europe looking to the east obviously cannot pay sufficient attention to the serious problems of the Mediterranean. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the euro. Although you are an economist and this must sound very familiar to you, I would point out that if, before creating a common monetary policy, we had had the intelligence to create an economic policy, then perhaps the euro would not now be weaker than the dollar on markets around the world. If we had created an economic policy, we would have laid down the foundations, or guidelines, for Europe's economic future and might have reduced unemployment by a few percentage points, thereby restoring the confidence which the people are beginning to lose.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, we are enthusiastic about your proposals and prepared to work with you, as a Parliament and as a political group, as long as your commitments are not only clear but also clearly timetabled, and as long as they are not merely declarations of intent at the start of your term of office but a definite path for us to follow together.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colajanni </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I welcome the Council President's announcement that the final vote on the entire Commission is to be brought forward. This is without doubt an important matter: as Parliament has stressed several times, the Commission must be in a position to address itself to the outstanding issues as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast with previous occasions, I also welcome the preparatory work done by Mr Prodi, the nominee for President, with regard to reform of the Commission. He has indicated important changes in respect of teamwork, responsibility and transparency, with a view to tackling and solving satisfactorily the crisis affecting the Commission. I would stress that, irrespective of the crisis in recent months, there has been a blurring of the Commission's political role over the past few years. Indeed, the crisis of the past few months could make us forget that the EU needs a politically strong Commission. This, Mr Prodi, is what the European Parliament expects you to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">You can be sure that, if you embark on this road, you will receive strong support from the European Parliament. We are opposed to any reduction in the Commission's political role, and we regard the political balance between Commission, Parliament and Council as a cornerstone of European democracy. Naturally, this attempt to redefine the European Union's overall prospects also affects the responsibilities of Parliament and the Council – and we shall discuss this point among others with the new Commission. As far as you yourself are concerned, it is a matter of political leadership to make the Commission a strong partner in dialogue on the major unanswered questions determining the EU's development and identity. These political matters are also of great institutional relevance, as was stressed for example by Mr Martens, who pointed out that the reform of the relationship between the institutions will be a key theme in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an abstract issue; it relates to the way in which we tackle the main items on our agenda, such as enlargement, institutional reform as such, and the creation of a common foreign policy and defence structure which – as shown by the events in Kosovo – Europe desperately needs, since it is proving incapable of tackling independently crises such as the one under way in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the important matter of efforts to galvanise Europe's economy – you made several references to this in your speech – and to introduce a new but vital element of balance: a social dimension. Parliament, the Commission and the Council have been debating this matter for years. Attempts have sometimes been made to strike a balance between these two aspects: for example, the Delors White Paper sought to bring them together, to balance them. Perhaps much of this is no longer topical, but the problem of harmonising these two elements is one of the main political problems confronting not only the Commission but also Parliament and the EU in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to dwell on this. The Commission will of course have its own political opinions here and will compare notes with Parliament and the Council. There have in the past been differences over strategy, which have subsequently been settled and have enriched the political debate between our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This also applies to the Balkans. Mr President, I welcome your determination to put together rapidly the elements of an overall proposal for that region, so as to create a stable relationship offering a way out of existing and potential conflicts which – as you say – can be averted and resolved in the context of a close relationship with the European Union. This also applies to the Serbian people, who will free themselves of Milosevic as soon as they are offered the alternative of relations with Europe.</p>

You will realise from this morning's debate that we also expect a good deal of you, since we know you to be a man of great initiatives and ideals, but one who is at the same time extremely practical. Both of these attributes are needed to head the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">These expectations are further fuelled by the boldness of your pro‐European spirit and philosophy, which have emerged from your two speeches before this House. I hope – and I am quite sure – that they will be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect you to be proactive in exercising your prerogatives as President of the Commission, not only as guardian of the Treaties and of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , but we also expect a bold initiative to carry forward the completion of the institutional structure, so as to give the Europe of the euro a real personality, identity and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">One obvious item of unfinished institutional and political business, which is a challenge for the next parliamentary term and might well be proposed to our successors, is an undertaking to complete the building of Europe. The constitutional dialectic between the EU and its Member States over the next five years will probably be dominated by this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, has said repeatedly: ‘You have entrusted me with the task of safeguarding the value of the euro and guaranteeing price stability. If you leave me alone to pursue these objectives, I assure you that the consequence will be an increase in unemployment in Europe, because the instruments available to me will undoubtedly lead to new social problems. Hurry up and equip yourselves with institutions to run the economy: the European Central Bank on its own cannot tackle problems which are not of its making.'</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken the first tentative steps towards harmonising our economic policies: Mr Monti's blueprint for fiscal policy harmonisation has yet to be approved; the subject of a European employment pact is to come up at the forthcoming European Council in Cologne. Specific conclusions are required here too, after Mr Junker's initiative at the Luxembourg European Council, and after the Aznar and Blair proposals relying on labour market flexibility. Mr Strauss‐Kahn made an interesting proposal just the other day. It is interesting because he is a Socialist and because he is French: he is a Socialist, and asserts that the problem of unemployment can only be addressed by setting a 3 % growth target; he is French, and asserts that we must begin to regard the Euro 11 Council as the first step towards a European economic government.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic policy must be harmonised at European level. ‘The impossible status quo' was the title of the document of the Florence Group. Well, Europe cannot stand still; if it stood still, it could go into reverse. Although we now have the euro, much remains to be done and we must press on. If the markets notice that the pace of politics is slackening, they will adapt by relaxing their sense of responsibility. This is already happening – it is what has happened since the introduction of the euro: we sense a slowdown in political responsibility and initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now feeling the effects on Europe's economic equilibrium of the economic slowdown in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, countries which account for 80 % of our GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, everything is a matter of urgency for the EU. Another major challenge is the war in Kosovo. This morning we have at last heard some encouraging news from the United States, after the meeting between Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Clinton: there now appears to be a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as such, has played no role whatsoever in this affair and is also demonstrating severe limitations in assisting the refugees, that is for sure. Not only NATO but also many countries, as well as Europe – which previously had always excelled at providing humanitarian aid – are incapable of meeting the challenges resulting from this war. Europe has still not activated the analysis unit for active conflict prevention policies – even though this House approved a proposal to that effect – and must regain its dignity, ambition and responsibility by taking an initiative. We detected such ambition in your speech, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 undoubtedly goes in the right direction: that of integrating countries which have been knocking at Europe's door for ten years. But if Yugoslavia is both the reality and the metaphor illustrating the difficulty – even now – of ensuring the coexistence of different ethnic groups, then we must acknowledge – as you have done – that true coexistence can only be achieved in the bosom of Europe, and not by creating small statelets which are increasingly inward‐looking and ethnically homogeneous. Therefore, confronted as we are by an international crisis which calls into question our certainty at the end of the Second World War – that war would never again be possible in Europe – we must set ourselves new, inevitably ambitious political aims if we really do wish to rediscover the soul of Europe to which you have often referred.</p>

Many of us had therefore been hoping that – not least to dispel the dark and unjust initial coincidence affecting your new term of office – after 40 days of war in Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Voivodina, you would have found the right words today to appeal for an immediate cease‐fire and some words of solidarity for all the innocent victims, on all sides, and then made some practical proposals for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed and for an early return of the refugees: the search for a European soul, Mr Prodi, as you once put it in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">You chose a different option, however: you chose to define the war as ‘painful but necessary'. As to the future, you merely referred to a general and – at present – vague international conference on the Balkans, skirting the pressing and highly urgent problems, and even evoking the unfortunate image of the ‘common sword of Europe', an expression loathed by Jacques Delors.</p>
<p class="contents">On environmental issues, you stated that the harmonisation of ecological taxes and of the Member States' environmental rules and regulations would be a priority. I would remind you that, according to the report from the European Environmental Agency a few months ago, eleven of the top twelve environmental problems have either worsened or remained the same within the European Union since 1995. It is not enough to mention the environmental troubles of Europe's cities, as you have done, without tackling the underlying cause: the disproportionate increase in private transport, partly fuelled by incentives to the car industry, and the simultaneous decline of public transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Prodi, I would ask you to clarify the disturbing passage in your speech of 13 April where you called for investment in research and development in the ‘life sciences'. What do you mean by this: to push forward genetic engineering on an industrial scale, thereby bringing about eugenics? I would very much appreciate a clear answer.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Prodi on his appointment by the European Council as President‐designate of the Commission, and I am quite certain that recommendation will be ratified overwhelmingly by the European Parliament this week. I want to take the opportunity of wishing Mr Prodi well in his new and, indeed, highly responsible position.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Mr Prodi, will be assuming the presidency of the Commission at a very challenging time for the European Union. Tough decisions and policy directions will have to be worked out by the Commission and this must be done in consultation with the European Parliament and the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say at the outset that Parliament must recognise that if the European Commission is to oversee its duties in an effective manner, that may require more staffing resources in the future. We have to be assured that, as the process for the enlargement of the Union takes place, the Commission is appropriately staffed to deal with the challenges that lie ahead for it and, indeed, the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is built on a consensual approach. That has been the main foundation for the success of the European Economic Community and now the European Union over the last 40 years. It is important when tough decisions are taken that all 15 Member States of the Union are fully involved in such a process. It has been clearly proven that there is complete consensus across the length and breadth of Europe that balanced political programmes should be put in place. The Single Act, which heralded the need to complete the internal market where there would be free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, has been a notable success. The Maastricht Treaty put in place the European currency and has also proved to be an innovative act of political foresight on behalf of the Union itself. It is very clear that, as EMU takes a hold within the Union, the reduced cost of doing business and the elimination of transaction costs will ensure that European Union businesses become more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to my next point: as the internal market and EMU become established, it is imperative that the poor regions of the Union secure appropriate regional, social, agricultural, fishery and cohesion funds so as to guarantee that they can compete on a level playing field with all other Member States of the Union. We do not and cannot afford to put in place a two‐tier European Union where wealthier Member States are put in one bracket and poorer Member States in another. We need to upgrade the standard of living in many parts of the Union. My own constituency of Connacht‐Ulster in the west of Ireland and the border counties has a strong case for long‐term regional and social funds during the next Community support framework and thereafter. Long‐term strategies must be put in place to ensure that the poorer and peripheral regions of my country are helped to become competitive in terms of the attraction of business, as well as the improvement of their respective transport and water‐treatment services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that a framework must be put in place to permit new Member States from Eastern and Central Europe to join the European Union. It is important that these countries endeavour to comply with as much of the European body of law in the form of directives and regulations as possible. This is known as the implementation of the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span> and is also important in the context of giving opportunities to Irish and European businesses to start up their operations in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the addition of an extra 70 million people to the Union must be viewed positively. This is good news for the broadening of the trade relations with all Member States of the Union itself.</p>

However, you have not made any significant comment with regard to this request. Now you have the opportunity to do so, as not only is the European Parliament in its entirety here today, but also many of its political groups, which have discussed this important issue on a previous occasion. As the Treaty of Amsterdam has now entered into force it is incumbent on all the institutions to ensure that the issue of equality between men and women is an integral part of their programme. This must also be visible <span class="italic">inter alia </span> in the composition of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my attention that there is in existence an unofficial list of candidates for membership of the Commission, and that on this list there are only three women. This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs. There are five women in the present Commission, and it would certainly be a massive leap backwards if we were not to aim for a larger number of female Members of the Commission. I would like to point out that the Member States with small populations do not have any kind of prerogative in this matter, but we must insist that small Member States, with just one Commission Member, should recognise that women too are experienced and qualified, and that there are female candidates to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you are required to discuss this issue with the Member States, and I would ask you now whether or not you intend to raise the matter with the Heads of State and Government?</p>

You want to bring the administration under political control, and you have our support for this. But please let your administration know that the balance has shifted between Parliament and the administration in Brussels, and that the administration must act accordingly in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the eyes of the European public the new Commission will be a European government. Perhaps the Treaty does not quite say so, but you need to want to be a sort of European government. In your statement you mentioned almost all the key words for the next five years: agriculture and towns, competition and social affairs, youth, the elderly, public limited companies, small and medium‐sized enterprises, consumer protection and liberalisation, enlargement and relations with the USA. However, Mr Prodi, I would have liked to see rather less pointillism and rather more constructivism in the picture you painted of the new Commission"s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Prodi, in tomorrow"s vote we shall be endorsing both yourself as an individual and your political work to date. This will strengthen your future political authority. We expect you to use this political authority in forming the new Commission and in your political leadership of the new Commission over the next five years. Tomorrow you will be given a preliminary vote of confidence – including from my group – but you should not be under the impression that you can rely on this confidence for five years. You will have to build this trust yourself through your work. We are prepared to help you because we believe it will serve Europe. We wish you every success.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brok </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the candidate designated by the European Council for the office of Commission President, Mr Prodi, will come into office in a situation unknown to any of his predecessors. No one has been nominated Commission President in a crisis of this kind, and no one before him became Commission President with direct democratic legitimation from a directly‐elected Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that both these factors will enable him to meet the considerable challenges which he and the future Commission will face. Like Klaus Hänsch, I too would like to say that as a result of your great achievements, Mr Prodi, you will have our vote of confidence and our hopes will rest on you. During your period of office you will have to achieve two things at the same time. You will have to ensure the consolidation of the European Union, whose tasks and size have increased dramatically in recent years and decades and, where necessary, you will have to put the Union"s house in order to ensure that it is viable and able to function even if nothing new is added. At the same time you are expected to have vision. These are two things that are seldom compatible but because of the historical situation they must both be achieved: consolidation and vision.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in the knowledge of what happened with the former Commission you will undertake the necessary institutional reforms; furthermore, you will tackle the issues of personal accountability, internal controls and financial control, increased efficiency and the related right of control of the European Parliament over the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks and months we will certainly have to devise ways to organise the interaction between the Commission and Parliament as its supervisory body, with the relevant reporting and the provision of information to Parliament"s committees.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only the radical structural reform of the Commission, for which Parliament has put forward concrete proposals, that is at issue; we also have to recognise that the European Parliament must be reorganised in the same way in order to do justice to its tasks. We too still have work to do if we are to deal properly with our new rights and the extra rights that Mr Verheugen rightly called for the European Parliament to be given. We are also all aware that because of its lack of transparency the third main institution, the Council, is a significant obstacle to acceptance among the public. We will only be able to promote the European Union in the eyes of the people if it proves itself to be efficient, transparent and democratic at the same time. These three factors are required if we are to be accepted by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, as I listened closely to your comments on economic policy, I heard a name that is not often mentioned by politicians and economists these days: Ludwig Erhard. You focused on the market and said that its opportunities must be used to the full because this is the best way to achieve growth and employment. However, you also talked about the fair framework conditions and rules that are necessary because the market cannot achieve this itself. You also said that because of this certain basic conditions must be created in the area of environmental policy, social policy, consumer policy, and safeguarding competition through controls on competition and on financial aid, so that the single market can function as a single market for the whole of Europe and not in small sections.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have another particular problem with this, and in my view we need to solve a legitimation issue here. We have to acknowledge that economic and monetary union is a Community operation. Yet when I see how the finance ministers deal with it and in particular when I look at the role of the ‘Euro 11', I realise that decisions are increasingly slipping into the intergovernmental sphere and that there is little democratic legitimation there for important decisions concerning economic and monetary policy which run parallel to the independence of the European Central Bank. I believe that there is a lot of work yet to be done in institutional terms between Council, Commission and Parliament to prevent this from slipping out of the Community sphere, with the result that the finance ministers become the new masters of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards vision, you commented on the need for foreign representation and on our ability to use enlargement to extend the peace that we have achieved within the Union to the whole of Europe, including the Balkans, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the European Union is certainly one of the fundamental tasks that you will be faced with during your period of office, but an institutional round table is needed on this. In my view it should be organised very quickly and it must set the scene for enlargement, for example by extending majority voting and later – but not too late, and quickly – not as a condition for enlargement but in the progression towards the goal of a constitution and a constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you demonstrate the fact that we are, in my view, returning to a Europe of values. The European Union must not be seen by the people only as a single market, it must be a Europe of common values and a common culture. Our culture gives us more in common than it does to divide us, but all our talk at the moment is about what divides us. We should talk about what we have in common! What distinguishes us in our values and our cultures is not something divisive but a plus, a diversity and an additional wealth. If in this discussion of the fundamental issue of values we can present the kind of Europe once called for in this House by Václav Havel, then we will once again be in a position to find favour with our citizens, who want more than just a single market.</p>

<p class="contents">However, Mr Prodi, I remain confused about your approach to the economy and the environment. Your words convey the idea that development amounts to continuous growth, without any attention to the natural limits of resources. Infinite growth is a dangerous utopia believed in by economists, which cannot be borne out in reality. Admittedly, you have today called for an ecological tax to confront challenges such as climate change – and I am very glad – and you have spoken of sustainable growth, but is there not an obvious contradiction between these assertions and your excessive confidence in the results to be achieved from complete trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation? Rather than bringing about liberalisation, these agreements have concentrated the market in the hands of a few multinationals which have imposed a system of monopolistic control; the clauses on environmental, health and ethical safeguards as well as protection for the weakest peoples in the world have not been implemented since the GATT agreements. One need only think of the confrontation between the United States and Europe over trade in the furs of animals captured by cruel methods, over trade in bananas and hormone‐treated meat, and above all over genetically modified organisms, particularly since the collapse of the Cartagena summit on bio‐security due to US intransigence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although I welcome your proposal for stability in south‐east Europe and an international conference on the Balkans to bring about peace in Europe, I must say that armed intervention has never led to peace; at the very most, it has stopped the fighting but without removing the causes. This is where Europe has failed. In the past it failed to act, but in acting now it has failed to prevent the conflict; and I cannot forget that one of the Italian Government's last decisions when you were Prime Minister, on 12 October 1998, was to make Italian airbases available to NATO in the event of a war in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless wish you all the best for your work. I hope that you will manage to meet the challenges of building Europe whilst taking account of issues such as the environment, health and peace, to which the European people are fully entitled.</p>

In the 1980s Europe"s vision was the completion of the internal market, in the 1990s it is monetary union. The forthcoming phase must be geared towards consolidation and improving and strengthening what has been achieved; it must be a period of root and branch and reform, as Tony Blair put it.</p>
<p class="contents">The root refers to the Commissioners; you are personally involved in their selection and in their quality and success, and you are responsible for them. Renewing the structures, making the procedures more efficient and introducing transparent controls will be difficult enough. The new Commission must be genuinely new in terms of people, thinking and action. You and we owe this to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The branches refer to the organisation as a whole. It must be clear who is in charge of the administration. The report by the Committee of Independent Experts should help you in this, and Parliament"s assistance is assured. It is not enough to try to make the overburdened bureaucracy more efficient. New approaches are needed by increasingly involving the Member States; subsidiarity also relieves the burden on Brussels in implementing European tasks and increases everyone"s sense of responsibility – a sense of responsibility that has hitherto not existed.</p>
<p class="contents">In your first statement you asked not to be judged on your past but on the visions and ideas that you bring to Europe. We will hold you to that.</p>

In my view, he certainly possesses the qualities needed to become a great President of the Commission. As far as Parliament is concerned, I am sure Mr Prodi will pass with distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this Parliament represents the people of Europe. I myself speak for the Spanish Socialist delegation in the European Parliament. Those of us who hail from the south of Europe hope that under Mr Prodi, more account will be taken of certain issues which tended to be sidelined by the previous Commission, that is, those issues concerning relations with the southern flank of Europe. Europe has certainly shifted northwards and eastwards in recent years. This followed the fall of the Berlin wall and enlargement to include countries in central and northern Europe. Plans for further enlargement towards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now under way. There is more to Europe than a single direction however, and we also need to bear in mind the concerns felt along the southern shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The major conflict we are confronted with at the moment is of course in the Balkans, which are at the crossroads between Central and Eastern Europe and southern Europe. They represent a fault line running across Europe which may well give rise to further problems. We must therefore also give consideration to Mediterranean Europe, along with Europe"s involvement in the Maghreb and the Mashreq, the Middle East and even those countries in southern Africa awaiting our cooperation, the ACP countries and the countries of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on a different aspect, I feel that the results of the Berlin European Council have been unduly influenced by economic and technocratic considerations to the detriment perhaps of more fundamental political considerations. In particular, no progress has been made towards improving conditions in rural areas and the agricultural policy is still beset by difficulties. The lack of a European policy for social and economic cohesion is certainly causing problems too. Furthermore, the present relationship between the more developed and the less developed countries and regions has to change. If it does not, there is a risk that we shall find ourselves in a two‐speed Europe with regard to economic and social conditions. As Professor Prodi is well aware, the more developed countries and regions seem to be consolidating their economic progress whereas the less developed areas seem destined to remain firmly fixed in their disadvantaged position.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the economic and technocratic considerations which dominated at the Berlin European Council must be counterbalanced by a Community economic policy which takes into account all the interests of each and every one of the regions and countries of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">It is one of the worst because of the awful events of this spring with the war in Kosovo, the crimes, the deportations and the political weaknesses of our Union which neither we nor you must forget. Fortunately, France and Europe are leading the humanitarian action to remedy and alleviate the worst effects, having failed to avoid these.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one of the best because your appointment, Mr Prodi, gives us hope and a renewed determination. Clearly this is because of who you are, as many of us have already said and written, but also and particularly because of the conditions of your arrival.</p>
<p class="contents">You are fortunate in that you will be the first Commission President to be appointed as a result of the principle of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern democracy aims to be like a temple with foundations of human rights and two pillars of universal suffrage and the principle of responsibility. I am pleased to have heard the word responsibility said so many times this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">And just look at our Europe. It is celebrating fifty years of the Council of Europe whose foundations are so dear to so many of us. Look at our European Community celebrating twenty years of its Parliament being elected by the people. Look at our European Union celebrating the birth of political responsibility, which has come about in rather a strange way as we all know. Thanks to this Parliament, and within it the European Socialists led by Mrs Green, the previous Commission was overturned. Some of its Members did their work well while others did not, but overall it failed politically. Parliament told it so and it resigned. That was the revolution in mid‐March.</p>
<p class="contents">The embryonic European public opinion then called you, Mr Prodi, into its emerging arena and the Heads of State and Government listened to that opinion. This can be regarded as progress. You will allow me as a man of the left to remind you that these Heads of State and Government are also from the left and that the first duty of a left‐wing democrat is to listen to the people. Your speech this morning on full economic liberalisation offends us as Socialists. But we realise that it stems from your need for consensus and that that is the situation we are in. We will therefore vote in favour of your appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">In mid‐June the electors will vote in another election for a new Parliament, a new majority and a new Commission. European democracy is moving forward. This is why in welcoming you, Mr Prodi, it is our democracy which we are honouring, but without forgetting our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Antonio Gramsci spoke of pessimism of the mind and optimism of the heart when he was faced with fascism. You could and you must repeat this phrase today so that our confidence in you will be renewed and our Europe will be renewed. Then we can build that democratic temple and be true to our ideal.</p>

It has expectations of your managerial ability, your communication skills, your strength and your integrity. On managerial skills, you have to inculcate a culture of reform to thousands of people.

<p class="contents">We want from you management by walking about. We want you to do spot checks and to be responsive to detailed criticisms. We need from you communication of a vision and clarity of ideas, but they have to be acceptable ideas. Tax harmonisation is not an acceptable idea for example to my delegation so you cannot promulgate ideas which are not politically acceptable. We need you to be able to communicate with us and with the citizens of the European Union. Above all, we require of you strength and integrity. You have to be able to give adequate answers to the sort of hostile newspaper articles which are in the United Kingdom's press today, for example. That we expect of you.</p>

It cannot be excessively liberal and yet be social and ecological at the same time. You are therefore being called upon to produce a new outline in order to create a new European social and ecological model.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is currently receiving bad press among workers. Public services are being dismantled and universal service is not a remedy. Many workers are unemployed due to liberalisation and globalisation. Although wealth is constantly increasing, poverty and exclusion, unemployment and precarious employment are growing. You will be required, Mr Prodi, to put an end to this scandal and see to it that the European Union becomes a Europe for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The reformist approach you are setting out will require a majority in favour of progress. You will no doubt obtain a very large majority within this House and I hope that this majority will remain stable after the elections. In this respect, I must remind this House and the Commission of the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty gives the European Parliament new rights and also new duties. In my opinion, one of these is the duty of stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the vote for Mr Prodi and the vote for the new College will establish a pact of confidence between Parliament and the Commission that should last for five years. Parliament, which cannot be sanctioned in this institutional system, cannot constantly change the majority or use the motion of censure, except in cases of extreme political danger. In addition, a pact of confidence commits the Commission to being serious‐minded about political planning. Each year, in order to establish the budget and work programme, we must examine the state of progress of the political programme which we will approve with the new College.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Parliament and the Commission must commit themselves to achieving a new level of quality in their political work.</p>

The Greek Socialist MEPs hope you will be appointed. However, the appointment of the President of the Commission is not just a passing event. It creates a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation between the Commission and those who represent the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the people of Europe have unfortunately become mistrustful. Past wrongdoings have undermined the credibility of the European Union. Democracy"s response to this has been to institute transparency. But transparency will never function simply because it is written into the Treaties. It will function if the Commission wants it to and if Parliament permanently demands it. Strict monitoring by Parliament is not an act of aggression, it is an act to safeguard the good reputation of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope with all my heart and, following your speech today, we believe that a new, valuable and constructive period is opening up in the relations between the Commission and Parliament. Once Parliament has confirmed your appointment and endorsed your Commission, we hope that this period will be one of transparency, democracy, human rights and, above all, a time of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of peace, Mr President, I think we all need to understand that, on whatever battlefield the dead may fall, they are all equal.</p>

That gives me some experience. I must admit that after the first two meetings we had together, I was not entirely happy, but now I can say that I was very pleased with the speech you gave here in Parliament today. I am glad that the environment, consumers and employment were included in your speech. I am glad that you stress the fact that it can be beneficial to cooperate. However, there is one thing I am not happy with, and that is the high priority given to the liberalisation of trade within the WTO. I agree, Mr Prodi, that we should strengthen the role of the Commission within the WTO, but I would warn against jeopardising the social dimension and against holding consumers and the environment to ransom. It is extremely important for us also to consider the third world, the poor countries, and to make the WTO work in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing I would like to mention today is your task of reforming the Commission's work and working methods – the new business culture. I am happy with what we have heard today. I hope that the institutions, in other words the Council, Parliament and the Commission, can cooperate on this in future. I have one question: do you share my view that a new start is synonymous with having new Commissioners in all positions?</p>

I should like to stress that in point of fact Parliament has taken many concrete decisions on what the concept of openness and transparency involves. I am firmly convinced that Parliament will not retreat from the position it has already adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is to some extent a question of turning the principle of possibly being open when forced to be so into one of seeking to be as open as possible from the start. Moreover, it is not just a matter of providing information about the institutions' own situation, but of supplying documents and answering the questions which people ask.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it will require a much sturdier framework and more rigorous staff training. Consequently, it will demand a great deal of effort; it is not enough simply to say that we would like greater openness. However, I am holding fast to Mr Prodi's commitment in this respect and I also hope that he understands that a great deal of effort will be needed as well, in order to achieve results.</p>

I will say first of all that the Austrian Social Democrats will also support you. But I will say quite openly that this is not out of total conviction but on the basis of your achievements to date and as an initial vote of confidence. It is obvious that you could not provide answers to several questions at this stage. What bothers me a little – and this is the point I would like to focus on – is the fact that you placed too much emphasis on the market and too little on the social aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">As a tribute to our President, I would like to deal with this using Gramsci terminology. Hegemony – in this case the hegemony of the market – disturbs me both as an economist and as a supporter of the market economy, as we in Europe have developed a model of the social market economy that is concerned particularly with reducing and preventing unemployment. I admit, Mr Prodi, that you have stated clearly today for the first time, as far as I know, that you also want to combat and prevent the causes and sources of unemployment. But that is still a little too weak for me – it still lacks substance.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say it clearly once again: we must strengthen market forces. But we must also be aware that the market can only function in our model if there is as little unemployment as possible and as few social weaknesses as possible in our society, as otherwise the people of Europe will not come along with us. In this respect I welcome you now as our new Commission President and hope that you will be able to restore this balance.</p>

I have listened to you three times today, each time with as much pleasure, but I noted on all three occasions that you did not mention once the concept of Europe as a social union. This concerns me. You naturally spoke about employment but you said nothing about European social dialogue. Nor did you mention the need to establish the basic range of fundamental social rights, without which we will see relocations through fiscal dumping. And although you again announced that the Commission would be developing the liberalisation of the market in goods and services, I heard nothing about public services and the services of general economic interest which now clearly appear in Article 7d of the Amsterdam Treaty. You really must reassure us in this respect if you want your Commission to be in full working order. Do not forget your left wing.</p>

Like you, we are also proud of the enormous effort which was needed to bring certain countries, in particular yours and mine, into the leading group of the European Union and into the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the subject today is the future. You mentioned this, particularly with regard to your plans for a new, transparent and efficient Commission organisation. I am not sure if it is positive or negative that you spoke more about the practical side than the theoretical side. This contrasted with the rest of your speech which was more philosophical, emphatic and profound than pragmatic.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore ask you to clarify certain points. Do you consider that the current institutional framework in which the Commission lies, formed by the principle of parity and equality between Member States, is an essential and historic principle of the Union or do you adhere to the more contemporary arguments which press for prompt and urgent reform? Specifically, should the institutional reform of the Commission, particularly with regard to the number of Commissioners, be carried out in the context of the Treaty in force or are you in favour of an early revision? This is an issue which cannot be avoided even though it is very delicate. The impression you gave us is that you did not want to talk about it, which is a shame because clarity in these matters is essential to allow us to accept the rest of your commendable reform proposals. It is not just a question of ‘putting the house in order"; it is also absolutely essential to reinforce its foundations.</p>

It is an important matter from the point of view of Parliament that you, Mr President‐designate of the Commission, should, in the performance of your duties, make a credible commitment to the reforms that Parliament has called for from the next Commission, and that when you are involved in the selection process with governments, you insist on commitment to those reforms on the part of every Member of the Commission, both separately and jointly. I believe it should also be mentioned that those Members of the present Commission who have performed their duties well, and who are committed to the reforms, will also be needed in the next Commission, as, otherwise, the reforms will not be introduced sufficiently promptly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Prodi, </span> <span class="italic"> nominee for President of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to you for this debate, which has been thorough and wide‐ranging. As has been pointed out, you have expressed your confidence in me and your expectations of me, which I very much appreciate and for which I feel very responsible. The debate has also quite rightly revealed that your confidence is conditional, based on my word, because that is all I can offer for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all that remains for me to say here and now is that I am, quite frankly, very aware of how difficult a time this is and how great your confidence in me is, but also of the fact that I am being put to the test by you and will be even more so by the next Parliament, before which I shall have to return with the full Commission team. On behalf of the Commission team, I shall have to give a hard and fast guarantee of the promises and commitments which I have made during the debates on 13 April and today. Obviously, an act of government is embodied in a government; it cannot simply be summarised in a programme. I therefore just wish to tell you that I feel responsible for the major tasks which you have outlined for the Commission: I fully share your desire that the Commission should return to, or rather should finally assume, its role as stipulated in the Treaties – that of taking initiatives and making policy proposals – and should do so with great clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity has always been an issue. I would remind you that clarity depends on a definition of responsibilities, and I undertake to work hard in this area, which was one of the main causes of the recent crisis: clarity concerning the Commission's collective political responsibility, but also that of the individual Commissioners who are in charge of portfolios and responsible for managing them, as well as the key administrative responsibility for running the Directorates‐General. This is a problem of fundamental importance, which I wished to tackle head‐on by defining the function of the Cabinets – one of the difficulties which has led in the past to tension and misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I am grateful to you for having reminded me of the delicate relationship which will exist between the Commission and the Council, on the one hand, and between the Commission and Parliament on the other. It is a much stronger Parliament, a Parliament which has acquired strength, as happens at times of major institutional growth. I shall therefore have to be transparent, clear and absolutely beyond reproach in my dealings with Parliament; I realise this.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been some difficulty concerning the timing of the investiture. Mr Verheugen, on behalf of the Council, has stressed the need for a rapid investiture procedure. Mr Cox, however, has stressed that a high‐profile parliamentary debate should be held to endorse the new Commission. I believe that both these demands are of great importance; all I can say is that I shall be ready with the entire new team of Commissioners on the day when the new Parliament takes office. I can – and must – make this undertaking to you, so as not to hold up the investiture by a single hour. Naturally, I hope that this will take place rapidly. I repeat, however, that I realise the debate will have to be detailed and thorough in every respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's debate has raised another considerable, deep‐rooted problem to which I believe we shall have to return in coming years. I have been accused of having too much confidence in the market and too little in social Europe. Let us be quite clear: if we put these two terms in contradiction with each other, we shall ruin commercial Europe as well as social Europe. Let us remember that, if we are to give hope to the third world, for which we bear enormous responsibility – indeed, we cannot forget that Europe is the largest economic body in the world; I repeat, the largest economic body in the world – then clearly we must also guarantee a world economic order. The opening‐up of trade over the past few years has led to growth in certain countries which were totally outside the world economy before, and has consequently led – I understand this, and it has emerged in the debate – to serious problems in certain European sectors and certain European countries. But let us not forget that, if we fail to meet this challenge, we will badly disappoint the third world and will fail in our duty to this earth, which has become so complex. This, I assure you, does not detract from – indeed it enhances – the importance of the social dialogue: it becomes all the more important to look after those who are marginalised, the poorest members of society. But we cannot discuss these matters behind closed doors, or as a continent which erects borders, albeit one that has been enlarged. We must do so by meeting the challenge which, in this case, is also a responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">You may think I am saying this to receive your endorsement or backing. That is not true! I, for my part, am firmly convinced in economic terms that the European edifice must be supported by twin pillars. If we really do close our doors, then from the point of view of both peace and development in this world of ours, we shall cause the most serious problems. I am well aware that this opening‐up means that change must be much faster than it was in the past, and that change leads to disruption. The task of the Commission and Parliament, together with the Council, is to move forward in this direction, to assume responsibility for change, because there could obviously be a strong temptation now to close our doors and fall back on conservative positions. That is why we have all devoted ourselves to this major task of introducing progressive reforms. I have outlined a few points here; I have referred to transparency, organisational change, changed relations between the Commission and Parliament, and a change in the structure of administrative relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously this is a gradual process. Anyone who reproaches me for not having come here with a complete edifice is absolutely right. The type of procedure, the type of work which we are building is progressive. Apart from anything else, even though the responsibility will be mine, I shall have to take account of the second report of the Wise Men, to be published in September, just as I have taken account in my thinking so far of their first report, although I repeat that I shall be responsible for the decisions. These documents are vital in shaping our ideas, in organising our thoughts.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our working relations must be continuous, well balanced and strong; that is why, as I have often said, the composition of the Commission must be well balanced, not only politically but also between men and women. I wish to say in this respect that there is no list of Commissioners, not even a provisional one. I have said clearly to the Heads of State and Government, with whom I am establishing an ongoing dialogue to put together a fine Commission: ‘let us not name any names until after the elections!' First of all out of respect for certain countries which have their own internal acceptance procedures; secondly, because we must begin by setting out our work programmes and intentions, and then we can build the Commission. I think it would be utterly wrong to proceed in the opposite fashion. Therefore we shall name names after the elections; all those already mentioned are mere rumours, which count for nothing. That is why, as I have said, I am preparing the ground now: once election‐time comes the government will be formed, in time to be presented to Parliament at its first sitting. That is my plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on a few more points, ones which I think you raised with particular emphasis and passion during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not speak about defence. Some of you took what I said negatively, as though I were attaching priority to the sword rather than to the budget or the currency. The facts, though, are very plain: it is difficult to build a new, serviceable edifice without giving it a defensive structure. It will take time: I am aware of the Commission's limitations, I am aware of its powers. I am aware of all of this, but we must make it an objective on a par with foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fight against poverty and marginalisation and the problem of growth. Once again, let us not try to build the future using outdated economic concepts. It is absolutely untrue that the new model of growth will inevitably be harmful to sustainable development and the environment. New growth is totally different from that of the past. The fact is that Europe has not been able to embark with sufficient speed on the road to new growth, which involves above all the following new sectors: software, telecommunications and also, harking back to my last speech, what I referred to as the ‘life sciences'. These encompass major sectors, ranging from pharmaceuticals to fine chemistry to health appliances: sectors in which Europe is extremely weak and has huge scope for job creation and for harnessing intelligence. I would however recall that, in this field more than any other, ethical problems must never come second to economic ones. Let that be clear! This applies not only here; we must make a total, general commitment to this effect because it is part of our overall objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I referred a moment ago to our obligations to the outside world. I have not spoken of these this morning because I did so last time; I regard the two speeches as twin episodes in a single chapter which we must write together. That is why I did not specifically go into the problem of the Mediterranean this morning, but dwelt above all on the Balkans. I would however stress that our responsibility towards the Mediterranean countries is immense. It is immense because the situation confronting us is becoming increasingly difficult and almost untenable socially, economically and especially in regard to the organisation of government structures. No one else can perform this role, and we cannot possibly refuse it now. I merely wished to recall these points over and above what I said in my previous speech, in view of your objections and suggestions, for which I am most grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to close with another very brief remark concerning Kosovo. Our task here is increasingly enormous. Let us remember that the political, social and economic reconstruction of the Balkans will to a large extent, if not exclusively, fall to Europe. Let us remember that we must provide an institutional framework enabling these peoples to feel secure and allowing them not only to maintain their own structures but also to step up their relations with Europe, so as to have their own prospects for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I thank you and I hope that our discussions will continue to be constructive.</p>
