<p>The Commission is asking the European Union to approve target figures for cutting CO2 emissions.

The Chair of the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy says that Europe believes it can achieve this target and hopes for a global agreement.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The European Union and its Member States are committed to an independent quantified economy-wide emissions reduction target of 20% by 2020, compared to 1990 levels. The European Council of December 2009, reaffirming the EU's commitment to a negotiating process leading to a post-2012 legally-binding international agreement, underlined that this target could be increased to 30% provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>
<p>For the moment, and taking into account the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen in December 2009, known as the ‘Copenhagen Accord’, the conditions set out by the European Union to move to a 30% reduction commitment have not yet been met.</p>
<p>In this context, and as clarified in its letter of 28 January 2010 to the UNFCCC Executive Secretary expressing their willingness to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, the EU and its Member States reaffirmed their commitment to achieve 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 as well as the conditional offer to move to a 30% reduction by 2020 compared to 1990, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions and that developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>
<p>The EU remains committed to play a leading role in international climate negotiations on a post 2012 regime.</p>
<p>The Council is in a process of assessing further the Copenhagen outcome. We all need to review and evaluate the recent negotiations and identify ways for overcoming the revealed obstacles between the key actors. In this regard an analysis by the Commission will be a major contribution to our reflection.</p>
<p>A continuation of the dialogue with our international partners at all levels will play a crucial role in keeping the momentum in international climate negotiations.</p>
<p>The European Parliament will be kept informed at all stages of the process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0018"></a>

<p>In November 2009, the Council reviewed the situation in Belarus. Due to the absence of tangible progress in the areas identified in the Council Conclusions of October 2008, the Council was not able to lift the restrictive measures in place against certain officials of Belarus. Therefore, it decided to extend until October 2010 the restrictive measures provided for by Common Position 2006/276 CFSP, as extended by Common Position 2009/314/CFSP.</p>
<p>However, in order to encourage progress in the areas identified by the EU, the Council decided at the same time to extend the suspension of the application of the travel restrictions imposed on certain officials of Belarus.</p>
<p>The European Union reaffirmed its readiness to deepen its relations with Belarus in light of further developments in Belarus towards democracy, human rights and the rule of law and to assist the country in attaining these objectives. Subject to progress in Belarus in these areas, the Council stands ready to take steps towards upgrading contractual relations with Belarus. Meanwhile, the Council invited the Commission to make a proposal for a joint interim plan to set priorities for reforms, inspired by the Action Plans developed in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, to be implemented with Belarus.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0021"></a>

In its programme the Spanish Presidency has promised to defend the rights of the disabled, but has not put forward any specific measure or initiative regarding access to the labour market and continued employment for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>How will the Council ensure that people with disabilities will be able to find and keep a job, bearing in mind not least that 2010 has been declared the ‘European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion’? If they were granted even a limited amount of aid, millions of disabled Europeans could enter the labour market and become independent citizens who would no longer suffer discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Employment policy is a field where long-term measures are essential. By taking measures in line with the competences defined in the Treaties, the Council seeks to play an active part in ensuring that persons with disabilities can participate in the labour market on an equal footing with others.</p>
<p>The Council has in particular consistently underlined the importance of promoting access to employment for persons with disabilities in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, including the current Employment Guidelines.</p>
<p>In a Resolution of March 2008 the Council invited the Member States and the Commission to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities, including by enhancing labour market participation.</p>
<p>More recently, in its conclusions of 30 November 2009 on ‘Promoting labour market inclusion’ the Council reaffirmed its commitment to the integration of disadvantaged groups into the labour market in the context of the economic crisis and the forthcoming EU 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008, the Council and the European Parliament decided jointly to designate the year 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Priorities for this European Year include eradicating disadvantages in education and training, including digital literacy training and promoting equal access for all to ICT, with particular focus on the needs of disabled people and addressing the needs of people with disabilities and their families, as well as other groups or persons in vulnerable situations.</p>
<p>At the opening of the conference which took place in Madrid last January, the Spanish Presidency expressed its commitment to focus on those groups at the greatest risk of exclusion, including persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>While Non-discrimination has been enshrined by the Treaty of Lisbon amongst the objectives of the Union, already ten years ago, the Council played an active part in ensuring that persons with disabilities could participate in the labour market on an equal footing with others by adopting Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. This directive prohibited discrimination on several grounds, including disability, in the field of employment and occupation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0026"></a>

<p>Consumer protection against personal data breaches and spam is a key priority in the new telecoms rules, which the European Parliament and the Council agreed upon at the end of last year. With the aim to urge operators to act responsibly with the processing and storing of personal information of their customers, these new rules introduce mandatory notifications for personal data breaches, i.e. communications providers are obliged to inform the authorities and their customers about security breaches affecting their personal data.</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. The European legal framework on the protection of personal data consists in particular of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, which, concerning the processing of personal data in general, lays down substantive provisions imposing obligations on data controllers and recognising rights of data subjects. The ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002 as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC sets out the rules and safeguards to be observed when processing personal data and other sensitive information in the context of the provision of electronic communication services. Moreover, the directive has provisions on implementation and enforcement in order to ensure the compliance to the rules. It also prescribes sanctions and remedies in cases of breaches and establishes mechanisms to ensure effective enforcement.</p>
<p>Ensuring the security of software programmes, such as Internet explorer, is primarily the responsibility of the commercial providers of such programmes. In the context of the new telecoms rules, Member states are invited to encourage the provision of information to end-users about available precautions, and should encourage them to take the necessary steps to protect their terminal equipment against viruses and spyware.</p>
<p>The Council, in its conclusions of 7 December 2009, noted its priority to strengthening EU action on the relationship between freedom of expression and new technologies. Within the framework of the human rights defenders guidelines, the Council has given added attention to promoting work on human rights in countries upholding undue restrictions on the Internet and other new technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0027"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Despite substantial progress, the Council was unable to reach political agreement on this issue in December 2009. The discussions in the Council focused mainly on the reimbursement of costs with regard to non-contractual healthcare providers and to pensioners living abroad. In the search for a compromise, the intention was to respect fully the case law of the European Court of Justice while preserving Member States' rights to organise their own healthcare systems.</p>
<p>The 18-month programme of the Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies states that the work on cross-border healthcare will continue in the Council. Moreover, the Spanish Presidency has already confirmed to the European Parliament on 26 January 2010 that it remains committed to make every effort to obtain an agreement in the Council.</p>
<p>The aim of the Presidency is that the Directive on cross-border healthcare should be founded on the common values and principles that the Council declared in June 2006 as underpinning the EU Health systems. On this basis, patients going abroad for healthcare should have all the guarantees on the quality and safety of the healthcare they will receive independently of the Member State of treatment and the type of healthcare provider.</p>
<p>As the previous Presidencies, the Spanish Presidency's objective is to find solutions that would strike a right balance between the rights of the patients in cross-border healthcare and the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. In addition, the Directive should supplement the rights that patients already have at the EU level through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes.</p>
<p>In order to succeed, the Council counts on the support of the new Commission in order to reach an agreement during its meeting on 8 June 2010. This should allow for the second reading in the EP in order to have this Directive adopted as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0033"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The situation in Haiti and in particular the extreme vulnerability of children following the earthquake on 12 January 2010 is a matter of serious concern for the Council.</p>
<p>The challenge is huge. Even before the earthquake, there were an estimated 380,000 unaccompanied or orphaned children in Haiti. Following the devastating earthquake, the number of children who have been left unaccompanied, with a sole living parent or orphaned has risen to approximately one million.</p>
<p>The situation of orphans and other vulnerable children in Haiti was raised at the most recent Foreign Affairs Council on 25 January 2010. Particular attention was drawn to the need to ensure that appropriate assistance was given to children, particularly those orphaned by the disaster.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all but one Member State are contracting parties to the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The aim of the Convention is to establish minimum standards in this field. While making the rights and interests of the child paramount, it also respects and protects the rights of families of origin and adoptive families. It is up to the Member States to ensure the proper implementation of the Convention in relation to Haitian children.</p>
<p>The issue of the adoption of children is primarily an issue for individual Member States. However, combined EU efforts towards combating trafficking in human beings have recently been stepped up. On 30 November 2009, the Council agreed on an ‘Action Oriented Paper (AOP) on strengthening the EU external dimension on action against trafficking in human beings; Towards Global EU Action against Trafficking in Human Beings’<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It addresses the external dimension of trafficking by strengthening partnerships with third countries, regions and international organisations. This Action Oriented Paper provides a consolidated framework for the EU and its member States on countering trafficking in human beings, including an integrated compendium of external actions, as well as cooperation measures addressing the root causes of human trafficking in the countries of origin. As such, it can certainly be applied to the situation in Haiti.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to follow closely the situation in Haiti, in coordination with the UN, the Member States and the Commission services active on the spot.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council regrets that the Tegucigalpa/San José Agreement was not fully implemented ahead of the elections on 29 November 2009. This position was very clearly expressed in a declaration issued by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 3 December 2009. On the other hand, the Council considers that the elections are a significant step forward in resolving the crisis and that Honduras should be encouraged to continue on this path.</p>
<p>Since the elections in November, the EU has called upon all actors, including President elect Lobo, to seek a dialogue in order to reach national reconciliation and to re-establish constitutional and democratic order in the country, expecting them to assume their full responsibility in this regard.</p>
<p>The signature on 20 January 2010 of the Agreement of National Reconciliation and Strengthening of Democracy by Mr. Lobo and all the other presidential candidates, which takes on board the core elements of the Tegucigalpa/San José Agreement, and foresees the adequate and honourable solution for President Zelaya's status that the EU has been asking for (Mr. Zelaya himself has accepted) is an important first step forward. This is why, on 27 January, after President Lobo's inauguration, the High Representative issued a declaration on behalf of the EU urging him to promptly translate into action the initiatives mentioned in that agreement, and especially the establishment of the Truth Commission. The EU hopes that these conditions will be implemented rapidly in order to open the way for a swift normalization of relations with Honduras.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, the EU has expressed its deep concern over reported human rights violations in the country (including threats to human rights defenders, arbitrary detentions and repression of peaceful protesters) and has reminded the de facto government of its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the OAS charter and the American Convention on Human Rights. The EU continues to insist that all actors promote and respect the rule of law, good governance and human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0038"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the view expressed by the honourable Member that Haiti is facing a tragedy of unprecedented magnitude. The earthquake of 12 January caused massive loss of life and devastation, adding to the already fragile situation of the country.</p>
<p>The EU and its Member States have taken the measure of the disaster and have responded quickly and efficiently from the very first days after the earthquake. An extraordinary session of the Foreign Affairs Council was convened by High Representative Ashton on 18 January and agreed a very substantial initial EU response, including significant financial assistance. <a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>On 25 January, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to respond positively to the specific request from the UN for additional support for transport and delivery of humanitarian aid and for the action of MINUSTAH to ensure adequate security on the ground. This accounts for the provision of engineering expertise and equipment to open routes to facilitate aid, a maritime logistic capability which can operate without port facilities and a collective EU contribution to reinforce MINUSTAH's police capability, including the contribution by those Member States that are part of the European Gendarmerie Force.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware, however, of any attempts to use humanitarian aid in such a way as described by the honourable Member. From the outset, the EU has welcomed the global response to this crisis and strongly supported the central and coordinating role of the United Nations in the international relief effort. The EU has also stressed that aid and further reconstruction efforts should be needs based and owned by Haitian authorities.</p>
<p>Participants at the ‘Friends of Haiti’ meeting in Montreal on 25 January, including the EU and the US amongst others, recognised the continued leadership and sovereignty of the government of Haiti and reiterated their commitment to a coordinated, coherent and comprehensive approach to meeting Haiti's immediate and longer-term needs. As far as the Council is concerned these principles will doubtless continue to guide the EU's own policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU and US are each other main economic partners and account for the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world. This relationship accounts for some 14 million jobs. As both the EU and US seek to return to sustainable growth, it is essential that they hold the line against the rise of protectionism and resist raising barriers to trade and investment that is especially important in the present economic situation. As part of this approach, the Council is committed to implementing the agreements reached at the last US-EU Summit on 3 November 2009.</p>
<p>To help boost economic growth and job creation in the transatlantic market, the Council will help give strategic direction to the EU-US Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), in particular through developing compatible approaches to regulation in key sectors including labelling, energy efficiency and nanotechnology; assessing regulatory cooperation approaches, including mutual recognition agreements; examining the use of voluntary standards in support of regulation; cooperating on secure trade and international property rights; and establishing a new US-EU innovation dialogue.</p>
<p>The Council will also continue to support transatlantic financial regulatory cooperation, notably through the Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue, which addresses regulatory reforms that are substantially compatible. It will also seek to preserve the integrity of the financial system, promote free and fair competition, ensure robust consumer and investor protection and reduce or eliminate opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The Council will act both in bilateral discussions with the US and in multilateral fora, notably the G20 process.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council will continue to strive for the conclusion of the second stage EU-US aviation agreement in 2010. This agreement alone could bring gains of some eighty thousand jobs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0043"></a>

<p>Given the increasingly adverse weather conditions across Europe in recent months and the damage that this has caused to homes, businesses and agriculture, the European Solidarity Fund has been the subject of much attention and questioning.</p>
<p>The Commission and Parliament have presented the Council with a proposal for a new Solidarity Fund Regulation, one important aspect of which is to lower the threshold for so-called major disasters to 0.5% of GNI or EUR 1 billion in 2007 prices, whichever is lower (under the current Fund 0.6% of GNI or EUR 3 billion in 2002 prices).</p>
<p>Importantly, the proposal also provides for the possibility to grant advance payments of aid to a disaster-stricken country upon its request - a facility that would be greatly welcomed by affected areas in the time immediately following a disaster.</p>
<p>Can the Council give an indication as to when it anticipates dealing with this proposal, particularly in light of the growing importance of this fund?

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council cannot give an indication as to when it anticipates dealing with this proposal for two reasons:</p>
<p>A) The proposal referred to which the honourable Member refers raised a number of concerns among Member States. Indeed, from the very beginning of the discussions, a large number of delegations opposed every significant element of the proposal - the enlarged scope, the reduced thresholds and the political criteria. It is difficult to see how any progress can be made on the basis of the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p>B) On 22 July 2008 the Council adopted conclusions based on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 3/2008 which examined how rapid, efficient and flexible the European Union Solidarity Fund was between 2002 and 2006. In these conclusions the Council stressed that it saw no need at that stage for a Revision of the Regulation.</p>
<p>That being said, the Spanish Presidency intends to ensure the early adoption of the Decision establishing the arrangements for the implementation of the solidarity clause referred to in Article 222 of the Treaty on the functioning of the EU, once the Council receives a joint proposal by the Commission and the High Representative in accordance with Article 222 TFEU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0045"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As indicated in the declaration issued by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 3 December 2009, the EU regrets that the Tegucigalpa/San José Agreement was not fully implemented ahead of the elections on 29 November 2009. Nevertheless, the EU considers the elections a significant step in resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>The signature on 20 January 2010 of the Agreement of National Reconciliation and Strengthening of Democracy by Mr Lobo and all the other presidential candidates is an important first step. The Agreement takes on board the core elements of the Tegucigalpa/San José Agreement, and foresees the adequate and honourable solution for President Zelaya's status that the EU has been asking for (and which Mr. Zelaya himself has accepted). On 27 January, following President Lobo's inauguration, the HR issued a declaration on behalf of the EU urging him to put into effect rapidly the initiatives mentioned in that agreement, and especially the establishment of the Truth Commission. The EU hopes that these conditions will be promptly implemented in order to make possible the swift normalization of the relations with Honduras, thus paving the way for the resumption of negotiations of an Association Agreement between the EU and Central America.</p>
<p>The EU remains committed to give its support to the reestablishment of constitutional and democratic order, and to the process of national reconciliation, in Honduras.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0047"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As far as financial services policy is concerned, the European Council, at its meeting in December 2009, concluded that there was a need for broad-based exit strategies, on the basis of a coordinated approach. It also welcomed the Commission’s intention to closely monitor the implementation of sound remuneration principles, and invited the financial sector to immediately implement sound compensation practices.</p>
<p>Negotiations are currently underway on a number of important legislative proposals to improve regulation and governance in the financial services sector. These include a new structure for financial supervision in Europe, amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive and a draft Directive on alternative investment fund managers, which should also address the issue of appropriate remuneration policies. We welcome the Commission's intention to present legislative proposals in 2010 to improve the stability and transparency of derivative markets.</p>
<p>As regards taxation policy it should be noticed that harmonisation levels vary from very intensive harmonisation of indirect taxation by means of directives on Value Added Tax, excise duties (on alcohol, tobacco and mineral oils) and energy taxation, to less intensive harmonisation of direct taxes specifically focused on the elimination of double taxation of intra-group dividends (Parent-Subsidiary Directive), interest and royalties (Interest and Royalties Directive) and on facilitation of cross-border mergers (Merger Directive).</p>
<p>In addition, EU legislation has sought to improve mutual assistance and cooperation between tax administrations by means of directives on savings taxation and on assessment and recovery of tax claims in the area of direct taxation, VAT and excise duties. Particular attention is paid to cooperation between Member States in the fight against tax fraud.</p>
<p>In the area of direct taxation work on good governance in tax matters is continuing, and in particular:</p>
<p>in intra Union situations, by striving to reach an agreement on amendments to the Savings Taxation Directive and on the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the field of tax assessment;</p>
<p>in external relations, by negotiating an Anti-fraud agreement with Liechtenstein and giving a mandate for the Commission to negotiate anti-fraud agreements with other third countries (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Switzerland).</p>
<p>In the area of indirect taxation and as regards the fight against VAT fraud, EUROFISC, a proposed decentralised network for the exchange of information on VAT fraud among Member States will have an increasingly important role to play. In the field of VAT, the Council is already working on a proposal for a Directive on VAT electronic invoicing rules, an important element of administrative simplification and cost reduction for businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important that progress be made in the modification of a framework for the taxation of energy products on the basis of environmental criteria and the Council is ready to work on the future Commission proposals in this area.</p>
<p>It is, of course, for the Commission to present any proposals to the Council and the European Parliament as regards financial or taxation policy at the European Union level, to be dealt with under the procedures laid down by the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0048"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The meeting the honourable Member is referring to concerns the Advisory Forum of the European Food Safety Agency. This is a platform that connects EFSA with the national food safety authorities of all 27 EU Member States, whereby each Member State is represented by the national body responsible for risk assessment. The EFSA's Advisory Forum meets regularly (4 to 5 times a year), each time in a different EU Member State. Next meeting, the 35th, will take place in Seville, on 11-12 February.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the agenda of the Advisory Forum meeting is prepared by the EFSA itself and not by the Presidency. To the best of our knowledge, food supplements are not on the agenda of the Sevilla meeting of 11 and 12 February 2010. Given the nature of this meeting, the Presidency cannot at this stage make comments about the outcome.</p>
<p>As for the scientific studies carried out by EFSA to establish upper intake levels of the vitamins and the minerals listed in Annex I of Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements, Parliament and the Council decided in Article 5 of Directive 2002/46/EC that such levels are to be established, subject to scientific risk assessment, through comitology procedure with scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Commission conducted extensive public consultations in 2006 to prepare a draft proposal. Member States' and interested stakeholders' views received by the Commission in response to its discussion paper can be consulted at the Commission public web site<a href="#defann_16_2" name="refann_16_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council understands that the Commission is now working on the impact assessement to finalise the draft proposal which will be presented to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and then to the European Parliament and the Council for scrutiny as set out in Article 5a of Council Decision of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member has raised a particularly important topical issue.</p>
<p>President Obama has called for the introduction in the USA of a financial responsibility levy, which aims to recoup the aid provided by the US government through the rescue arrangements during the crisis and to strengthen public finances. Moreover, on 21 January 2010, President Obama announced initiatives to limit the scope of activities financial institutions can undertake and ban banks from activities which are seen as primarily speculative risks.</p>
<p>This represents a major policy move in respect of the current G-20 and Financial Stability Board debates, which are focused on regulatory and supervisory repair.</p>
<p>Discussions in relation to the US plans have not yet started in the Council, not least because they still need to be fleshed out by the US Administration, in particular the US Treasury, and in Congress.</p>
<p>Against this background, it would not be appropriate to prejudge the views of the Council on this issue, or to speculate on the possible outcome of the extraordinary European Council meeting of 11 February. Nevertheless, the Council takes notes of recent US initiatives, still at an early stage of development, as a sign of reinforce commitment of the US Administration to address the accumulation of risks in the financial system and to deal with moral hazard. It should be noted, however, that these initiatives come on top of a wider set of regulatory instruments which are currently under review by international bodies such as the BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision), the FSB or the IMF. The EU is actively contributing to this international debate aimed to address global concerns on a common and coordinated basis. In this vein, we are pushing for solutions that ensure, first of all, that excessive risk taking policies are avoided on a preventive basis, in order to address, among others, the too big to fail problem or the accumulation of systemic risks in certain financial markets or agents. The development of strengthened capital requirements or liquidity regulation are some of the solutions the EU is fully supporting. On the second hand, the EU is also committed to promoting solutions which ensure that the financial sector asumes part of the cost of the financial repair in case of crisis, e.g. through private sector crisis-management funds or insurance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the honourable Member knows, the Council's approach to limiting risk on financial markets is also focused on the strengthening of the financial supervisory framework. On 20 March 2009, and conducted in the light of the report of the ‘High level group on financial supervision in the EU’ of 25 February 2009 (the de Larosière report), the European Council agreed on the need to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in the EU and concluded that the report from the High Level Group on financial supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière was the basis for action.</p>
<p>The Commission subsequently presented five proposals concerning the creation of a new financial supervision mechanism in the EU, in particular through macro and micro financial supervision, for which work is ongoing both in the Council and in the European Parliament. The Council is looking forward to the early adoption this year of the financial supervision reform package, which is currently the subject of negotiations between our two institutions with a view to a first reading agreement.</p>
<p>This new legislation should permit the newly created European Systemic Risk Board and the European Supervisory Authorities to boost the monitoring of risks and their timely mitigation through better informed and coordinated supervisory action.</p>
<p>In addition, other aspects of the roadmap laid down in the de Larosière report are being addressed. This includes the issue of remuneration in the proposal presented by the Commission on 13 July 2009 to modify the Capital Requirement Directive. The aim of this Directive is, inter alia, to bring the remuneration arrangements of banks and investment firms within prudential oversight in order to oblige credit institutions and investment firms to have remuneration policies that are consistent with effective risk management. The Council reached a general approach on a text in December, and the Council now intends to do its utmost to work towards an agreement with the European Parliament so that this directive can be adopted as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0010"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the introduction of the European Citizens' initiative which will give a stronger voice to the European Union citizens, add a new dimension to European democracy and complement the set of rights related to the citizenship of the Union.</p>
<p>Given the legal, administrative and practical issues that are raised by the new European Citizens' Initiative, introduced by Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union, and its importance for citizens, stakeholders and public authorities in the Member States, the Commission published a Green Paper on 11 November 2009 in order to seek the views of all interested parties on the key issues that will shape the future Regulation. Stakeholders had until 31st January 2010 to respond to the consultation.The replies to this Green Paper, as well as Parliament's resolution on the Citizens' initiative adopted in May 2009, will serve as basis for the preparation of the Commission's proposal for a Regulation,.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that European citizens should benefit from the European Citizens' Initiative as quickly as possible. To that end, it will put forward shortly a proposal for a Regulation on the basis of Article 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Commission's ambition would be to make it possible for the Regulation to be adopted before the end of the first year after the entry into force of the Treaty and it trusts that the European Parliament and Council will share this objective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0013"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Court judgment to which the honourable Member refers<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in addition to Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), with regard to any gender discrimination that may arise from differences in pension entitlement between men and women, concerns the pension scheme administered by the Istituto nazionale della previdenza per i dipendenti dell’amministrazione pubblica (INPDAP) and covers pensions of officials and other staff working in the civil service. According to the contentious provisions, retirement was set at 60 for women and at 65 for men. In its judgment, the Court confirmed that a pension paid by an employer (which may also be the State) to a former staff member by reason of an 'employment relationship' constitutes pay within the meaning of Article 153 TFEU. The Court thus confirmed that civil servants are to be considered ‘workers’ in this context. As a consequence, the INPDAP pension scheme, and in particular the rules on pensionable age, must observe the principle of equal treatment. This case-law was confirmed by the Court recently in a case concerning a difference in pensionable age for Greek officials<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In its judgment in Case C-46/07, however, the Court did not address the question of how any difference in pension entitlements due to a difference in pensionable age in the past was to be remedied.</p>
<p>In Cases C-408/92 and C-28/93<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Court stated that once discrimination in relation to pay was found to exist, ‘so long as measures for bringing about equal treatment have not been adopted by the scheme, the only proper way of complying with Article [141 EC] is to grant to the persons in the disadvantaged class the same advantages as those enjoyed by the persons in the favoured class.’</p>
<p>It went on to say that ‘Application of this principle […] means that, as regards the period between 17 May 1990 (the date of the Barber judgment) and 1 July 1991 (the date on which discrimination was ended) the pension rights of men must be calculated on the basis of the same retirement age as that for women.’ Settled case-law confirms the Court’s position on this point.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission is closely following developments in Italian legislation in observance of the Court’s judgment, and will take action where Italy, or any other Member State with similar problems, fails to comply.</p>
<p>As regards any discriminatory agreements concluded by certain organisations and trade unions in the Member States as referred to by the honourable Member, it is, in principle, for the national courts to determine whether such agreements comply with European law. However, in conformity with Article 288 TFEU, the end responsibility for the correct transposition and application of EU legislation remains with the Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides a legal basis for proposing minimum social standards in a number of fields but not for legislation to achieve the specific objective of combating social exclusion.</p>

Its aim is to achieve an effective holistic approach to the fight against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently putting considerable effort into developing a monitoring framework for the Active Inclusion Strategy. This involves work, in conjunction with Member State representatives to the Social Protection Committee, to identify a suitable set of indicators for monitoring the Strategy’s implementation.

The Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2010<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and its accompanying Supporting Document<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> include a section on minimum income schemes for poor working-age people, identifying critical points in the design of national social safety nets, mainly in terms of coverage of the needy population and failure of individuals entitled to social assistance benefits to take them up. Mutual learning and exchanges of best practice involving projects and peer reviews linked to active inclusion are under way and will continue under the Open Method of Coordination in social protection and social inclusion.</p>

<p>(EN) The announcement by the President of Iceland of a referendum on the IceSave bill testifies to the sensitive nature of the issue for the country. This is a matter for the people of Iceland to decide. The Commission is following the situation closely. It does not wish to interfere in such a national debate.</p>
<p>The Commission considers the IceSave agreement, i.e. the loan agreements between the UK, the NL and Iceland and the terms and conditions for the repayment of these loans, as a bilateral issue between these countries. As such, these agreements are not linked to the Commission's mandate to prepare an opinion on Iceland's accession application and should neither be linked directly to Iceland's accession process.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently drafting its opinion on Iceland's membership application as requested by the Council and is seeking to ensure that it is balanced, objective and comprehensive.</p>
<p>The opinion assesses the level of fulfilment of the accession Copenhagen criteria. In this context, issues like IceSave and capital controls will be referred to through the lens of Iceland's capacity to apply the acquis. As appropriate, references will be made to Iceland's compliance with the European Economic Area (EEA) as evaluated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA). In case of non compliance, the identified gaps will then have to be filled so that Iceland fully complies with the acquis by the date of accession.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to underline in this context that the opinion will only give an initial picture of the level of implementation of the acquis by Iceland. The Commission will provide a more detailed assessment at a later stage of the accession process, e.g. through the so-called 'screening' of the EU acquis, once the Council has decided on opening of accession negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0022"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is in a permanent dialogue with Member States, international partners and international organisations to exchange and develop aviation security measures. It chairs a standing regulatory committee established by EU aviation security legislation that meets periodically several times a year<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and if necessary ad-hoc in order to react on pending issue. Furthermore the Commission exchanges views with stakeholders at regular intervals. Up-dating of existing legislation to reply to new developments is common and has happened at several occasions during recent years.</p>
<p>EU airports can only use screening equipment that is listed in and further described by EU legislation on aviation security. In principle, screening equipment, for example explosive trace detection (‘bomb sniffing’), must follow detailed performance and operating principles, where available. In order to achieve one-stop-security within the EU, airports must apply common basic aviation security standards.</p>
<p>The attempted terrorist attack on flight NW 253 to Detroit on 25th December has again confirmed the reality of the threat against civil aviation. At different levels the Commission is participating in the evaluation and possible follow-up to the incident.</p>
<p>More stringent measures applied by some Member States unilaterally allowed under EU law. The Commission considers however that a more sustainable way forward, with common standards at EU level, is required. Adding new detection technologies such as advanced imaging technology to the list of permitted equipment may be one element, provided that concerns related to health, privacy and data protection can be dealt with in a satisfactory manner. However, other measures, such as more in-depth cooperation of law enforcement services and more efficient exchange of available data are equally needed.</p>

<p>On 13 January 2010 in La Granja, Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, debated the concept of the citizens' initiative with the other Member States. The Member States agreed that 'a significant number of Member States' should mean one third of the Member States (at present, therefore, nine of them).</p>
<p>The 'one seat' initiative, calling for the European Parliament to be based solely in Brussels, clearly complies with the above criteria (at least one million signatures from at least nine Member States).

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the introduction of the European Citizens' initiative which will give a stronger voice to the European Union citizens, add a new dimension to European democracy and complement the set of rights related to the citizenship of the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that European citizens should benefit from the European Citizens' Initiative as quickly as possible. To that end, it will put forward shortly a proposal for a Regulation on the basis of Article 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The proposal will take into account the outcome of the public consultation that the Commission launched in November 2009, to seek the views of citizens, stakeholders and public authorities in the Member States. The Commission's ambition would be to make it possible for the Regulation to be adopted before the end of the first year after the entry into force of the Treaty and it trusts that the European Parliament and Council will share this objective.</p>
<p>A European Citizens' Initiative, within the meaning of Article 11(4) of the Treaty on European Union (TUE), can invite the Commission to submit a proposal only within the framework of its powers and on a matter where a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties.</p>
<p>The seat of the institutions of the Union is determined by common accord of the governments of the Member States in accordance with Article 341 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFUE).

<p>(EN) The honourable Member is correct in saying that the current financial and economic crisis has had an effect on the ‘Rail Baltica’ project, as it has on many major infrastructure projects throughout the EU Member States.

In Lithuania the Commission has suggested an alternative scheme to implement the project, which while it would be less costly and easier and faster to implement, would not undermine the benefits which a completed ‘Rail Baltica’ would give to the partner countries. This suggested amendment to the project was agreed by the Lithuanian authorities in December 2009.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the various consumer problems raised by the honourable Member in connection with car hire.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently looking at the problem of geographical market segmentation in retail of goods and services in order to determine its magnitude in practice. The recent Commission Report on cross-border e-commerce in the EU<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> as well the Communication on the same subject adopted by the Commission in October 2009<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, give a first analysis of these problems as well as of actions that the Commission intend to take to address them. The Commission believes that harmonised consumer protection rules across the EU will enable traders (including car hire companies) to contract with consumers in different Member States using one set of standard terms and conditions. Consumers will in turn benefit from more competitive cross-border offers. In the car hire market, further harmonization of consumer rights might result in lower drop-off fees.</p>
<p>For those reasons, the Commission has tabled the Proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights which is currently being discussed in the Council and the Parliament. This Proposal revises the main elements of the EU consumer protection legislation. It is based on the principle of full harmonisation, which will streamline the current patchwork of different consumer laws into a single simple set of rules.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is already EU Legislation which addresses some of the consumer problems mentioned by the honourable Member. The honourable Member refers to various practices that could result in different treatment applied by the same car rental service provider on grounds of the place of residence of their customers.</p>
<p>These differences are dealt with specifically by Article 20, paragraph 2 of the Services Directive<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. According to this provision ‘Member States shall ensure that the general conditions of access to a service, which are made available to the public at large by the provider, do not contain discriminatory provisions relating to the nationality or place of residence of the recipients’. This provision also specifies that not all differences in treatment are forbidden since differences in the conditions of access will be allowed ‘when those differences are directly justified by objective criteria’. As clarified in Recital 95 of the Services Directive, objective justifications could be, for example, additional costs incurred because of the distance involved or the technical characteristics of the provision of the service or extra risks linked to rules differing in different countries.</p>
<p>The Services Directive had to be implemented by Member States by 28 December 2009 at the latest. Further to the implementation of the Services Directive behaviours of car rental service providers that may result in different treatment according to the nationality or the place of residence of consumers should be analysed under national provisions implementing Article 20, paragraph 2 of the Services Directive. Differences in treatment will only be lawful if traders demonstrate that these differences are ‘directly based on objective criteria’.</p>
<p>In addition, the Unfair Contract Terms Directive<a href="#defann_27_4" name="refann_27_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> may also be relevant for some of the situations mentioned by the honourable Member. The Unfair Contract Terms Directive applies to the standard terms and conditions that are usually attached to the contract concluded between the car hire company and the consumer. Under the Directive when contract terms cause significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand, and of sellers and suppliers on the other hand, they shall be regarded as unfair. It may be argued that restrictive contract terms of insurance policies are unfair. Unfair terms used in a contract shall not be binding on the consumer.</p>
<p>Moreover, this Directive obliges the trader to draft and present his standard terms and conditions (e.g. those of the insurance policy) in plain and intelligible language. Contract terms, which do not meet these requirements, could also be considered unfair and, therefore, not binding on the consumer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In their guidance on pandemic preparedness, the Commission and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) emphasised the need to prepare primary and secondary care services (whether public or private) for surges in patients.</p>
<p>The surveillance data reported by countries through the European Influenza Surveillance Network shows that the pressure from influenza like illness or acute respiratory infections experienced in primary care at the national level during the pandemic was not that extreme compared to, for example, last season’s seasonal influenza though it came earlier in the season as Member States had been warned to expect. Partly, this was thanks to the good preparations made by the Member States. However, as highlighted in the ECDC risk-assessments, it was unexpected that there would be such selective pressure on intensive care services (primarily for respiration).</p>
<p>In recent days, criticism has been voiced on the money that was spent on pandemic influenza vaccines and on the alleged influence of the pharmaceutical industry in public health policy making. The decisions by Member States on whether to buy pandemic influenza vaccines and how much vaccine to buy are a Member State competence. The Commission was not involved in these decisions and neither is the Commission privy to the contractual arrangements between the Member States and the pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturers. The declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) triggered the execution of existing contracts the pharmaceutical industry had with Member States for supply of pandemic influenza vaccines. WHO has confirmed at several occasions that the declaration of a pandemic was not biased by any profit-driven influence. Likewise, the Commission does not have any elements to believe that the Member States' decisions were biased by such influence. On the contrary, several Member States asked the Commission to set up a mechanism to help with joint procurement of vaccines in order to reduce costs. The Commission and the two independent European Agencies ECDC and the European Medicines Agency have assisted Member States with regulatory and scientific expertise</p>
<p>The Member States had a very difficult task when needing to decide how many doses of vaccines to purchase without knowing what the ultimate nature of the pandemic would be. At the time the Member States made these decisions, their primary consideration was to protect their citizens in the best possible way against a potentially dangerous pandemic. Therefore, the Commission believes that in hindsight, it is unfair to now second guess the wisdom of these decisions. Finally, one should keep in mind that about 2500 European citizens died because of the H1N1 influenza and many others were severely sick.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0030"></a>

The primary responsibility for the protection of human rights lies with the Eritrean state and concretely, the Commission is working together with the Eritrean authorities on areas where progress can be currently made such as workers rights and the improvement of the justice system, but also, more generally, on the promotion of and spreading of information on basic human rights and fundamental freedoms to the Eritrean population at large. In the Eritrean context such activities can only yield results if undertaken in a phased and incremental manner.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is concerned about the situation of children who were separated from their parents or in alternative care (orphanages) prior to the earthquake. Prevention of the sale and trafficking of children must be a key priority in the response efforts.</p>
<p>It is indeed true, as recalled by UNICEF, that the issue of inter-country adoption is particularly sensitive in the case of children separated from their parents and communities. In a disaster situation, efforts to reunite a displaced child with his or her parents or family members must take priority. Premature and unregulated attempts to organize the adoption of such a child abroad must be avoided.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the removal of children without proper procedures could even give place to the worst forms of trafficking for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation, and therefore must be absolutely forbidden.</p>
<p>The Commission is not competent in individual decisions on internal adoptions. However, to its information it seems that children who have been allowed to entry in Europe by means of inter-country adoption in the days after the disaster were all already been adopted by a European family with a decision of a Haitian Court.</p>
<p>This seems to be in line with the UNICEF's view, as the UNICEF Executive Director, Ms Veneman, said that if the screening for international adoption for some Haitian children had been completed prior to the earthquake, there are clear benefits of speeding up their travel to their new homes.</p>
<p>Twenty-six EU Member States out of 27 are party to the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption (all except Ireland). This establishes safeguards for the child and foresees a system of cooperation between the Contracting Parties to prevent illegal adoptions and child trafficking.</p>
<p>Haiti is not a party to the 1993 Hague Convention. However, in 2000, the Hague Conference adopted a Recommendation to the effect that States parties should, as far as practicable, apply the standards and safeguards of the Convention to the arrangements for inter-country adoption which they make in respect of States that have not yet joined the Convention. More than 80 States, including almost all receiving States, are parties to this Convention. Therefore, even if Haiti is not party to the 1993 Hague Convention, all receiving States should apply these standards and safeguards (included all EU Member States except Ireland).</p>
<p>As part of its emergency humanitarian response, the Commission's Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid has identified protection issues as a focus of its funding strategy, and is seeking to provide financial support to non-governmental organisations, international agencies and organisations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent family working on child protection in Haiti. Though not able to support the government directly, all actions funded will be fully coordinated through the cluster mechanism, which is coordinated by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) in support of the government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0037"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission refers to its previous replies to questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0748_EN.html">H-748/08</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-1944_EN.html">E-1944/08</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-6685_EN.html">E-6685/08</a><a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and confirms that it has followed closely the situation of the wreck of the Sea Diamond off Santorini, in order to ensure proper application of Community law. Having examined the relevant provisions of the applicable legislation (that is, Directive 2004/35/EC<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, Directive 2000/60/EC<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy and Directive 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_33_4" name="refann_33_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on waste), the Commission has concluded that, on account of specific circumstances, it was not possible to establish violation of the provisions in question.</p>
<p>As far as Directive 2004/35/EC is concerned, it does not apply in the present case since the accident in question took place before the application of the directive.</p>
<p>Having regard to the possible violation of Article 4 of Directive 2006/12/EC, it should be recalled that this provision obliges the Member States to ensure that waste is disposed of without endangering human health or the environment; furthermore, the Member States shall take the measures necessary to prohibit the abandonment, dumping and uncontrolled disposal of waste.</p>
<p>Article 4 allows the Member States a margin of appreciation as regards the measures to be taken. According to the case law of the Court<a href="#defann_33_5" name="refann_33_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, the persistance of a factual situation, particularly when it involves significant damage to the environment over a prolonged period without the intervention of the competent authorities, may reveal that the Member States have exceeded the margin of appreciation that this provision gives them.</p>
<p>It was not possible to establish such significant environmental damage over a prolonged period without the intervention of the competent authorities. On the one hand, the Greek authorities took the necessary measures to avoid pollution (impact study on pollution, continuous monitoring of the zone affected). On the other hand, the study by the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research concluded that the effects caused by the wreck are negligible for now.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is not possible to establish violation of Community environmental legislation. If the honourable Member should, however, have new information allowing a case of violation to be established (for example, recent, reliable studies showing that pollution exists), he is invited to communicate them to the Commission.</p>
<p>Moreover, in future, Directive 2009/20/EC<a href="#defann_33_6" name="refann_33_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> on the insurance of shipowners for maritime claims, which entered into force on 29 May 2009 and which must be transposed into the legislation of the Member States by 1 January 2012, obliges the shipowners of ships flying the flag of a Member State or entering the port of a Member State, to have insurance covering maritime claims subject to limitation under the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, as amended by the 1996 Protocol; these claims include those relating to the removal of wrecks.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to monitor the state of the Sea Diamond wreck.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In any humanitarian crisis that demands a food assistance response, the EU provides cash to specialized implementing partners, including the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme. This means that we leave the decision to the experts on what food items are most appropriate for a given response.</p>
<p>This decision also needs to be agreed within the inter-agency framework for coordination of food sector operations.</p>
<p>However, the EU expects such a decision to be based on considerations, amongst others, of: nutritional value; conformity to local dietary preferences; ease of transport, storage and handling and preparation; cost; availability of adequate stocks; and proximity of stocks to the crisis zone.</p>
<p>It is true that processed canned fish can be a valuable and highly nutritious commodity in a food aid package.</p>
<p>In some operations that the EU finances, fish has been included by the implementing partner in the food rations that they distribute, after the above considerations were made.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that in contexts where there is no local or regional production of canned fish, its cost and the effort of transporting it often renders it unfavorable compared to other nutritious food commodities (e.g. beans and pulses).</p>
<p>In the case of the earthquake response in Haiti, the EU is financing the UN's World Food Programme for their immediate response and for their foreseen operation over the coming five months.</p>
<p>This response is based on distribution of food rations that are ready-to-eat, which are being provided in kind by various donors, some of which include canned fish.</p>
<p>For the next phase of the operation, when beneficiaries are better able to prepare their own food, and when bulk distributions of raw commodities to be cooked can be organized, it is expected that the rations will revert to lower-cost local commodities (beans, rice and fortified blended food) that still meet the population's full energy and micro-nutrient requirement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0042"></a>

<p>(EN) Since August 2006, the EU applied a ban on liquids, aerosols and gels on board aircraft<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in order to prevent the bringing on board an aircraft, liquid explosives. This ban was confirmed at global level by recommendations issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and is applied by the most important aviation partners of the EU.</p>
<p>The recent incident on flight NW 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit confirmed that the level of threats against civil aviation remains high. It is thus not an option to allow for the ban on liquids to expire without replacement. The Commission has, therefore, made a proposal to permit liquids to be taken on board aircraft provided they are screened. This proposal, currently under scrutiny by Parliament, aims at delivering a solution to the carriage of liquids on board aircraft as suitable technology for screening liquids becomes available.</p>
<p>As such, the proposal advocates that by 29 April 2011, liquids carried by passengers arriving from outside the EU and transferring through EU airports shall be permitted, subject to screening. Furthermore, as of 29 April 2013 at the latest, all liquids carried by passengers departing from EU airports shall be permitted, again, subject to screening. Overtime performance standards for explosive detection equipment will have to increase in order to remain compliant with EU legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the important economic and social role that banana production plays in the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Madeira, which the Treaty includes among the outermost regions and to which it acknowledges particular disadvantages. For this reason, the Commission continues to support this production and to help producers compete.</p>
<p>In 2006, the EU reformed its Common Market Organisation for bananas. It allocated a generous budget for aid to banana producers in the outermost regions, which it transferred to the POSEI programmes on 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2007.</p>
<p>This reform introduced a high degree of flexibility in the management of support for banana production. Member States have assumed responsibility for it as part of the POSEI programmes. The reform allows Member States to define a fixed annual amount in aid, instead of the previous compensatory aid. This means producers can now be certain of the amounts they will receive.</p>
<p>Since the reform, the EU has committed EUR 280 million each year to support banana producers in the Canaries, the French Antilles, and Madeira, and to a lesser extent in the Azores. This represents a 47% increase of the previous annual budget, which amounted on average to EUR 190 million between 2002 and 2006.</p>
<p>The banana reform took into account the possible impact on European producers of:</p>
<p>- the Economic Partnership Agreements concluded between some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the EU, which had still to be implemented, since they only came into force in 2008 and that entailed duty free/quota free access for bananas;</p>
<p>- the reduction of the import duty on bananas from third countries (Latin American and Andean countries) which was concluded with: the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas (GATB) of 15 December 2009. Although this is an early result for the Doha Round, this tariff reduction is final: there won't be any further cuts.</p>
<p>The banana reform took thus into account the likely impact of these international agreements on European producers and it was concluded with the budgetary increase for the banana producers of outermost regions mentioned before.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Commission believes that the support which banana producers in the outermost regions currently receive is sufficient to protect them from increased competition from third countries which export bananas to the EU and will benefit from gradual cuts in bananas import tariff over the next seven to nine years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0050"></a>

<p>(EN) (1) The Commission shares the underlying goals of the ideas put forward by President Obama, namely to address the risks generated by systemically important financial institutions. To tackle this issue, the Commission is considering a package of measures addressing interconnectedness of institutions and a better crisis management framework, including the introduction of early intervention and resolution tools for supervisors as well as creating more resilient derivatives markets. This builds on measures taken and under discussion to improve the quality of bank capital requirements in particular as concerns trading book operations and risky securitisation products. The new supervisory system the Commission has proposed and which is currently under discussion in Parliament sets the standard for identifying macro-economic risks and ensuring this feeds into effective and joined-up day-to-day supervision of banks operating in Europe.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently awaiting further details on President Obama's proposals. A discussion of the issue of systemically important financial institutions is expected to take place in a forthcoming ECOFIN meeting.
