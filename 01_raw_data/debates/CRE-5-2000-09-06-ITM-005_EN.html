<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of family. Are we talking about nuclear families, legitimate families, extended families, polygamous families, cohabiting families … <span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But ladies and gentlemen, this list is the result of your own interventions. As you have even asked for ‘homosexual’ families to be included, I do not see why you are protesting.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of the chekcs as set out in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Should checks be carried out on the basis of presumption, or on well-founded presumption? Should it be targeted or random? All these definitions must be clarified and that is why, Madam President, I have the honour of tabling this motion for referral to committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that we must keep within the scope of this directive only the refugees who are recognised by the Geneva Convention.

Parliament was divided between supporters of two different solutions. Eventually, a majority was achieved for one of the solutions, a majority which also encompassed the Group of the European United Left. In normal administrative relations, this decision by Parliament would be final; not so in the European Union. A conciliation procedure had to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure between the Council and Parliament resulted in a compromise which is rather noncommittal as long as it is not accompanied by a Commission statement. This statement explains how the Commission interprets the word “substantial” in Article 8 (1). Substantial appears to mean 30% here, but this cannot be made explicit in the text itself. From the outset, there was a battle between a majority which supported 90% and a minority which was in favour of 0%. This has now resulted in a percentage which is nearer to 0 than 90 and which may not be made public. Everyone is now agreed that ship’s waste and cargo residues can no longer be discharged at sea but there is substantial disagreement about how this ship’s waste is to be collected and, more to the point, how this collection should be funded. Around the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, preference was given to funding based on a general levy for each ship. This should prevent anyone from seeking financial gain by not delivering waste at officially designated sites. Around the Mediterranean Sea, however, there was preference for payment according to the waste collected. Instead of developing both systems separately to start with and comparing the respective environmental effects, attempts are now being forced through to arrive at one solution for all. This is prejudicing the northern model. It would be better if, instead of applying an overall EU solution, this matter could be regulated according to which particular sea was involved. Without the European Union, it would have been easier to reach an agreement between groups of separate countries for each sea. In this case, the presence of the European Union is not conducive to finding a joint, cross-border solution. Despite this, my group has voted in favour because this regulation is better than nothing. I hope a review will take place within the next couple of years so that the original intentions of the Bouwman report can be brought to bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, it was a very topical subject, as the debate on marine safety in the wake of the wreck of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was at its fiercest. Today, the debate is calmer, but no less important.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe are deeply concerned about the pollution of the seas and the coastlines of the Member States. The European Parliament echoed these legitimate concerns and amended the directive proposed by the European Commission on the management of waste discharged by ships in such a way as to make Member States aware of their responsibilities. As an alternative to the principle that the polluter pays, which has proved to be ineffective, Parliament suggested establishing a system whereby all ships would pay a fee whenever they called at a port, whether they used the waste disposal facilities or not. This fee would help finance 90% of the cost of these facilities. This system would encourage ships to deliver their ship-generated waste and cargo residues to the port reception facilities rather than discharge them at sea. It was clear that the Council would not accept such a proposal. The discussion was then continued, quite logically, within the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Those negotiating on behalf of Parliament and the Council reached the following agreement: all ships calling at a port of a Member State shall contribute significantly (a statement from the Commission annexed to the text considers that this means at least 30% of the costs), irrespective of actual use of the facilities. The share of the costs which is not covered by that fee, if any, shall be covered on the basis of the types and quantities of ship-generated waste actually offloaded by the ship.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission shall, within three years of the implementation, submit a report evaluating the impact of the variety of cost recovery systems on the marine environment. It will, if necessary in the light of this evaluation, submit a proposal to amend this directive by the introduction of a system involving the payment of an appropriate percentage, of no less than one third of the costs of port reception facilities, by all ships calling at a port of a Member State irrespective of actual use of the facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied with the compromise we have reached. This directive is a significant step in establishing a more effective strategy to protect the marine environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I am not entirely satisfied with the outcome of the conciliation procedure, I nevertheless accept this compromise which, I am bound to say, is to the credit of the European Parliament and to its skill and maturity in dealing with the legislative process of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Aware of the unacceptability of discharging waste at sea and the behaviour of crews who profit from a dramatic accident to discharge their own waste with total impunity, thereby adding to the pollution of the seas, the European Commission proposed focussing its action on installing reception facilities for ship-generated waste in European ports. All ports must be equipped with such facilities and, in addition, all ships calling at one of these ports must pay a fee towards the cost of collecting and treating this waste, irrespective of actual use of the facilities. Parliament took the view that this fee should cover 90% of the cost but, following the compromise reached with the Council, this was reduced to at least 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just a first step. It recognises the polluter-pays principle. It is a necessary step, but it does not go far enough. Let us make no bones about it. If we really want to clean up our oceans and preserve the natural balance for future generations, we must take more radical measures, especially concerning payment for these facilities and the need to avoid distortions in competition between ports. In a word, we must establish a public service for the treatment of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, I can only recommend that Parliament accepts the results of this conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, it is important that a tax is imposed on each ship to cover at least 30% of the cost of these facilities. It is not a question of creating ‘ecological boats’ that are able to treat all their waste at sea, essentially by means of incineration. Such conduct, which cannot realistically be controlled, in fact enables antipollution legislation to be bypassed: allegedly incinerated hydrocarbons and domestic waste are discharged into the sea; there is no selectivity and this only adds to the greenhouse effect.</p>

Unfortunately, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union crumbled under pressure from the Council, which is promoting an unprincipled <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> with the Turkish regime, thereby depriving Turkish citizens of a boost towards democracy, which could be given by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we did not support the amendment aimed at rejecting the Directive, our aim was clearly not to reward those who, in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, had worked on this text for years. We are not here to legitimise the often strange desires of the technocrats in Brussels to legislate on anything and everything. We rejected this amendment because companies need a clear framework within which to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The sticking point is the scope of the directive, that is, the very definition of the ‘plans and programmes’.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandatory part of the scope applies to plans and programmes supporting authorisations for projects in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, waste management, water management, telecommunications, tourism, town and country planning or land use. This mandatory part is supplemented by a selection mechanism, so-called ‘screening’, undertaken on the initiative of the Member States (the non-mandatory part).</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that protecting the environment and taking it into consideration when evaluating policies is a necessity and even an obligation. But the Member States, in the name of subsidiarity, are in a better position to ensure that this is carried out properly. We will not support amendments aimed at enlarging the scope of application of the directive, as it must be limited to the plans and programmes that are likely to have significant repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">How annoying it is when attempts are made on all sides to give greater powers to the European Union at the expense of the Member States. In this case, under the guise of concern for the environment, the rapporteur wants to take charge of all the policies of the Member States. The importance of taking the environment into consideration when evaluating policies is not in doubt, but to apply the same procedure to it, especially one that is imposed by the European Union, is inconceivable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have confidence in the Member States and we defend the common position. The ‘environment’ alibi is nothing more than the instrument the European Union uses to extend its control in all policy areas. We are well aware of the powers of the Union, and we know its arsenal. It uses the environment to infiltrate everywhere; it uses our water pipes to spread its tentacles into national policy. We say no to this. Like a number of other delegations, France has stated clearly that it does want the scope of application to be extended to national policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is written in Agenda 2000. But Europe has a fluid border to the south, conditioned by its geography.</p>
<p class="contents">Boats and rafts arrive along its borders in southern Italy and southern Spain. They are loaded and sometimes overloaded with Albanians, Turks, Muslims – men, women and children from all the countries around the Mediterranean. It is a tidal wave that is going to grow year by year. Europe is going to be submerged, even though at El Elejido in 1999 and in just a few other places, the settled populations have reacted against this flood of nomads.</p>
<p class="contents">Not wanting any roll back and unable to achieve containment, European leaders are logically seeking to prevent these nomads from leaving their home countries. And this is the aim of the common-sense MEDA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Sketched out at the European Summit in Cannes in June 1995, established by the Barcelona Conference of November 1995 in the form of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and implemented by the MEDA Regulation of 23 July 1996, this Mediterranean policy of the European Union is based on a few regional and national investment projects. It is a meagre amount: EUR 3.3 billion from 1995 to 1999, from Morocco to Gaza and the West Bank, even if, by adding to it the EUR 3.6 million in loans from the European Investment Bank, the financial contribution is greater than the EUR 4.4 billion given by the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a meagre amount, not only because, in reality, these EUR 3.6 billion in commitment loans are in fact reduced to a collective payment of just EUR 648 million, but also because this step is not commensurate with the size of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, it is good to have moved from bilateral aid to a global, multilateral approach. Admittedly, for 2000-2006, MEDA II will increase loans of less than 47.1% to arrive at a financial package of EUR 8.5 billion. European farmers would be happy with an increase that was twice, three times less than that.</p>
<p class="contents">But that does not constitute a Mediterranean policy. A Mediterranean policy is not more programmes and more officials in Brussels to manage them. A Mediterranean policy that is up to the demographic, environmental, climatic, Islamic and cultural challenge is a grand strategic vision, establishing, integrating, stabilising and organising the Mediterranean around original and intergovernmental institutions with major common sectors to explore: water, the environment, migration, deforestation and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, and with a method and integrated institutions such as a High Secretariat for the Mediterranean, one can talk of a budget, as there will be strategic projects and not tactical sprinklings of small amounts. But we must act quickly, very quickly, before a colonised Europe has nothing more to share than the decline of peoples who have been deprived of their culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be further developed and deepened. However, the report on the reform of the MEDA programme does not set the right tone on a number of counts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is fixated with the idea of concluding free trade agreements with the southern Mediterranean countries, although, paradoxically, they only have a one-sided liberalising effect. Such agreements have a particularly negative impact on the financially disadvantaged, as existing free trade agreements have shown. The report concedes that free trade agreements carry this risk. Why else would it describe, and call for, support measures, with a view to alleviating the negative impact of free trade?</p>
<p class="contents">If the risks attending the free trade strategy are acknowledged, but it is pursued nevertheless, then the social, environmental and cultural components of the programme will only ever have repair and damage limitation status, when they ought to be the guiding principle for such agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to qualify for subsidies, the MEDA countries must satisfy the Bretton Woods institutions (for example the IMF). These self-same programmes are notorious for having anti-social strategies directed purely at liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the EU-Mediterranean partnership must be to redress the balance between the northern and southern regions of the Mediterranean area, improve people’s quality of life and promote understanding between the inhabitants of the various regions. But if free trade becomes the guiding principle, these goals will become nothing more than window dressing, and a handful of wealthy people will once again be the ones to benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I also protest against the fact that the EU-Mediterranean partnership is being misused as an instrument in order to prevent people from migrating from this region to the EU. For a while now, the European Union has had the ‘fight against illegal immigration’ and the ‘repatriation of ‘illegal’ refugees written as objectives into treaties with the Mediterranean States, as well as into every agreement with one or more third countries. In this way, each individual agreement adds one more brick to fortress Europe. This report is another example of the EU policy of pulling up the drawbridge where immigrants and refugees are concerned. The countries of the southern Mediterranean region have been declared as the forecourts to fortress Europe. It is their duty to ensure that ‘undesirable persons’ do not get into the EU. I ask myself how the EU can insist on the partner states in the Mediterranean showing respect for human rights and the freedom of the individual, when it does not respect the rights of immigrants itself, gives these people illegal status and wants to keep them away from Europe at any price, even if it leads to their being killed. This report safeguards, once again, the free movement of goods, services and capital. Once again, freedom and human rights are trampled underfoot. I will therefore vote against it, despite the fact that it contains a number of positive elements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Member for a town that looks on to the Mediterranean, I hope that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is given comparable resources for the period 2000-2006 to those given to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In implementing the MEDA programme, the simplification proposed by the European Commission and intensified by this report are beneficial. If we consider the appropriation of funds in the first MEDA programme, how can we justify the fact that only a quarter of the appropriations have actually been paid and that it takes an average of four years for payments to be made? This kind of problem harms our credibility on the international scene and gives European taxpayers a terrible impression of the way in which Community institutions use public funds. We cannot be satisfied with such a record.</p>
<p class="contents">The best we can do now is to back the amendments proposed by the European Commission. Aid to Mediterranean countries must be provided quickly and efficiently, in line with the European Union’s political priorities. Mr Valdivielso de Cué’s report, which proposes that the administration and management of projects should be decentralised, that the MED committee should be given new guidelines, and which insists on improving cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, makes a significant contribution to improving MEDA.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing the European Parliament’s participation in MEDA’s decision-making process is another point that I believe to be crucial. I also deplore the fact that, on an issue as important as changing the MEDA regulation, Parliament only has the right to state its opinion by means of the consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">With the amendments that we are proposing in this report, the MEDA programme will have simplified, decentralised and transparent implementation procedures. I now hope that the Community budget will provide this programme with financial resources that match up to the political ambitions that we are publicly stating for the Mediterranean area. The European Commission has committed itself to increasing MEDA’s staffing levels, with a view to reaching similar levels of human resources enjoyed by other major programmes such as PHARE and TACIS. When it comes to looking at the budget for 2001, the European Parliament must ensure that this commitment is translated into action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the appropriations allocated to the MEDA programme, I hope that the financial package reflects the political will – which the Council and Parliament have both been trumpeting – to make the Euro-Mediterranean partnership one of our priorities for external action.</p>

I gave Mr Fernández Martín my opinion when we were talking about the Canary Islands, and he quite rightly said: “Yes, but prawns do not vote, besides which I am a fisherman.”</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this report has shortcomings, in that it gives money to the Republic of Guinea, on the one hand, to help replenish fish stocks and reduce the number of fish caught, and, on the other, to send European Union fishing boats to those seas to catch prawns and tuna. Well, I think that this is a form of colonialism which must be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Varela’s second report, on the Mauritius fisheries agreement, I did indeed vote in favour, Madam President, but I must emphasise that it was not an easy decision. Why? Because the Committee on Development and Cooperation tabled an amendment asking for fishermen’s wages and, I would add, their pensions to be monitored. Unfortunately, this amendment was not adopted. Now, with this document, we are about to conclude a trade agreement, and we are giving away Union funds but are not requesting to be able to monitor the fishermen’s contracts. In my view, that is not a good move. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our overriding objective was to get this very important report through as the first report communitarising European Community immigration laws and as a matter of justice to third-country nationals. We have therefore shown solidarity with other like-minded groups and Members. We supported the Socialist Group amendments to remove beneficiaries of subsidiary protection in the light of the Commissioner's pledge to bring forward a proposal covering them as well as beneficiaries of temporary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have preferred beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to stay in as a matter of principle, because they are long-term legal residents, but we decided to assist the passage of the report. Similarly, we abstained on matters concerning ascending relatives, because, wherever possible, we wish to remove objections so as to secure a clear majority for the report and recognise that the inclusion of such relatives raises particular problems for some Members. Some of us in my group, however, would have liked us to express a more generous stance. Mrs Malmström and Mrs van der Laan have asked me specifically to mention them in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has deliberately voted to include unmarried partners if the Member State concerned legally recognises such partnerships, as I think three currently do.

This vote shows just how European MEPs and the Commission, which drafted the original proposal, are both failing in their main duty, which is not to satisfy the whole world, but to protect Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This vote also confirms what we have always said about communitising immigration policy by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is being applied here to the particular case of family reunification by means of Article 63(3) of the Treaty on European Union: the transfer of decision-making powers from national level to European level is being used not to strengthen nations, as some have claimed in order to deceive voters, but instead to demolish their defences more completely.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive on family reunification, as approved by the Watson report, proclaims a Community-level law on family reunification which, in legal terms, does not yet exist at this level and which, in our opinion, should not be made law. The truth is that the host State does not force the immigrants to move there. This is a decision taken by the immigrant himself, and if he is received into that State, it is not his place to claim the right to bring in other people.</p>
<p class="contents">One notes, moreover, that the preamble to the proposal for a directive refers virtuously to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the international covenant of 1966, which recognise that “the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State”. At the same time, the so-called Convention which is drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union is stubbornly refusing to take this principle into consideration. It appears then that recognition of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society is useful when it serves to justify family reunification, but is no longer useful when it could serve to support European families.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive approved by the Watson report is not content to proclaim this non-existent law. It gives the title ‘applicant’ not only to legal immigrants but also to people who have refugee status. Moreover, the beneficiaries of family reunification are not just the applicant's spouse and children under 18, but also the unmarried partner who is in a stable relationship with the applicant, which will include homosexual couples when the Member State’s legislation treats them in the same way as married couples for legal purposes. The directive also includes children of full age who cannot reasonably look after themselves, as well as the relatives in the ascending line of the applicant, their spouse, or even of their unmarried partner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the floodgates are open wide and that the aim is to encourage immigration on a massive scale that will change the very nature of European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The political classes in each country could probably not have voted for such a text, because they are too closely watched by the public. They have therefore shifted the responsibility over to Brussels, which is now forced to do their dirty work behind closed doors That is the real job of Europe today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns the issue of family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">This right is currently only recognised by international legal instruments, specifically the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950. At national level, situations are extremely disparate. Family reunification enables the family unit to be protected and makes the integration of third-country nationals into Member States easier. It was therefore crucial to incorporate the law on family reunification into Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal therefore sets out to establish a law on family reunification for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in a Member State, as long as they fulfil a certain number of financial and procedural conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the work of my fellow Members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, who have made a considerable effort to combat the extremely limiting and conservative vision of the first rapporteur. They have produced a text that is close to the European Commission’s basic proposal which, in my opinion, is on the whole quite satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, those belonging to one of the following categories will benefit from the law on family reunification:</p>
<p class="contents">- third-country nationals who are legally resident in the territory of a Member State and who have a residence permit, which is valid for at least one year.</p>
<p class="contents">- refugees, regardless of how long their residence permit is valid, or European Union citizens not exercising their right to free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Those entitled to claim family reunification are:</p>
<p class="contents">- the spouse or non-married partner of the applicant (including same-sex partners); although it should be noted that the provision covering non-married partners only applies in Member States where the position of non-married couples is comparable to that of married couples;</p>
<p class="contents">- the children of the couple, whether they are married or not, and whether they are born within marriage, out of wedlock or are from a previous marriage;</p>
<p class="contents">- the children of one of the spouses or partners are covered, on condition that the latter have actual custody and responsibility;</p>
<p class="contents">- relatives in the ascending line, when these people are in the applicant’s care as well as children of full age who are also dependants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority of these foreign nationals, i.e. 87%, are from EU countries. However, for some time now, the proportion of immigrants from third countries has been increasing more rapidly than that of EU citizens from the 14 other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our labour market depends on the presence of immigrants, although the most severe bottlenecks in our labour market are offset by cross-border commuters from France, Belgium and Germany. Almost a third of the work force, 80 000 people that is, are cross-border commuters. Over half of the working population does not have Luxembourg citizenship. These figures illustrate the interest my country has in a sound immigration policy, and, needless to say, in the important aspect of family reconciliation. It is, of course, one of the Commission‘s tasks, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to propose measures on the entry into, and residence, in the European Union, of third-country nationals, primarily with the undeniably admirable aim of bringing about an approximation of the legal provisions of individual Member States on the conditions governing the admission and residence of third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is right to comment, in its proposal for a directive on the right to reunification, that the presence of family members facilitates normal family life, thereby creating greater stability and enabling the individuals concerned to put roots down in the host country more successfully. We are aware, and regard highly the fact, that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions recognise the nuclear family as the basic social unit, which deserves protection and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, and notwithstanding the fact that some international agreements <span class="italic">do not </span>make provision for the right to family reunification, in principle, I still welcome the Commission proposal for a Community legal instrument in respect of family reunification. However, we do not want absolute chaos, and neither do we want to create new opportunities for gangs of human traffickers. Above all, we must ensure that these provisions take the absorption capacity of each Member State into account. This would certainly not be the case if we were to endorse the report of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in its present form. The rapporteur was entirely justified in withdrawing her name from the report, which was adopted in committee by 25 votes to 13. A directive of the kind proposed by the majority of the committee responsible is simply unworkable, dangerous and counterproductive. Only the amendments put forward by my group and the original rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, could have persuaded me to vote in favour of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am wholeheartedly in favour of family reunification. But how is the family to be defined? How many spouses, in the case of multiple marriages, how many children, partners, dependants in the widest sense of the word, or bogus spouses, should a single, legally resident third country national, be entitled to bring into the European Union? Ten, twenty, a hundred, depending on their own traditions and religion?</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian considerations should undoubtedly play a part, but the whole thing must still be manageable and controllable. Above all, we must ensure that this European directive does not land the individual Member States in a situation which they are no longer able to control.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, where Member States already have more generous provisions, they should be able to retain them.</p>
<p class="contents">My main objective in drafting this statement was to warn against carrying matters to excess, and the unforeseeable consequences thereof, but without wishing to compromise the principle of family unity. Nothing could be further from the truth! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, children’s right to be reunited with their parents must be protected, but the right to family reunification ought in certain cases (for example, when there are serious health reasons) to apply also to relatives in the ascending line, as well as to children who have come of age. It is also only right that, following death or divorce for example, relatives should have an automatic right of residence in the host country, just as they should be given the right to work and receive an education in that country.</p>

This would send out a powerful political message, demonstrating the will to react to these changes, which are caused by various upheavals, resulting particularly from economic and financial changes, the development of new technologies, international competition and the globalisation of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">It was at the Luxembourg Summit in November 1997 that we realised the importance of looking more closely into these phenomena so as to avoid suffering them again and to counter their negative consequences. This idea led to a meeting of a group of experts, better known as the Gyllenhammar group, which was given the task of studying the economic and social implications of industrial change.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions reached by this group persuaded the Cardiff European Council in December 1998 to accept the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change. We are finally debating this proposal today, and I hope it will be put into practice in the very near future!</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years we have seen a huge increase in the number of relocations, restructurings and mergers, which has greatly changed the face of European industry and which has had serious repercussions for employment and for economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States that are ill-prepared for these changes have experienced them too many times and have tried to pick up the pieces, as best they can, under the sometimes disapproving eye of the European Commission, which has not hesitated to condemn more than one Member State for some misdemeanour involving state aid!</p>
<p class="contents">The first victims of these unforeseen changes are, of course, the employees, who, in spite of increased growth and an improvement in the overall economic situation, still live in a climate of insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed we have recently seen companies making redundancies even when they are making profit, because they have to restructure and merge, with no thought, of course, of fulfilling their obligations to inform their employees and to communicate with them! I take this opportunity to appeal to the Council, which is blocking the proposal for a directive on informing and consulting workers!</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for anticipating industrial change. We will then be able to adopt the measures necessary to prepare employees better, particularly by offering them training with the aim of adapting them to the business sectors of the future! I support the proposal contained in the resolution which seeks to include the right to lifelong training in the Charter of Fundamental Rights! The centre’s studies will, of course, be widely distributed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this, by means of a European Parliament resolution! The common foreign and security policy has already left its mark in the shape of political and military interference in the domestic affairs of third countries in order to further the imperialist interests of the European Union, contrary to every interpretation of international law and to the interests of the citizens of the European Union and other countries. This happened just recently, in the case of Kosovo, and Yugoslavia more generally.</p>
<p class="contents">The militarisation of the European Union, the arms race, the harmonisation of military weapons and the war industry, the imposition of the will of the mighty in the jungle of ‘globalisation’ and the free market, are diametrically opposed to the visions and struggles of the people for peace, a political and peaceful solution to conflicts and the rule of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this policy goes hand in hand with the recent decisions taken by the Council to prohibit all access to documents concerning defence and security policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The general orientation of these decisions is to keep citizens of the Member States of the European Union from the centres of decision-making and to prevent them from interfering with developments. Barriers and hurdles are being placed in the way of the popular movement, national parliaments and the European Parliament alike, so as to prevent them from exercising any form of democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">What particularly worries me is the fact that, through fundamentally violating its own treaties, the European Union is attempting to by-pass its own internal rivalries by indirect means. It is seeking to support the interests of European big business, to conquer new markets, and to support the euro, even by taking military action. The New Order is placing new demands on people and on the less developed countries in order consolidate its supremacy.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, a policy is being promoted which faithfully serves big business, sides with the USA, submitting to its orders, and promotes the New Order against the interests of the people. This makes it easier to understand why the European Union is not troubled by the barbaric invasion and continued occupation of 38% of Cyprus and by Turkey’s bombing raids in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue for me is not only whether and how the joint actions will be funded by the community budget, but to stop this policy, which is disastrous for people and peace alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is not whether Mr Solana or other representatives of the CFSP will make annual announcements to the European Parliament, but for the people of Europe to take their fate into their own hands and to intervene effectively to impose peace, brotherhood and international cooperation based on the common good.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution restricts itself to the two issues I have mentioned, which are of secondary importance, and comes to the arbitrary, and especially dangerous, conclusion that the ‘intergovernmental system’ which is at the root of the EU’s foreign policy, is the reason for the failure of the common foreign and security policy and that its success depends on its communitisation. This disorients people and makes them prey to the unaccountable dictates of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">For all the above reasons, we believe that the ‘joint’ resolution in question demonstrates most dramatically how urgent it is for people to organise joint resistance and their opposition to this criminal policy, and to take the initiative and act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens of Europe have the right to see that Europe exists, and we have the means to show them – easily – through European television programmes. Moreover, it would be appropriate to regulate the television companies of the States of the European Union in order to allow all the political bodies in the different States freedom of expression, for this is not always the case at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The important aspects of the intervention of the European Union are:</p>
<p class="contents">1) The global competitiveness of European industry, especially in relation to the USA, must be combined with a guarantee of pluralism and cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">2) The increased effectiveness of the measures contained in Directive 89/552/ΕEC on ‘Television without Frontiers’, concerning the promotion of European works.</p>
<p class="contents">3) The promotion of linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">4) The protection of minors using new programme control methods.</p>
<p class="contents">5) The creation of a European forum on cooperation in matters of transparency and the development of strategies to address market concentrations.</p>
<p class="contents">6) The support of the public audiovisual sector with the option of broadcasting on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">7) The promotion of an internal market for the cinema with the issue of a new directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be voting for the Veltroni report, as it is a considerable improvement on the Communication from the Commission. But I do have two reservations. The first has to do with the notion of rivalry, which may justify major concentrations and groupings of audiovisual media in the name of becoming stronger than the Americans, and may extend the Berlusconi phenomenon. The second concerns the lack of compliance and control mechanisms to ensure that the political aims of the European Parliament do not once again remain mere wishes, which is often the case with the successive amendments to the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such adaptation is actually crucial, given recent developments in digital technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only achieve this if we respect the principles governing this field, which are:</p>
<p class="contents">- the protection of pluralism:</p>
<p class="contents">to achieve this task, I once again stress the fact that, as provided for in the protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, public service broadcasting plays a central part in safeguarding pluralism as well as cultural and linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">-</span> the possibility of targeting intervention to provide strategic support for services of general interest:</p>
<p class="contents">the public must be guaranteed access to audiovisual services on the basis of criteria such as universality, affordable costs and non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">- the maximum protection for those producing audiovisual works, and hence the possibility of providing better protection for intellectual ownership rights, copyright and related ownership rights:</p>
<p class="contents">the effectiveness of copyright protection is jeopardised in the digital age. Respect for intellectual property is nevertheless a source of vitality in the audiovisual and cinematographic sector and the proposal for a directive on copyright and associated rights in the information society must therefore be speedily adopted, both to protect created works and to ensure that they are accessible and can circulate freely.</p>
<p class="contents">- the increased protection for users, who will be covered by various safeguards depending on the different services that they use:</p>
<p class="contents">I approve of the idea of stepping up experiments with programme filtering systems and other methods of parental control for the protection of minors.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to stress that a revision of Directive (89/552/EEC) on ‘Television without Frontier’ is crucial. We must strengthen the provisions on the circulation of European works and on independent production in order to make them more effective. The obligation of public and private television broadcasters to allocate a proportion of their annual net income to investment in production and to the acquisition of European audiovisual programmes, including films, works aimed at minorities and ones made by independent producers, must be included in this piece of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This socio-economic investigation, which was carried out during the latter part of 1998, is based on the answers sent in by around 10 000 students who participated in “mobility actions” during 1997-98.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erasmus programme was set up in 1987 as part of the Socrates programme, and absorbs 40% of the total Socrates budget. Erasmus seeks to encourage the mobility of students by developing the European dimension of education and by enabling young people to carry out part of their studies in another Member State. The Socrates programme entered its second phase with the decision of 24 January 2000. It is, moreover, a pity that this report took so long after the Socrates II programme was formally adopted to publish its conclusions, which, as a result, could not be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is agreed on welcoming this initiative, thanks to which 90 000 students every year take up the opportunity to study abroad. More than nine out of ten of those students claimed to be very satisfied with their stay abroad, both from the educational and the socio-cultural points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be admitted, however, that the participation rate is still low, given that this programme involves 18 Member States. This is what the Commission inquiry has shown: only 1% of students took part in Erasmus mobility programmes in 1998. We therefore still have a great deal to do if we are to achieve the target of 10%, which the programme is aiming for.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore try to discover the reasons for such a low participation rate. The survey does provide us with some answers.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that more than 57% of Erasmus students encounter financial difficulties. It is nevertheless young people from privileged backgrounds who go abroad, which is an unacceptable form of discrimination, which we must combat by allocating special aid to the less well-off socio-economic categories. Many problems remain in the field of the recognition of qualifications. As Member for a border area, I regularly meet graduates who are distraught because the courses they have studied in another Member State are not recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by appealing to the French Presidency to include all of these factors in the study paper that it has asked the Vision group to undertake on transnational mobility in education. This study paper should lead to the presentation, at the Nice Summit, of an action plan which seeks to overcome the obstacles to this mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now hope that the Commission and the Member States will take the necessary steps to make the Erasmus programme more accessible to students from economically less well-off groups, particularly by optimising coordination between national financial support for higher education and Erasmus grants, with a view to promoting social equality in access to the programme and the widest possible take-up.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue to accept that the overall participation rate in the programme is barely above 50%, and that even so, some 57% of Erasmus students have been affected by worrying financial problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report points out, it is regrettable that the Erasmus programme has essentially benefited students from social groups whose parents have a high level of qualifications, are relatively well-off, and/or come from countries with higher levels of government support for students. Hence the need for measures to help achieve its initial objective of enabling 10% of all Community students to spend part of their degree course in another Member State, and not just 1% as happened in 1997/1998, making it accessible to students from economically less well-off groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various Community instruments have enabled this right to become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990, two directives (90/364/EEC and 90/365/EEC) have extended the right of residence by defining general principles and rules for workers who have stopped work. A third directive (93/96/EC), adopted in 1993, contains specific provisions for students. Since 1993 and the Treaty of Maastricht, any Member State national has the right to move and reside freely in the European Union (Article 14 of the EC Treaty), and this right forms part of European citizenship (Article 18).</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are discussing today seeks to provide an overview of the implementation of the directives on the right of residence of students, pensioners and other non-economically-active members of society as well as to study the special measures concerning European Union citizens’ moving and settling for reasons of public order, security and health (Directive 64/221/EEC).</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first section, we must admit that although the directives in question have been transposed, in some cases painstakingly, into national legislation, many obstacles remain, which must be overcome by adopting a raft of specifically-targeted measures. To mention one problem with which I am very familiar, that of students, I think it is crucial that we provide them with better information on their rights if they wish to study in another Member State. We also need to solve the problem of the recognition of diplomas, which is proving to be a significant issue in certain professions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second section, there are many problems in the way Directive 64/221/EEC has been implemented. The Treaty allows Member States to impose limits on the free movement of persons for reasons of public order, public security or public health. The Commission is aware, however, that Member States are interpreting these concepts in a totally different way, often too broadly, and it stresses that they must be applied in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The Commission also stresses that these concepts must only be applied in the face of a genuine and sufficiently serious threat, which would affect a society’s fundamental wellbeing. In any event, these concepts must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that, in order to resolve these difficulties, we will need to adopt a framework directive to organise and guarantee the unimpeded exercise of freedom of movement and residence. An overall redrafting of the existing texts will make this possible and will have the advantage of putting an end to the current inequalities of treatment in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when these conditions are met will we enable nationals of Member States to gain awareness and to give substance to this concept of European citizenship, which for many is still nothing but a hollow shell. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of the free movement of persons, included in the Treaty of Rome fifty years ago, still encounters many difficulties in its practical implementation. As mentioned in the report, the implementation of the directives on the right of residence of students and retired people (90/364, 90/365 and 93/96) is clearly unsatisfactory, and the same is true for the directive on migrant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Workers in ‘atypical’ employment – part-time, short-term, etc. – face residence problems in the host country. In addition, as the rapporteur points out, there are at present millions of third-country nationals residing lawfully in the European Union who often find themselves deprived of the right to free movement and residence. Hence it is essential that the Member States and the Commission take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of migrant workers are upheld and to improve their situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to students and retired people too, it is essential to speed up the bureaucratic process and to facilitate the free movement and residence of these citizens of the European Union in any Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I am unable to support this report in principle, because it takes advantage of the situation, with a view to demanding freedom of movement and establishment for all third-country nationals who have the right of residence in a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">There are millions of third-country nationals who fit this description, and it is completely unacceptable to saddle other Member States with the consequences of giving freedom of movement to millions of people, without taking the individual Member States’ absorption capacity into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have doubts about admitting Malta to the European Union. If the demands made in the Boumediene-Thiery report in respect of freedom of movement for third-country nationals were to be met, this would have a far more serious impact than if we were to grant the citizens of the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe freedom of movement and establishment, without a transitional period, which is something no one in their right mind would consider.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to fan the flames of xenophobia within the Community, then I can think of no better way than to support the excessive and unreasonable proposals contained in the Boumediene-Thiery report, which thank God, was adopted in committee by only 23 votes in favour to 15 votes against.</p>
<p class="contents">It is asking too much of the other Member States as it is, for the German Government to allow several million third-country nationals resident on its territory to hold German citizenship in addition to their own. In so doing, with a single stroke of the pen, it creates several million new EU citizens entitled to freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, and in fact they even have the right to vote at local and European elections. Yet at the same time, your colleague Mr Verheugen, is calling for a referendum on eastwards enlargement. What about our right to a referendum against Germany’s being able to decide completely independently, and without reference to the other Member States, to present us with several million more EU citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot cope with the consequences of such generosity, as well intentioned as it may be, because it will be open to exploitation, particularly by gangs of human traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">I say ‘yes’ to a rational immigration policy that we can sustain, but ‘no’ to the chaos that the Boumediene-Thiery report would inevitably cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Students, retired people, certain categories of workers, especially those in ‘atypical’ forms of employment, and in part-time employment, are called upon to confront a whole host of difficulties and problems concerning residence in the host country. This is due to the sheer volume of formalities for the issue and renewal of residence permits and other difficulties associated with providing evidence of sufficient means.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, not only does the notorious ‘European area of freedom’ not exist; it is so inextricably bound up with financial criteria that the right of residence, while recognised as an ‘inalienable’ right, is only granted to those who are financially independent. In other words, we are dealing not only with the complete distortion of concepts but also with the utter derision of hundreds of thousands of European citizens and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, if we add to this the unacceptable phenomenon of the abusive interpretation of the concepts of public order and security, not only is the free movement and residence of people simply undermined and contravened in many cases, but it also becomes the springboard for the violation of fundamental and individual rights such as the right to the protection of personal information. On the pretext of public order, the Schengen Information System stores, transmits and processes personal details in violation of the Treaties, Community law and international law. We would also like to highlight the numerous cases of expulsion for economic reasons or for reasons of general prevention. In none of these cases is there anything to warrant regarding these people as belonging to sufficiently serious categories to justify their violent deportation.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of the fundamental protection of human rights and of the dignity of European citizens and third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union, it is essential that residence procedures are simplified in such a way that the unimpeded exercising of this right can be organised and secured and that inequalities and violations of basic democratic principles can be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must simplify and relax as far as possible the necessary procedures and formalities for students and retired people regarding the issues of adequate means and the granting and renewal of residence permits. The granting and renewal of residence permits must be simplified for migrant workers, and social security and medical care systems must be simplified so as to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these workers. Family reunification must also be made easier by simplifying the residence conditions for family members, and by simplifying the system for granting and issuing residence permits, if the applicant meets the necessary conditions, for at least 5 years. Finally, an end must be put to the abusive appeal to public order, which turns European citizens into ‘usual suspects’ for reasons other than public security, in blatant violation of the rule of law, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
