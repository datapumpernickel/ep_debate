The decisions taken last year by the previous Commission on the financing of this programme were extremely vague, meaning that it is already a foregone conclusion that there will be a major dispute between farmers and those in favour of Natura 2000 within the Committee on Agriculture and among those in charge of the Regional Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that Mr Dimas must devote a great deal of energy to finding a simple solution to the problem of how Natura 2000 is to be reinforced in future. What matters is not the level of funding, or even the individual programmes; what matters is that the ideas associated with the Natura 2000 programme are translated into real-life policies. It is for this reason that funding must not be tied up in negotiating structures to such an extent that it disappears when the crucial debates are finally held.</p>
<p class="contents">We have used the Habitat Directive for many years to encourage the Member States to designate appropriate sites in their territory, whilst assuring them that funding would be guaranteed. If we were to stop this funding now, or even to take it out of the budgets for agriculture or regional development, it would be a pretty poor show on our part. It would inevitably lead to arguments, and this is why we are asking you today to take proactive measures to prevent this problem. If it turned out at some point in the future that funding were to be taken out of the agriculture or regional development pillars, we would have hundreds of thousands of mayors lined up here to complain, and there would be little hope for the NGOs or for you as Environment Commissioner. There is no need for me to remind you that a strong agricultural lobby exists, to which I, as a farmer, also belong. It is therefore inevitable that disputes will arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to encourage you to ensure that your Commission lays down clear rules, and I would be very grateful to you for doing so. I hope that we will be able to adopt this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Μember of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the protection of biodiversity is a priority policy for the Commission and that the successful application of the Natura 2000 framework is the cornerstone of the European Union's efforts to achieve this objective. Securing adequate financing for Natura 2000, as Mr Florenz stressed, is therefore one of our top priorities, and I fully endorse the objectives and priorities of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that this priority is shared by many of my colleagues in the Commission, who have agreed to adjust the Regional, Agricultural and other Funds in order to include Natura 2000 in financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have a legal obligation and are committed to effective management of Natura 2000 areas. Safeguarding the financial resources for such management comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States but, precisely because of the specialised character of Natura 2000, the Commission helps by providing Community cofinancing. Use of these Community resources is the responsibility of the Member States but, for our part, we are prepared to offer all possible help in order to facilitate access to them. If, therefore, it is found that management of these areas is not being adequately supported, the Commission is prepared to refer the Member State in question to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this in mind, the Commission, as Mr Florenz said, adopted a communication on financing for Natura 2000 on 15 July 2004. It examined all the possible permutations, including the creation of a separate fund, and concluded that the most efficient approach is to incorporate financing for Natura 2000 in existing Community funds. The new Structural Fund regulations, which are currently being discussed in the Council, will be applied by the Member States and the regions on a decentralised basis. Consequently, there is no facility to determine a specific sum within any one fund.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being also, we cannot know what sums it will be possible to make available each year for cofinancing of Natura 2000 areas during the period from 2007 to 2013. This is because, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is incumbent upon each Member State to decide on the requirements of these areas when preparing their national programmes. In all events, the Commission has the means to safeguard priority for Natura 2000 within these national programmes. I shall come back to this point at the end of my intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, a few comments on the new regulations being debated. As regards the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, I must say that it contains a reference to cofinancing for Natura 2000 and for biodiversity, which are included in the objectives of convergence and competitiveness. There are also cofinancing facilities under the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund regulations, especially in order to strengthen management capacities in relation to Natura 2000. Natura 2000 is also included – and this is important – in the second land management axis in the new rural development regulation, which will account for 25% of its total. The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 22 billion for land management during the period from 2007 to 2013. It is necessary – and here, Mr Florenz, I need the support of the European Parliament – for this sum to be secured and, if possible, increased. The support of the European Parliament on this issue is therefore of prime importance. The new regulations contain mechanisms which allow the Commission, as I said earlier, to provide guidance and to control to some degree the content of the programmes submitted by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after the adoption of the proposed regulations for the Structural Funds, which will possibly happen towards the end of spring, the Commission will define its specific priorities for financing all the funds in detail in one set of strategic guidelines. As is standard practice, consultations will be held on the content of the guidelines with the participation of all the interested services, including the Environment DG. Care will be taken during these consultations to ensure that cofinancing for Natura 2000 is included as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the strategic guidelines have been issued, the Member States will need to prepare national strategic frameworks during the second half of 2005 or in early 2006, together with operational programmes, which they will submit to the Commission. All the interested Commission services will be included in the consultations held on the content of these programmes. Of course, suitable action will be taken on the part of the Environment DG to safeguard the priority of Natura 2000 actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as far as national rural development programmes are concerned, which Mr Florenz said earlier would be in a competitive relationship, every programme submitted will be examined in detail in order to ensure that account is taken both of the Community legislative framework and the priorities of policy on issues such as biodiversity, Natura 2000 area management, climate change, the application of ideas on water resources and other issues. If, of course, it is found that a national programme does not include adequate financial coverage for all this, the Commission services always have the right to reject it. This is another safeguard to ensure that Natura 2000 maintains its priority in the Member States' programmes, although it is not an absolute guarantee. It is therefore the main obligation of everyone interested in financing Natura 2000 to exert pressure so that the Member States not only propose ambitious objectives in their national and operational programmes, but also safeguard permanent and continuing action to prepare valid Natura 2000 programmes. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe we are finding the situation very frustrating because the issue has been dealt with without taking account of the concepts which are essential to sustainability and, furthermore, we have made the old mistake of seeing Natura 2000 as a crystallised territory, with no life or activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the first declaration of protected areas, Natura 2000, rather than bringing society pleasure, has become a problem. Nowhere wants to be declared a protected area, because there is no parallel support policy. It has become a constant battle. There has been no education about the exploitation of natural resources, nor of the true added value of the Natura Network, which generates and awakens enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there has been hidden expropriation, since the use of land is much more restricted than before and, in many cases, the value of the land is reduced. It has therefore become a burden. So what is the problem with the document we are dealing with? Firstly, it does not recognise typologies. We cannot introduce the concept of Natura 2000 without looking at the great families of biodiversity, because each of them requires a different financial instrument. For example, how are the marine funds, which do not appear, to be managed by means of rural development? A separate Natura will have to be created. Neither are rivers treated as significant, while I believe they should be treated as an essential project. Neither is there any proper distinction between the different forest areas. There should at least have been an indication of an intention to produce a diversified policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that, if we did not introduce Natura into the market economy, we will not have achieved anything, because nature means life, economy and sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The village was close to a wetland – a real bird paradise. As we got out of the car he asked me to stay silent for a while. He wanted just to listen to the concerto of the birds and the cicadas. In our region in the west, he told me sadly, we have lost these untouched nature sites forever; you should preserve yours at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the Natura 2000 initiative can be defined by scientific criteria, but the basic motivation is simple: to save at least some parts of European natural sites for ourselves and for future generations. The biggest challenge for our future is the decrease in natural resources such as clean air, pure water and a healthy environment. A high grade of biodiversity is crucial for a healthy living environment, for food security and for quality of life in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these goals, Natura 2000 is also an effective tool to support European villages and the people living there. It is an important way of promoting organic farming and ecotourism. It provides jobs and revitalises rural areas. Natura 2000 can help redefine the role of rural areas in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we came here to praise Natura 2000, not to bury it, as Shakespeare might have said. The future of our natural heritage needs and deserves at least the EUR 6.1 billion per year set aside for these brief projects. Natura 2000 can be funded in different ways, either by what is known as 'earmarking' a share of existing funds, or through an independent Natura 2000 fund. There are many technical details we have to resolve, but we should be united on one thing: the level of funding for Natura 2000 cannot be even one cent lower than was proposed earlier by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask every political group and everybody in leading positions to rescue the original proposal and to improve it in order to ensure that, one way or another, the given amount will be spent entirely on Natura 2000 purposes.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, agriculture is a specific component of rural development, and as far as I am concerned, so is the Natura 2000 programme. Nature plays an essential role in the development of the countryside and cannot be see in isolation from other aspects of agriculture and of other employment initiatives in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, Europe has promoted this by means of legislation. We are familiar with the Bird and Habitat Directive, which has been transposed into the Flora and Fauna Act in the Netherlands, and we have created special payments systems for all those regulations. We are also familiar with the mountain farmers’ regulation, the Natura 2000 additional payments, and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future, I have already said that I see all those programmes as forming part of rural development, and I think that we should therefore ensure that a special fund for Natura 2000 is set up within the framework of the rural development fund. The big question then is: how should the money be spent? As the Commissioner already indicated, we are familiar with the system of cofinancing, which, in my view, can take on special forms. In some countries, this cofinancing is clearly a problem – probably a bigger problem for poorer countries than for the richer ones. Perhaps the Commission could look into the possibility of having different cofinancing systems running parallel in the framework of this programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from what I said about agriculture being, by nature, a form of rural development, another question which the Commission might be able to look into is whether subsidies to agriculture are generally more expensive than subsidies to nature development in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not satisfied with it, because, if you will allow me to be particularly direct and straightforward, at the end of the day the question we might ask ourselves today, following your proposals, is whether the European Union really wants to preserve its biodiversity. If so, it is like a cathedral, we need to provide the resources to manage the Natura 2000 network. Without money, without a budget that is actually set aside for this expenditure, I do not think it is worth us deluding ourselves.</p>

<p class="contents">Natura 2000 will be in direct competition with all the other projects. Of course, agriculturally there will be possibilities for integration, which will be the proof that Natura 2000 has been integrated. But we are not deluding ourselves, Commissioner. We really need to go further. And because we have absolutely no confidence in this proposal, as rapporteur for Life+, I am proposing, as the Council and the Commission have not decided on the 3 billion euros per year needed for management, that in Life+ we should include a Life section, which was formerly ‘Nature’: Life management Natura 2000.</p>

Are there any issues at which most Members of the European Parliament will not try to throw taxpayers' money? Sadly, it seems not. Not content with single legal frameworks, tax harmonisation and the rest, the EU apparently wants to control nature. That is patently stupid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Habitats Directive of 1992, which established Natura 2000, states the EU's intention to define a common framework for the conservation of wild plants and animals. In the bold new Europe, even nature has to be standardised. Wiser counsels know this is impossible. When man seeks to play God, nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasserting itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the IND/DEM Group, which has Danish and English co-chairmen, I am reminded of the story of King Canute: tired of the flattery of his courtiers who told him he could control anything and everything, he took them to the beach and commanded the sea to turn back. The waves, of course, continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point. It strikes me that Canute had more sense than Europe's rulers have today.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU is not power crazy and really is just an economic bloc, perhaps someone could tell me why it is necessary, for example, to list and protect all species of bat? Has anybody asked the bats? No, of course not. Once again, I can only conclude that if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question.

The Natura 2000 project is exceptional simply because it incorporates ideals and also people’s aspirations. It is based on the protection of Europe’s cultural and natural heritage, on the preservation and protection of biodiversity. Apart from these rather grand ideas, the Natura 2000 project is also exceptional in that it could be a driving force in the development of rural areas. It is of great socio-economic significance with respect to employment and tourism and also to the protection of the population’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, just as the Constitutional Treaty is being adopted and ratified in the different states, it is very important that, on this matter too, we are able to say what is the position of Parliament in the development of such projects and what is the position of the Commission, which has to facilitate such projects and which has to provide the resources for the project to achieve its goals.</p>

<p class="contents">In comparison to other European countries, Poland can boast of significant achievements in the field of environmental protection. The designation of protected areas is a Polish tradition that goes back to the 19th century, with such areas now covering 32% of the country, up from 9% just 20 years ago. Yet Poland is concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the Natura 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network. The country has therefore put its name to the declaration submitted by a majority of EU Member States in October and December, in which they express their disappointment at the European Commission’s proposal concerning the cofinancing of the Natura 2000 network. No clear details are provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for Natura 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the Natura 2000 network. It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures. The majority of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites in Poland will not be covered by the funds indicated, for example, land that is part of national forests, or swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the European Commission’s letter of 6 January 2005 to Poland, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of Natura 2000 sites in the country, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries. Poland therefore expects that in the course of work on the new Financial Perspective, appropriate levels of funding will be safeguarded for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network. I would suggest that the LIFE+ Regulation also contains separate provisions for LIFE+ and for Natura 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The comments I am about to make will therefore relate to the Commission, and not to you personally.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is my opinion that the reason why this House is having to deal with the problem of Natura 2000 is that the Commission has not had the courage to propose a suitable financial instrument. This is the first point I should like to make; in the Habitat Directive we committed ourselves to cofinancing and to the provision of funding, yet no corresponding provisions have been made in our various funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither, secondly, has the Commission had the courage to ensure that the existing regulations – the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation – contain appropriate stipulations. They are full of ‘can’s’, ‘should’s’ and ‘could’s’, which is by no means adequate, or at least not in our opinion, and indeed we are all aware of where such language gets us. The intention is that regions in the Member States submit operational programmes, and the Commission then assesses and approves them. We are well aware of this, but there is no guarantee that what is written down will actually be read. In the current programming period, for example, the advancement of women’s concerns has been included as a goal in the Structural Funds Regulation, and indeed this was something for which Parliament fought strongly. The Member States, however, have reacted by doing next to nothing, and this is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we need a separate instrument to finance Natura 2000, and indeed this House has already agreed that a separate financial instrument is needed; one need only look at the individual committees’ opinions on the Financial Perspective. The Committee on Agriculture has already said that the protection of biodiversity is not a primary or genuine rural development policy. We all know what that means; our agriculture experts do not want to have to use money from rural development funds to pay for Natura 2000 either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With a single exception, we are all agreed that Natura 2000 is incredibly important, and we are also all agreed that the money must be obtained. I do not know if everyone is aware of how much money is involved – at least EUR 6 billion per year. This means that at least EUR 3 billion must be obtained from Natura 2000. This could not ever possibly be obtained using just one fund. Irrespective of ways and means, we must have this project integrated into the other funds, and that is something on which we agree. We shall support the Commission in this matter, and I must also say that the green movements, Bird Life etc are in favour of our having the funding of Natura 2000 integrated. The problem is that I could not glean from the Commissioner’s answer how he is to ensure that this will in actual fact happen. Mr Florenz provided an engaging description of the conflicts that will arise. If it has not been ensured that the money is earmarked and tied, nothing will come of matters. Purely for the sake of funding, we therefore need a clearer answer from the Commission than we have received so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say, however, that it is not only an issue of obtaining enough money. It is also an issue of getting the whole of our rural districts policy in tune with the natural environment, so that agriculture is carried on, and development pursued, in these areas in ways that respect the vulnerable natural environment instead of, as now, in ways that include driving large road systems through vulnerable areas. I have seen how, in Poland, exemptions are granted for brutal pannage in an extremely vulnerable and very rich, but therefore fragile, natural environment. We therefore need also to take account of the way in which we develop rural districts and to ensure that Natura 2000 is incorporated and that there is enough money. If the money cannot be found within the existing funds mentioned, allow me to point out that we have just obtained a majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in favour also of beginning to examine the first pillar, where almost all of the EU’s money is, of course, to be found. There are such large sums allocated to direct agricultural aid that it is time we began to look at this aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the problem is a great deal more serious; not only is there no guaranteed funding, there is also an increasing lack of knowledge and growing uncertainty on the ground over what it really means when a Natura 2000 site is designated.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I should like to raise a number of points. Firstly, Natura 2000 programmes must not be financed at the expense of farmers, and under no circumstances must farmers be the only ones to suffer; otherwise, as Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines clearly stated, property owners will be deprived almost entirely of what is due to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is intolerable that infrastructure and economic development in large parts of the EU should languish due to delays and a lack of clarity over the designation of sites. In many rural areas, investment programmes that would be useful and compatible with the nature of these areas cannot be carried out because questions remain unanswered. It is also intolerable that the Natura 2000 programme, the real aim of which is to improve the EU’s standing by sending out a clear signal that we wish to be an environmental union, and not just an economic union, should be perverted in such a way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is unacceptable that we are reaching a point where no one knows what they are doing any more, and that the reason for this is to be found, above all, in the bureaucratic procedures in Brussels and the Commission. Brussels bids us designate sites everywhere – no one is entirely sure where the money will come from, but that can be dealt with later. Countries have been told they will be brought before the Court of Justice if they do not designate any sites, something that the Commissioner has now, indeed, confirmed. This programme is not about the environment; it is designed to make a public nuisance of itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our fellow citizens share our ambition of protecting biodiversity and see that we are producing texts, but when it comes to obtaining funds, Europe does not deliver the goods. Our fellow citizens accept the idea of sustainable development, thinking that it is possible to reconcile protecting the earth with economic development and employment, but when they need the channels and resources to do this, Europe does not deliver the goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to find some new instruments for maintaining Natura 2000. I would like to make three demands: first of all, we need a specific fund, because objectively there is a contradiction between expectations for funds to promote economic development, rural development, and sustaining the land in accordance with Natura 2000. We therefore need a specific fund, which is the first demand.</p>
<p class="contents">My second demand: the implementation of Natura 2000 needs to be favoured in the criteria for all European funds. I will give you an example to illustrate the contradiction. In the current ERDF regulation that you are in the process of negotiating, the areas are limited to wooded or cultivated areas. Natura 2000 needs natural, untouched land that is not wooded or cultivated, in other words wetlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need an instrument for innovation, so that practices on the ground are more in line with what we could provide for in the future. Therefore in Life + we need a specific instrument and we need to maintain two pillars: a general environmental pillar and a pillar for Life Nature, as we had before.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have understood, Commissioner, as they stand, we do not think that the Commission’s proposals will convince our fellow citizens on the ground. We believe that protecting biodiversity is a step forward, which is compatible with the development of rural areas and the economic future of our country. We therefore now need proof of this conviction, in the form of three billion euros at least from the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in all our interests that Natura 2000 should become a workable system. This is why we questioned your colleagues during the sitting of the parliamentary committee and that is why we ask you too what assurances and what guarantees you can give us to ensure that the entire network will be financially viable. Unfortunately, we have learned that the answers received from the Commission have been meaningless and that they could not promise any kind of solid guarantees behind the attractive facade of an integrated approach. But there is a need for guarantees. I have come from Hungary, where the government has been able to contravene the earlier agreement made with the European Union, and redirect 8 billion Forints from agricultural-environment protection into direct subsidies for farming. Because of this and similar reasons, farmers are demonstrating with their tractors in the capital of my country even as we speak.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hungary there is a saying that if someone burns their mouth once with hot water, then later they will blow on cold water too. This is how we feel now <span class="bold">–</span> the empty responses of the Commission and the stance of some Member States have burned us and are forcing us to be more careful. Therefore, I, together with my fellow representatives, ask the Council and likewise the Commission to create a separate budget item serving the goals of Natura 2000, that is within the financial projections in preparation, in parallel with the significant upgrading of the LIFE+ programme and within the farm budget – to which I would immediately add that we can only imagine this together with real increases in the farm budget earmarked for this purpose – or on the other hand, with steps being taken to create a completely separate fund. I further ask the representatives of the Commission to take into account the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and also Croatia – which has not been considered in the draft in its current form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see this as a very important debate, and as one that shows that pressure must be brought to bear by this House to ensure that a separate instrument is created to finance Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the previous speakers said that Natura 2000 is seen in some quarters as a programme for annoying the public. In a great many other quarters, however, it is viewed as providing real assistance in the struggle to protect biodiversity. I believe that it is our task to support those who view it in this way, and, in common with many of my fellow Members, I am therefore in favour of there being a separate financial instrument in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it is not entirely accurate to say that it is not the amount of funding made available that matters. Many of the NGOs working in this field have told us that the Commission’s estimate of an annual cost of EUR 6.1 billion can only be considered an absolute minimum. We will therefore have the task of ensuring that not only a separate instrument, but also sufficient funding, is made available.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see the attraction in an integrated approach, but I share Mrs Haug’s views, who said that the situation is similar to what we have seen in the case of policies on women’s issues; for years anyone who did not wish to give any consideration to women’s issues said that there was no need to do so because of gender mainstreaming. Everybody then waited for progressive policies on women’s issues and equal opportunities to miraculously appear. If an integrated approach is to be adopted, then what is needed is a dual strategy; integration into existing funds, but a separate financial instrument in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union ordered, or rather instigated, the establishment of the Natura 2000 network throughout Europe. Yet the EU has still not provided a precise definition of what kind of measures must be taken, what kind of regulations must be adopted or what kind of arrangements must be made with regard to the sites that have been designated, and indeed this fact was pointed out a short time ago by Commissioner Dimas.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual cost of Natura 2000 has now been estimated by the Commission to be EUR 6.1 billion. This is a great deal of money, yet at the same time it is very little for all 25 Member States, depending on the final scope of the programme. At present management plans for SACs have to be drawn up on a national and regional basis, and it is not hard to see that each area will have varying requirements when it comes to a field as complex as environmental protection, and that different measures will therefore need to be put in place. Questions still remain, such as the instances in which greater expenditure will become necessary, and whether there should be changes to land use, given that this would mean a shortfall in income and financial losses for agricultural undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds. This is a source of some concern to me, and it would mean that a struggle for funding of the kind referred to by Mr Florenz would be inevitable. A separate financial instrument must be created that allows compensation to be granted in every instance where restrictions have been imposed as a result of Natura 2000 sites being designated.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mrs Haug, is what the farmers are calling for. It is intolerable that an increase in funding for SAC compensation should occur at the expense of agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes. Sufficient funding must be provided by the European Union for any additional tasks and costly obligations it imposes. This would then safeguard the substance of Natura 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My country, which represents 16% of the European Union’s territory, contains 40% of the entire Natura 2000 Network: 25% of Spanish territory is included in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Natura 2000, however, has a cost that has not so far been calculated precisely. The EUR 6 100 million calculated by the Commission could be very far from accurate, because this figure does not take sufficient account of the spending on compensation which could have been paid to landowners and farmers who, in reality, are deprived of the use of their land and the rights over it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should remember that, as well as for managing natural resources, we should compensate them for loss of revenue, as laid down in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, included in the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Natura 2000 Network is a Community initiative, and the European Union must therefore take responsibility not just for the cost of managing the areas, but also for the loss of revenue for the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström’s proposal to fund part of this cost by means of the rural development policy indicates that the Commission is not taking the Natura 2000 Network seriously or that it undervalues rural development, or both.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must choose between these two objectives; one always at the expense of the other. If the proposal being presented on the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, with a funding of EUR 11 000 million per year, is accepted, we would have to deduct 20% of that sum in order to fund a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the reform of the CAP in September 2003 extended the list of actions to be funded from rural development, adding to it improving quality, food safety and the welfare of livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">The Natura 2000 Network is therefore very important and requires an instrument for funding, either exclusively or by improving the sum for rural development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a political gulf between the priorities set for the Community and the lack of clarity regarding financing. It is worthy of you, Commissioner Dimas, that you should express a wish, as you did at the start of this debate, to safeguard the financing of Natura 2000. In addition, we also need effective tools to make your wish a reality. We need a special fund.</p>
<p class="contents">A key challenge for the European Union is to protect the diversity of nature in the area we all share. Diversity is an all-important issue and for that reason it does not need to be justified separately here. Every Member State has committed itself to this by drawing up a list of its conservation areas in accordance with the Habitats Directive. From the point of view of nature conservation policy, the Natura 2000 network is unique, because it protects the environment of approximately 200 habitat types and 700 species, and will soon cover more than 17% of the EU’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Natura 2000 network requires considerable input on the part of the Member States. The areas must not see any significant reduction in the natural resources which qualify them for inclusion in the Natura network. The authorities must likewise draft an appraisal of the environmental impact in all projects and plans that may have an effect on the natural worth of the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As this wide-ranging impact of the Natura 2000 network on all current and planned conservation area activity will demand a good deal in the way of resources and financial investment from the EU Member States, we really must ensure that sufficient, comprehensive funding is assigned at EU level to the administration of the Natura 2000 network by means of a separate financial instrument.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concludes, as the Commissioner pointed out, that the creation of a new financial instrument is not the appropriate formula. I completely agree with this point of view, even though it has not been expressed a great deal here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Natura 2000 areas proposed by the Member States are eligible as priorities, in the majority of cases, for the Cohesion and Structural Funds, and could be priorities for benefiting from Life funds for the costs of managing and monitoring the programmes. Why, therefore, should we want to distinguish the funding of Natura 2000 programmes from the funding of regional or rural policies? The actions in both cases are very much linked, whether the objectives are related to local development, protecting environments or maintaining biodiversity. There would be a huge risk that Natura 2000 would become completely disconnected from everything that was done elsewhere in the areas concerned. The obstacles encountered during the long – or even very long – period of defining the Natura 2000 areas would be multiplied, and the isolation of this mechanism, which is supposed to be exemplary, would be even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">The other risk would be that it would be excessively complex to implement and manage programmes. This would result in an increase in operational costs and create the impression of a monumental technocracy that would be rejected by the populations concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be pointed out that the forecast costs of the programmes are very variable depending on the country and the Natura 2000 areas chosen. Intelligent use of the Structural Funds, to which additional funds under Life could possibly be added, would, in my view, enable us to respond to them much better than with a specific financial instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why priority was given at the national policy level to setting up the Natura<span class="italic"> </span>2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, now that the inventory of territories to be protected and their importance for preserving biological diversity are fully understood, the resources for maintaining them may be lacking. The Commission has announced that it supports funding Natura 2000 from the Rural Development Funds and the Structural Funds. It has not, however, planned to create a specific financial instrument designed for the network. I believe that particularly in the new Member States, where there is intense competition at the local project level to obtain resources from Structural Funds and the rural support funds, the European Union nature protection network does not have much prospect of obtaining match funding: this state of affairs should not be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we ought to create a new, unified environmental funding instrument. Second, we should welcome proposals to supplement the activities supported in the draft regulation with the following – allocating funding for the management of those habitats which will not find support within the framework of the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Funds, allocating funding for pilot projects in the field of environmental technologies, planning preparatory measures for future allocation of money from the Structural Funds. Only in such a way will accessible sources of funds complement each other in order to maintain Natura 2000, and will we achieve what we intended when creating the Natura 2000 programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes down to brass tacks, however, and the time comes to provide money for initiatives of this kind and to get them off the ground, a large number of those who had previously expressed their enthusiasm beat a pretty hasty retreat. The number of people who put themselves out in any way, or who are at least willing to do so, is small.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of teething problems have been experienced with regard to the implementation of Natura 2000 that could potentially have been avoided. For example, the Netherlands has taken the opportunity to ban hunting in many parts of the country, using Natura 2000 as a pretext. I believe that this has given rise to a great deal of opposition, and in fact Commissioner Wallström stated clearly during the previous parliamentary term that Natura 2000 is entirely compatible with hunting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that knowledge be shared and that uncertainties over application be resolved. I am firmly convinced that the officials in Mr Dimas’ DG have done splendid work in the past, yet no matter how much effort is expended, work of this kind cannot be carried out unless the groundwork has been laid. Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of landowners or agriculture, and compensation must be granted instead of depriving people of what is due to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of the common agricultural policy or rural development. Natura 2000 sites cover 15% of the old EU, and funding measures for the remaining 85% – not including cities and built-up areas – come under rural development and agriculture. No further reductions should be made to this large area, and I therefore believe that separate and ample funding would be the best solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that either a new fund will be created to finance Natura 2000, or that new provisions will be made to allocate more money to rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I should like to stress is that as a result of the decisions taken by Brussels to cap the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved modulation funds from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – it is inevitable that landowners and farmers will receive compensation for their efforts from this pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is quite clear is that there can be no question of the budget available being any less than that proposed by the previous Prodi Commission. It is impossible to have more Europe for less money when there are 25 Member States, and I am entirely opposed to property being encroached upon without appropriate compensation being granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, I consider it important that an opportunity be given to use the Life+ Programme to cover the deficit. I believe the present proposal should be amended to include an opportunity to make available EU cofinancing for the protection and restoration of habitats of European importance that lie outside agricultural or forested areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why Natura 2000 should be added to the Life+ regulation as a separately funded activity; also, it would be expedient in the case of Life+ to direct most of the funding for projects through the Member States. Here the actual contribution of each Member State to the EU Natura 2000 network should be taken into account, including the area of designated bird and nature protection areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One current problem is that neither the Structural Funds nor the Rural Development Fund take this Member State contribution to the Natura 2000 network into account, but rather, give preference to projects in more densely populated areas. Coming from Estonia, I can testify that one of Estonia’s unique assets is the existence of relatively extensive natural areas. Estonia’s projects encompass 16% of the country’s land area. The preservation of these areas is simpler and cheaper at the moment than the restoration of former natural areas in Central Europe. It is not, therefore, logical that a fund to support nature protection activities uses population density, but not the current preservation status of natural resources, as a criterion for funding.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, anyone who cares for the environment knows that the Member States cannot necessarily be trusted to make integration work. We have heard much about that this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the following point: some states have been very slow to designate Natura 2000 sites at all. Four countries – the Netherlands, France, Italy and Finland – have Court judgments against them for inadequate designation of special protection areas for birds. Only one country in the EU – the Netherlands – has completed its designation of special areas for conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">These sites make up the Natura 2000 list, so how can we possibly be happy to leave the financing to Member States when they cannot be trusted to nominate the sites? It is a triumph of hope over experience to suppose that Member States will provide adequate funding for Natura 2000, unless the incentives of specific co-financing for it are on offer via the EU budget. If and when Mr Dimas replies to the debate, I would like to ask him to give us some up-to-date news on exactly how Natura 2000 is progressing. Are a number of Member States still not in contact with the Commission on the designation of sites, or is the network now complete?</p>
<p class="contents">Second, those who want EU funding for all the Natura 2000 sites have to guard against overbidding. We need the assurance that care will be integrated into Natura 2000 via the structural funds. We also need funding via the annual bidding process for the special needs of certain Natura 2000 sites, possibly through the establishment of a biodiversity programme within the LIFE+ Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has never liked the LIFE Programme. It involves very few officials doing a lot of very hard work trying to track down what is happening to very small amounts of money. There is no doubt that it would be administratively convenient for the Commission completely to wind up the LIFE Programme <span class="italic">in toto.</span> But it would be wrong to do this, Commissioner. You might say that what you are trying to do is effective, but my colleagues and I believe it is wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know that, following the current discussions on the financial perspectives, there may not be sufficient funds even to cover the lines that until now have been funded by means of the rural development fund, let alone the new actions planned following the reform of September 2003, on improving safety, food quality and livestock welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, a fantasy to believe that, in this context, there will be money to pay for the enormous cost of Natura 2000. Less and less is known about the funding of this network, but we must acknowledge that we have never really known. Evidence of this is the designation of the areas for the Natura 2000 Network, which has been delayed by at least twelve years, since the adoption of the directive on habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Commission originally consulted civil society, all the actors — from the farmers to the ecological organisations — expressed their support for funding that initiative by means of a separate and single fund, since that would be the only way to oblige the European Union to make a funding effort. The Commission, however, took no notice of any of the actors involved in that initiative. Funding a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000 by means of rural development is not just a fantasy, but its inclusion within the context of agri-environmental measures could jeopardise the efforts of European farmers to respect the ecological conditions imposed on them by the recently implemented reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission says that nature conservation is one of its priorities, but at the end of the day it is miserly with the money and expects the farmers and landowners to take responsibility for its financial cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, thank you very much for that constructive debate. The Commission is fully aware of the importance of securing adequate Community cofinancing for Natura 2000, for which the lists have been approved for five of the six regions, with few gaps in the lists. All the new Member States have submitted their lists.</p>
<p class="contents">The integration approach as proposed is consistent with the intention of Article 8 of the Habitats Directive, which calls for cofinancing from existing funds. It also builds on existing practice, which is that the rural development and structural funds are already the most important sources of Community funding for the network. It is estimated that EUR 500 million is spent each year from rural development funds in support of agri-environment measures for Natura 2000 sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken note of the concerns with regard to the great limitations of the rural development and structural funds. In response to this, the latest proposals recognise the need to expand the funding opportunities for Natura 2000 compared with the existing situation. In both the rural development and structural fund regulations, funding for Natura 2000 is made more explicit and its scope extended. Of particular significance is the extension of funding for forestry areas in the new rural development regulation. The importance of this cannot be underestimated since forestry areas represent 30% of the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will ensure that the integration of Natura 2000 into existing funds is made more effective by including it as a priority in the strategic guidelines that will be issued to Member States when they commence the preparation of their structural fund programmes. In its negotiations with the Member States on the content of these programmes, the Commission will seek to ensure that the allocations for Natura 2000 match this declared Community priority. The Commission will also have to approve the national and operational programmes presented to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect to the proposal for LIFE+, I wish to stress that it is intended to continue to support Natura 2000. The Member States have the flexibility to set their own priorities and decide the amounts provided for Natura 2000. It may, therefore, be the case that Natura 2000 will attract a far higher percentage of the LIFE resources than is presently the case. Designating a precise amount for Natura 2000 in LIFE+ also risks giving the impression that it would be a dedicated fund capable of covering all the needs of the network.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is in line with the general principle of integration and simplification of all the other Commission proposals in the context of the Financial Perspectives. There are now ongoing discussions in the Council and in Parliament on the Commission draft regulation for LIFE+. If the European Parliament makes a proposal for an amendment during the legislative process, I will of course be prepared to examine it seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission proposals, without offering explicit guarantees, are still able to cover the financial needs for the Natura 2000 network. I encourage you, therefore, to give your support to the various Commission proposals currently before Parliament. I welcome your interest in Natura 2000 and look forward to working with Parliament to ensure its effective implementation as a current central pillar of Community biodiversity policy. Thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
