<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marek Sawicki, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, thank you for including this item in today’s proceedings. This debate is about fundamental issues. It is about European solidarity and the current state of European solidarity; it is about the responsibility of Europe – which means our own responsibility – for those who are weak, poor and excluded, often through no fault of their own.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to you all for the opportunity of telling you about the progress of work on this important dossier. I know that in March 2009 the European Parliament adopted the Siekierski report by a clear majority, and recently, in July 2011, it called for a solution to be found quickly so that the food programme can be continued in the remaining years of the funding period. Testimony to the importance of this programme for our citizens is seen in the fact that free EU food aid is being provided to 18 million people – and not just to people who are unemployed, homeless, migrants, elderly or socially underprivileged or to people who in different ways have fallen victim to circumstances, but also to families with many children and people who are bringing up children on their own. As you know, over 80 million people are at risk of poverty in the European Union, including 20 million children.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that thousands of local charities are involved in running the programme, and that there are hundreds – thousands – of volunteers who distribute the food to the poor. This is usually done by young people, and in this way they are learning to help others. For over 20 years, the programme has not only contributed to achievement of the objectives of the common agricultural policy, but has also contributed to the cultivation of civil society and to social development. We can also say that the programme is helping achieve the strategic objectives of Europe 2020. Millions of citizens and many charitable organisations are waiting to hear good news from Strasbourg and Brussels. There are undoubtedly many who are listening to this debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The current programme enables the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations, which distribute it among the most deprived people in the European Union. In recent years, the common agricultural policy has undergone a fundamental change. Intervention purchases as a tool for regulating the market have been completely withdrawn in the case of certain products or have been significantly reduced. As a consequence, the food aid programme’s dependence on purchases from the market has significantly increased in this time. Although work is still being carried out under the programme, the funding made available to it for next year has been significantly reduced. The fear exists that in 2013 this funding will be further reduced or even that nothing will be made available at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, here, to emphasise very strongly that the Presidency aims to forge a compromise which will make it possible to continue the programme in full. In Council the majority of Member States support the programme, but there is a minority which is blocking it. The countries which are against the programme argue their position in different ways. Most of them say that the programme supports the objectives of social policy and that this is the responsibility of the Member States, so in their opinion the European Union should not support poor people from the EU budget. I am afraid I find it hard to agree with such an approach. I do not want to criticise those Member States, because that is not the role of the Presidency. The word ‘solidarity’ in this case means help for those who are most in need. Let us remember that participation in the programme is voluntary. As the Commission says, there are no budget-related or legal objections to maintaining the programme. We have a sum of EUR 500 million reserved for the programme in the EU budget every year. The costs of running the programme are barely EUR 1 per citizen per year. Commissioner Cioloş has explained repeatedly that the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 13 April 2011 is not an obstacle to making a political decision. Five months after the judgment, the Commission has put forward an amended proposal in order to amend the contested legislation. Adoption of this proposal in its current or in a slightly modified form will solve the problem of the legality of making purchases from the market. Therefore, everything is in the hands of the Council and Parliament. The opponents of the programme have no grounds for using legal or technical matters as excuses. We need to say frankly that responsibility for the future of the programme lies on their shoulders. They must not react to this matter by burying their heads in the sand.</p>
<p class="contents">By restricting or ending the programme we will not reduce poverty – poverty will hit at the Europe we live in with double force. We should not be embarrassed about poverty – we should work actively to reduce it. As you know, the Commission has proposed that in the new Multiannual Financial Framework the funding of food aid should be moved from Heading 2 to Heading 1. In the opinion of the Commission, the principles of the programme mean that under Heading 1, in fact, it fits in better with the Europe 2020 strategy. At the right moment the Commission will put forward a new legislative proposal for the period beginning from 2014. Let us hope that the programme will then enjoy the support of all the Member States. Of course, the programme will not solve the problem of poverty, but it can contribute to its reduction. Even in the wealthiest of the EU’s Member States there are people in need, people who are going through problems. It is not just people from urban areas who are affected by poverty, but chiefly people who live in small towns or sparsely-populated rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The continuing economic crisis and rising unemployment mean that the number of people who cannot meet their basic needs is growing – they should be given help, and they must be given help by the European Union. For precisely this reason we have included the programme in the agenda for the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in September. The last debate in the forum of the Council was, at the request of the Polish Presidency, a public debate. Every citizen had the opportunity to follow it on the Internet. Unfortunately, for three years we have had an impasse in the Council over solutions to this problem. It is a pity that at a time of crisis, when the number of those in need of food is rising, social sensitivity and plain European solidarity is waning among some politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of the programme for food distribution to the most needy will probably be discussed in October at the Council of EU Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers. Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to assure you that the Presidency is doing everything it can to find a solution as part of current bilateral contacts with the governments of the Member States which are opposed to the proposal, both among Ministers for Agriculture and among Heads of State or Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some delegations are wondering whether a decision on this matter should not be made by the European Council on 17-18 October. In the next few days, I am going to send a letter about this to the President, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is fully aware that the Commission’s proposals enjoy the clear support of many Members of this House. Such support is also being declared by many of the Member States. I can only assure the House that we will make every effort to break the current deadlock and work out an agreed position in Council as soon as possible. Five previous presidencies have not been able to make progress and break the blocking minority, but I continue to believe that it will be possible to do this under my leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the House for supporting the programme, but would also like to ask you all for help in convincing the national governments and parliaments which oppose giving European Union food aid to the poorest people in the EU. I am very much counting on your help.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is confirmation that the European Union feels responsible for its most deprived citizens and that it promotes ideals of solidarity. Millions of the European Union’s citizens know that when they go through hard times the Union does not forget them. They can count on the help of Brussels and Strasbourg. It is inconceivable to me that the programme will not be continued in the future. It is not only the European Union and the EU institutions which would lose face, because we would all bring shame on ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we are all aware, following the serious economic crisis, the number of EU citizens who need these programmes in order to be fed has increased dramatically. The long queues that form outside charity organisations speak for themselves. Indeed, over the past 25 years we have had a programme that has proved its worth by supporting those organisations. A total of 440 000 tonnes of food a year is distributed to them, which constitutes more than half of what the food banks provide to the most deprived people in the Member States. Eighteen million people await our decision. An average of 18 million people benefit from this programme every year. Even though this programme exists and works properly, some want to see it disappear right at a time when we may need it more than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be clear on this point. The legal and financial issues that have arisen in order for the programme to continue can be resolved for 2012 and 2013. What is lacking is the political will on the part of a few. I would like to be clear on that point, as well: nobody can hide behind a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice ruling does not challenge the advisability of this programme. Rather, it challenges the legal basis, which needs to be updated, and it is precisely the role of the political institutions to decide on the amendments that should be made to that legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">From that perspective, the European Commission has made a clear choice, because, within its proposals for the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period following 2013, it has offered to include these programmes in its economic and social cohesion policy, with a budget of EUR 2.5 million for the period 2014-2020. The aim of this is to ensure these programmes continue. For 2012 and 2013, a period that is currently under threat and needs urgent attention, the Commission’s proposal – which the Council has been debating since 2008 and which I amended in September 2010 in order to take your comments into account – would allow us to bridge the gap between current regulations, which limit purchases to intervention stocks, and 2014, after which we will also have a new legal basis within the framework of social cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Sawicki said, I have already warned the Council that, if it does not take this decision immediately, given that Parliament has already expressed its view, the 2012 plan will only constitute one quarter of that of past years. For 2013 there would be no plan at all, because it is unlikely that we would have significant intervention on the market so as to make public stocks available. If there is no amendment to the current regulation by means of the political decision that the Council needs to take, we run the risk of not being able to allocate a single euro to the 2013 programme, even though the budget exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you today for the continued support you have shown on this issue, and particularly for recently adopting the resolution of 7 July 2011, which stresses the need to find an agreement enabling this programme to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware that many of you have spoken out in favour of the continued full financing of these programmes by the EU budget. In that respect, I have shown considerable flexibility as regards the conditions required in order for all interested Member States to be able to take part. I have also shown the Council that I am ready to be flexible if the Council can manage to find a majority in order to take this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I took note of the discussion that took place in the Council on 20 September 2011; the Commission is currently looking at solutions to try to end this deadlock, and potentially to propose a shared legal basis for the common agricultural policy (CAP) and social policies so that it will be available for 2012 and 2013. I hope to be able to find a solution to this political issue in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am counting on your active support in order to reach a swift agreement, because I think this is another opportunity to show that Europe does not just mean Brussels and Strasbourg, but rather that Europe is active in the field, and this scheme is a perfect example of a programme that works in the field. It is my belief that we should not be afraid to take political responsibility for this Europe that takes action in the field. We believe that this ideal should be put into practice on a daily basis, and I am certain that you will remain faithful to that ideal and to that principle of carrying out specific actions in the field and thereby show our citizens that Europe takes action in that way and shows solidarity.</p>

Pensioners with less money are saving on food to be able to buy medicines. Many of them, just like many unemployed people, benefit from the free distribution of food.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we now have around 80 million people living below or on the poverty line. What are we to say to the people who ask us why the Union is making cuts in spending on the free distribution of food in this situation? As part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, intervention buying is being progressively reduced. Does the falling number and amount of products being held in intervention stocks mean we have to cut back on the provision of free food to those who do not have enough to eat?</p>
<p class="contents">Not long ago, we discussed this issue here in plenary. Virtually everyone unequivocally declared themselves in favour of maintaining the free distribution of food at the current level. I ask, therefore, why the voice of parliamentarians, who have a mandate from the electorate, is not being taken into consideration? I think we should be very aggrieved at this, because while the EU institutions so often appeal to the need to maintain solidarity, create equal opportunities and tackle exclusion, what credibility can they have in this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be reiterated that the fight against poverty is one of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. I am pleased that the importance of the programme for the free distribution of food in mitigating the effects of the crisis has been recognised by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who mentioned it in his speech today in the debate on the state of the Union. I appeal to the governments and the fellow Members from the Member States which are blocking the allocation of suitable resources to this commendable purpose, and would also like to ask them to change their position. In the draft Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020, a sum of EUR 2.5 billion has been reserved for this purpose, or EUR 350 million per year, whereas until now the programme has been receiving EUR 500 million per year, so this means a reduction of 30%. Therefore, the level of funds for the operation of this programme should be increased in the new financial framework to EUR 3.5 billion per year, so that we can maintain ...</p>

The most basic common sense and feeling of solidarity should already have resolved the problem that we are here today to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the estimate of the European Union itself, in Europe, which we consider to be the exponent of prosperity, freedom and justice, there are currently more than 40 million people at risk of food poverty, that is, without access to a full meal every two days.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, 440 000 tonnes of food were distributed to about 18 million people. No one is in any doubt that the situation will be worse in 2012. The economic and financial crisis, which continues to escalate, has thrown many people and families into unemployment against a backdrop of drastic cuts to social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the six Member States that blocked legislation enabling funding for food aid in 2012 to be maintained at the level of previous years is therefore incomprehensible and unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I welcome the gesture of the Commission – represented by you, Commissioner – which has tried to find a suitable legal solution to circumvent the issue raised by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the Council reveals a shocking social insensitivity which goes against all the values on which European integration is based. I therefore completely denounce the recent position of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and call upon the Polish Presidency and the Heads of State or Government to resolve this problem once and for all at their next meeting, to overrule their Ministers for Agriculture, and to once again espouse the idea of solidarity and justice characteristic of Europe, which some ministers unfortunately seem to have forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion – and I want to make this very clear – this programme belongs in social policy and not European agricultural policy. I believe that perhaps we should go further, and it should be a national responsibility. That is why we will support the move proposed by the Commission in its post-2014 MFF, which seeks a long-term solution to the problem and paves a way for a solution to be found when it is moved from Heading 1 to Heading 2.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation we face today concerning the next two years of this programme is completely and utterly unacceptable. We need to find a swift solution. The risk is clear. The money available to charities in 20 Member States will drop from EUR 500 million to only EUR 113 million if the Council continues to block a solution, leaving over 18 million poor in need who normally benefit from the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a scandalous situation that we find ourselves in. It is not acceptable to let this happen in 21st century Europe, especially at a time of crisis. We need to urge the Council to take their responsibilities seriously. Regardless of whether you believe the programme should be national or whether it should be moved to social policy, there is a duty to find a way forward to solve the problem for the next two years and to find a transitional solution to unlock the situation for the coming two years. The Council should work together with the Commission and Parliament to end this short-term deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to find a proper, agreed, solid basis for the long-term future of this programme. It is unacceptable that the poor should be taken hostage by this legal dispute and this inability of the Council to find a common line. It is now time that national governments took their responsibilities seriously and worked together with the Commission and this Parliament to come up with a quick solution that ensures that those who need this programme for the years 2012 and 2013 are satisfied and that their needs are met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I recognise this has helped over 18 million people and has done a tremendous job throughout the whole of the European Union in many areas where it is implemented, we are now in a position where the funding is seriously being questioned. We have to deal with this, and the Minister made it clear that stocks in 2013 are going to be more limited than they will have been in 2012. That is a reality. We all know that the security of food supply is not there as it has been in the past, and this is a tremendous challenge for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">But like the previous speaker, let me say I have to question whether this should come out of an agricultural budget or the social budget. I think we have to get it right. We cannot just simply fudge something because we disagree with it in many ways, so which fund would pay? I think this is the bottom line and question. I would ask Commissioner Cioloş whether this fund is effective and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know about the waste of food and we have talked about the food that is being wasted throughout Europe. Is this the best way to deal with poverty?

More than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. The situation is critical. Today, six Member States want to put an end to the food aid programme with no replacement solution: Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Admittedly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has made a ruling and we have to respect it. Nevertheless, Commissioner, in June 2011, Parliament called on you, on the initiative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and you made appropriate proposals in order to protect the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Verts/ALE Group is ready to work with you on long-term solutions; however, given that millions of people depend on this scheme, we cannot allow the food aid budget to be reduced by three-quarters. This is absolutely urgent. If nothing is done before the end of the year, the food banks will be lacking almost EUR 300 million, and there is no guarantee that the national governments will be able to step up to bridge that gap. This is therefore a real question of solidarity between people. We cannot allow a minority of irresponsible governments to deprive millions of Europeans of their food aid, because this is first and foremost a matter of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty and malnutrition also requires a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). We need to make fundamental changes to our production methods in order to bring food production closer to the people, particularly the poorest, who also have a right to a healthy, balanced diet.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future. The Council needs to see reason, and let those in need have recourse to this vital aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am addressing the future Danish Government in particular, who will be responsible for taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January. They need to see reason. Will it take hunger riots in Europe in order for us to realise the urgent need to change our way of thinking? When it comes to saving the banks, the Council finds solutions, but when it is a matter of saving the food banks, nobody is interested.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament spoke some strong words last time, when we said that human beings are more important than finance. It is high time we reasserted that. In any case, Parliament will be extremely vigilant, and we will not hesitate to renew our call in a constructive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When the charges for communal services and medication are deducted from this amount, there is virtually nothing left for food. If Mr Sawicki’s statement is true that it costs one euro for each citizen of the European Union to participate in the programme, this means that Bulgarian pensioners have contributed EUR 2.5 million from their money, which is inadequate even without this contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the programme in question does not operate in my country. Even though I want to add my voice to those of all my colleagues who spoke before me and I think that this programme must be continued, I would like to call on the Commissioner and the Commission to take measures to make this programme available to all the European Union’s citizens in need in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank Ms Zimmer for naming those countries which are currently blocking the decision in the Council. Since she mentioned them quickly due to the short duration of her speech, I would like to ask Mr Sawicki to repeat the names of these countries so that all of us and all European citizens who are here in the gallery and are watching us on the Internet can also hear who is blocking this decent social decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have heard, a political decision is required to ensure that this takes place. However, the responsibility for this important area lies primarily with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable that people in Europe do not have enough to eat. It is part of the social responsibility of the Member States to ensure that they do. In Germany there are laws which guarantee sufficient food for all the citizens of the country. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union has changed the framework of the current aid programme. Strict limits have been set on market purchases. The Court has determined that the current programme in its current form does not comply with the legal basis of the Treaties. I know that we need to find answers in order to guarantee that the millions of needy people in the EU are given help. However, I would like to stress once again that the socio-political responsibility lies with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should also consider whether it would be better to establish programmes in the Member States rather than one European programme. These would be cofinanced with social funding from Brussels, in order to guarantee the provision of food aid in all Member States. This would also safeguard European solidarity, which I am firmly committed to, and enable the programmes to be continued. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will certainly help to find solutions for the people who are affected. I was once travelling in Brazil with a group of people when some young Brazilians asked us if they could have the food that we had left on our plates. I was shocked that something like this could happen in a rich agricultural country. We must make sure that people in Europe have enough to eat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This number unfortunately includes many children and looks set to rise at a time when access to food is defined as a fundamental right. We therefore cannot but express incomprehension and opposition when faced with the blocking minority in favour of cutting aid which has emerged within the Council of Ministers for Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the Court of Justice’s ruling and we will work to ensure that from 2013 there will be a text which will, of course, take account of the Court’s comments, but we certainly cannot allow this programme to be interrupted. I believe that, while Europe is today discussing a EUR 500 million programme of aid to its internal population, in the United States for over 40 years the US ‘Fair Deal’ law has been providing aid to the US population with a programme worth more than USD 20 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore argue that we must all redouble our efforts and in this respect I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and Mr Sawicki, and to commend Mr Cioloş, who has taken this matter to heart with courage and determination. We must find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The blocking minority in Council towards this programme is unacceptable. Opposition to this scheme on the basis of competence, bureaucracy or budget are semantics that mean nothing to those who are hungry and rely on this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the five objectives of the EU 2020 strategy is the reduction of poverty and social exclusion in the European Union. This programme represents a real method of physically addressing poverty that delivers immediate results. While it does not address the root causes of poverty it improves the immediate situation for those who cannot afford to feed themselves or their families. Sometimes we need to take the small goals and not always be looking at the ideological bigger picture.</p>
<p class="contents">Many EU programmes addressing poverty and social inclusion are very well intentioned and well written but they often stay on paper without ever benefiting the EU citizens they are targeting. This programme directly assists organisations and currently provides food for 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States and has distribution chains involving some 240 food banks and charities. That is real and measurable assistance on the ground, directly benefiting those who need it most and not just an aspirational goal.</p>
<p class="contents">A little bit of common sense if not some compassion is required from EU leaders on this issue and I welcome the comments by the President of the Commission on this earlier today and also the contributions from the Commissioner and the Minister earlier in this debate. Now is not the time to be playing politics with such an important programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that more than 43 million people are in a situation of extreme food poverty and at risk of food poverty, including 20 million children, and that even here in Europe people are sometimes obliged to rummage through bins because they have no food at home, it is unacceptable that this programme should be reduced from EUR 500 million to only EUR 113 million in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that poverty requires other fundamental measures rather than so-called austerity measures, which are only exacerbating poverty and social exclusion, and it is vital to take into account Parliament’s resolution of 4 July, which includes the promotion of an agreement on guaranteed minimum income, based on 60% of the average national income of each Member State.</p>

It is also undoubtedly the case that this programme will make us more popular and I believe that we are living in an era where popularity will not do us any harm.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that a relatively short time ago we adopted the Europe 2020 agenda in this House, which states that reducing poverty is one of our goals for 2020. If today we cancel a programme which is moving in this direction, this is not a consistent approach, taking into consideration the fact that food will definitely not become cheaper over the next few years, but in fact will be more expensive. This programme must be a genuine programme for combating poverty and it must be implemented together with the Member States, which are ultimately responsible for social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It must not be a programme which, as in some other countries, and the United States has already been mentioned, is simply an instrument of agricultural policy and which is aimed primarily at reducing surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we do not need the orders of magnitude that are used, for example, in the United States and that involve a significant percentage of the overall agricultural budget. Our agricultural policy works in a quite different way.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it will be essential in the short term, in other words during the current financial framework, to restart this programme and to ensure that it continues. In the long term, we will have to consider on the basis of the court ruling whether the goal can better be achieved using other methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, there is an impending food disaster, because we are making ready to abolish food aid to the poorest at a time when it should be increased.</p>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, Commissioner, there are fewer agricultural measures, as was said earlier, but there are still export subsidies. There are, therefore, appropriations.

This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil.</p>
<p class="contents">Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens.</p>

We are all of the same opinion, though there are divergent views on the methods to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it should be reiterated that it is not Europe that is responsible; it is the six governments of the countries that have already been mentioned, but which need to be mentioned again: the governments of Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden. What is more, these countries are not among the poorest in the European Union, but they are among the most selfish – or are becoming selfish. What those countries really need to understand is that they must take their responsibilities seriously. Do they want to be responsible for, guilty of, and complicit in not giving assistance to people in danger? That is in fact what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is worth maintaining, especially at a time of crisis, and for the 10 million most deprived citizens of Europe. In three months it will be winter. Solutions must be found, of course, for after 2014 but, more importantly, transitional solutions must be found for 2012 and 2013. We must adhere to the letter of the law; we must withdraw the agriculture budget and transfer it to social cohesion under the heading ‘Fund for the most deprived’. Europe must not shirk its responsibilities. The Member States are, of course, jointly responsible, but Europe cannot ‘cop out’ when it comes to this very important social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, 18 million Europeans benefit from this programme. This means that more than one European in 30 has received food aid. The whole EU is battling against the repercussions of the crisis, and the risk of poverty has increased. The fight against social exclusion is one of the most important aims of the European Union’s social policy, and the lack of food is the toughest of all forms of exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Just this morning President Barroso said here before us in Parliament that the intention of political institutions is to make possible what is necessary. This is why I firmly believe that solutions can be found to get us out of the current legal stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the costs involved with food aid are concerned, we should remember that every European citizen produces 180 kilograms of food refuse every year, which is an astounding level of waste. This means that every year half of the food in Europe is thrown away and turned into refuse. Limiting this waste would enable us to provide the necessary food to all the poor people in Europe and more. It is ethically unacceptable to ignore these people.

As a Social Democrat, it is important to me to help needy people. However, for me the focus is primarily on creating jobs, in order to enable people to take care of themselves. In my opinion, the food aid programme for needy people in its current form is not the right way of helping people to help themselves. I see this as charity, which is damaging to people’s dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems relatively clear to me that buying food and distributing it free of charge to needy people is not agricultural policy. It falls within the realms of social policy. Under the terms of the current legal basis, social policy is a matter for the Member States. In Germany there is a system of food banks. Volunteer helpers collect food which can no longer be used by supermarkets, for example. Given the fact that 89 million tonnes of food goes to landfill every year in Europe, initiatives of this kind make sense, but they are also charitable in nature. Let us create sensible infrastructures to ensure that people do not have to rely on charity. This means, for example, allowing them to be independent by providing good jobs and good pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘Food for Free’ programme urgently needs to be maintained, especially in the current social crisis. As such, the drastic cuts in funds proposed for 2012 are unacceptable. We are calling directly for a new legal framework, so that full use can be made of funds available in the current financial period and the programme can continue after 2013. Apart from the need for agricultural produce to be supplied from government stocks and from the market, the selection of products distributed must not be restricted to products subject to intervention and the facility should be provided for a broader choice in each Member State, based on real needs. The Commission recommends the introduction of financing. Of course we understand the difficulty, if not the impossibility, that this proposal implies for certain Member States that have greater need of the programme. Finally, to those asking for food programmes to be renationalised under each Member State’s social policies, I would reply that, apart from its social dimension, the programme helps to stabilise agricultural markets and farmers’ income in the Union. More to the point, it symbolises a minimum expression of solidarity with its destitute citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Worse still, this trend may be growing.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is for the Commission to find a proper basis for the existing food programme and any new one. Suddenly stopping and drastically reducing the aid provided causes more harm in the long term than good in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few more important points to make. This aid must certainly be granted to those who really need it so as to prevent dependency on it. However, dependency can be overcome by providing opportunities for these people to develop. Dire need should not, in most cases, be confused with dependency either.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the role of the Structural Funds and their suitability is very important. However, they are also based on the importance of ensuring that people have good-quality, healthy nutrition, right from childhood and for the whole of their life. Our role is to help people so that shortage of food does not lead to dependency and dependency does not preclude development.</p>
<p class="contents">On a global scale, more general actions such as those involving the UN agency send a very powerful message which the European Union is conveying outside our continent. Finally, the fight against hunger is a Millennium Development Goal. Even more importantly than this, we are fighting for a new CAP, which cannot be allowed to sustain differences and create new injustices.</p>

The programme has proved to be an important instrument for certain groups of people affected by poverty, especially against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis. This is why I think that the EU needs to provide support to deprived persons at a comparable level to this year, in the knowledge that the common agricultural policy has a social element. After all, people in need have still to be given assistance. Based on the principle of European solidarity, the six Member States must prove that they understand the situation of the groups suffering poverty and agree to continue the programme under the necessary conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that the Council will be watched closely in this regard and that it must prove itself worthy of the founding values of Europe and crush this pitiful blocking minority. To the European Commission I would like to say that it is logical to back your proposal, Commissioner, to link the PEAD to the European Social Fund. However, the European Social Fund is the most important tool of social integration through professional integration. I therefore ask that it be fully preserved and that it be supplemented by the food aid needed by the most deprived. We will be extremely vigilant on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third message is to Parliament. All the Members of Parliament in this House are fully committed to this programme.

We want this programme to continue because of its humanitarian aspect. I was listening to the lengthy debate and I was just wondering whether those who benefit from meals at the food bank are troubled by the legal base under which the food they are eating comes? Do they worry about the sort of detail that we worry about in this Parliament? There are plenty of brains in this room to come up with a solution. I do not want to condemn the Member States who are blocking this; I do not think that is a good way forward. I want to try and persuade them of the value of this programme for the solidarity of the European Union. I want to see a short-term solution for the next two years but I would also like, as Jim Nicholson has said, to review what we might do post-2014. Sometimes you need to do things differently, but we have an immediate problem. For example, there is in Ireland EUR 1 million which will be lost for food aid, so a short-term solution is needed.

<p class="contents">It is absolutely unacceptable that a few Member States, which do not even participate in this programme, are preventing Europe from moving forward in its solidarity and support.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dacian Cioloş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to provide some information and clarify a few points following the comments made by some of you, not to convince those who are already convinced of the need to keep this programme going, but perhaps to send messages to those who need to hear them.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that a social policy programme is, perhaps, a programme at national level. Why should this programme not fall within social policy? As I have already said, the Commission has made its choice: for the period 2014-2020, it proposes to include the budget for this programme in social inclusion and cohesion policy. That is possible. Should it be a national matter? I think it is a political decision that needs to be taken here and, in my opinion, the majority is going to opt for the period 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we are currently asking ourselves concerns the years 2012 and 2013. For that period, Parliament, like the Council, was in agreement, when adopting the budget, that the programme would fall under the common agricultural policy (CAP). It is true that things have changed, but I wish to confirm and further strengthen the idea that the Court of Justice of the European Union does not call a regulation into question. The Court of Justice of the European Union simply requests that a regulation in force be complied with. The Commission is now proposing to amend this regulation so that we can make progress. It is not up to the Court of Justice to take political decisions. I think there are bodies in Europe to do that. The Commission calls on the institutions that have to take political decisions to take them. The Commission has done its work by putting forward a legislative proposal taking account of the observations of the Court of Justice, However the Court of Justice does not limit purchases on the markets. It simply says that the regulation currently in force does not permit them. So let us change the regulation. A regulation is made to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this programme will be integrated into social policy as of 2014 does not prevent us from taking the decision today – as I said – with a common legal basis. We are maintaining the legal basis for agriculture because, for 2012, we have stocks of more than EUR 100 million. For 2012, therefore, this programme cannot fall within social policy alone, because we have stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to maintain the dual legal basis – the CAP and social policy. That is what it will propose at the Employment and Social Affairs Council, which will take place early next week. I hope that the Employment and Social Affairs Council or the next Agricultural Council will arrive at a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Comments were also made concerning cofinancing. A number of Member States were unable to afford the cofinancing proposed by the Commission in the legislative proposal on the table. As I have said on a number of occasions, the Commission is prepared to look again at this cofinancing idea if that is what is blocking the decision. It is my hope that we will be able to take a decision, because I know that the Polish Presidency is just as determined as the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the effectiveness of these funds – an issue raised by Mr Nicholson – and waste, we will have a chance to see how, as of 2014, we will be able to improve the functioning of this programme. As to its effectiveness, it is one of the programmes for which figures are available: 440 million tonnes are being distributed to 18 million beneficiaries. There are clearly beneficiaries behind the use of this money. This money – these EUR 500 million a year – which we have used until now, is often used as leverage to collect products that are not wasted. As you know, mass distribution retail shops also frequently contribute, along with food banks, to topping up reserves intended for the most deprived. This money is also used as leverage. In the Member States, the overall value of the programme is well in excess of EUR 500 million, but this money is used as leverage.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the points I wanted to make, once again, in the hope – and I could almost say the conviction – that, with the Council, we will be able to find a majority of MEPs to enable this programme to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not yet too late but, in a few months’ time, it could be. I hope that will not be the case.</p>

It was then that the blocking minority came into being. As you know, since that time we have now had six presidencies, and beginning with the French Presidency, each of them has passed this difficult problem on, like a hot potato, to the next one. I would like to say very clearly that the Polish Presidency does not want to share this issue with the next presidency. We will make every effort for this problem to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to point out that as a politician I am a little ashamed that the blocking group consists of Member States which formerly benefited very substantially from market intervention instruments and when stocks were high saw nothing wrong in giving them to those who were most in need. Today, when there are no intervention stocks, we have made this into an artificial legal problem. However, the Commissioner is saying clearly that this is neither a legal problem, nor is it a financial problem, it is a problem of a political decision. Indeed, you have adopted the ‘six pack’ here today to secure the financial situation of the big banks. Are those six governments not ashamed that no decision has been made about small change for 18 million people?</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that this is a public debate here, today. I did not have my head in the sand last week when I raised the subject in public debate in Council, so that European society would have a clear idea of who is blocking this decision and why, and now I trust, Mr President, I trust that after this debate the consciences of the governments which are blocking the decision will be reawakened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ‘Food for Free’ programme is targeted at people who worry whether they will be able to feed their children tomorrow; people who do not think about what they will eat that night for dinner, but about whether they will have anything to eat, and people who only eat in soup kitchens. I agree that we must do more to guarantee the nutritional quality of the food distributed. It is important that good-quality food is provided, which is as fresh as possible. I think that today’s debate should send out a very clear message: do not forget about those waiting at the soup kitchen or waiting to receive the next food parcel. Therefore, we must not wait too long. We must establish this food aid programme on a permanent basis for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is the risk that in 2013 the programme will stop due to opposition from six EU Member States to the possibility of continuing to support the most deprived citizens from the common agricultural policy budget, as has happened until now.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the technical discussion about transferring food aid from the EU agriculture budget to Member States’ social budgets, there is actually a lack of political will from the six governments from Central and Western Europe to contribute to a solidarity programme for Europe’s poorest citizens, at a time when their number is steadily rising due to the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say how much I appreciate the readiness shown by Commissioner Dacian Cioloș to come up with a solution for continuing the food aid programme, a system introduced back in 1987 by the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors.</p>

At a time when increasing numbers of Europeans are feeling the effect of the banking crisis and are in need of food aid, these countries are turning off the tap. Not because they have no money, but because they think that this kind of social policy is better left to the exclusive competence of Member States. That is typical of a liberal vision of Europe that only has an economic, and rarely a social, dimension. They are still failing to understand the fact that a strong European social policy, which guarantees every Member State minimum rights, brings benefits to all. It is, therefore, no surprise that the obstructions to this are those countries which are pushing for a harsh austerity policy without addressing the social consequences. Neither is it a coincidence that precisely these countries are more and more openly calling European solidarity into question. One of the signals we have already received is the fact that these countries have been undermining, in a brutal and irresponsible fashion, the commendable work of many volunteers working for food banks, non-profit organisations and charities as part of the European Year of Volunteering. They would be better to follow the example of the selfless work of thousands of volunteers in order to build a better society and one with greater solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This political posturing, at such an inopportune moment, is terrible for the image of the EU. At a time when, with winter approaching, the vulnerability of the most deprived is at its highest, we are jeopardising the essential work of the European food banks. Although this programme represents only 1% of the budget of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and benefits more than 13 million Europeans in need each year, the idea that savings can be made at its expense therefore seems to me totally inappropriate and intolerably cynical. The ball is now in the court of the Council, which absolutely must come to its senses at the next meeting of agriculture ministers.
