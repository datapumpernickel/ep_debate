Innovation is the key to Europe’s prospects of becoming more competitive on a global level. Protection of intellectual property is of crucial importance, because IPR not only rewards investment in new products and services but also ensures the transfer of technology stimulating further innovation. The recent consultation on the future of the patent system in Europe delivered one simple message: the legal framework should offer an affordable patent protection for all businesses, small and big, ensure legal certainty and be applied for the benefit of all players. A solid legal framework is therefore essential. I must repeat that we need to keep up. Compared to our major trading partners, Europe is losing ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent remains blocked in the Council, but recognising the economic importance of patents, I felt that it was not a good thing to leave the entire patent agenda in limbo. So, earlier this year, as you know, I launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on future patent policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation has shown that industry favours the Commission’s effort to simplify the patent system in Europe and to make it more cost-effective. There are two major issues here: languages, or translation costs, on the one hand and the jurisdictional system on the other. There is strong support for the introduction of a Community patent. However, industry is not enamoured of the political compromise reached in the Council in 2003 on the Community patent. It rejects the proposed solutions on both language and the jurisdictional system because they do not achieve the cost reductions and simplification of the patent system that industry is calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is also a strong call for the improvement of the existing European patent system, established by the Munich Convention, by the successful conclusion of a European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) on jurisdiction, and by the ratification and entry into force of the London Agreement on language arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that no single initiative for the improvement of the EU patent system has received unanimous support from stakeholders. Different stakeholders highlight different aspects, and many suggest that a package of different measures is needed, which should be implemented in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore convinced that we need to take a multi-faceted approach. In order to succeed, we should tackle all the patent issues in one package. That package will have to respond to stakeholders’ criticism and needs. We will only succeed if we can demonstrate that what we propose will have added value compared to the status quo<span class="italic">,</span> in particular, regarding costs of patenting (translation costs) and legal certainty (jurisdictional system). We are currently working on the options for the way forward and will present them in a communication and action plan, which the Commission should adopt before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">A key component of this work concerns the jurisdictional issue. At present, although business has a one-stop shop where it can acquire a patent (the EPO), it may find itself defending the patent on several fronts at once. That is because the patents granted by the European Patent Office are in fact a bundle of national patents and can only be enforced by national courts. The possibility of multi-forum litigation concerning the same invention naturally adds cost, but even more importantly it creates uncertainty, as different courts in different countries can deliver diverging interpretations on the same patented invention. We need to tackle that issue as a matter of urgency. The current ‘patchwork’ may prevent patent holders from being able to enforce their rights and it discourages candidates, in particular SMEs looking for efficient and affordable patent protection, from using the European patent. Europe is, at present, unable to offer innovative businesses an optimal solution when it comes to protecting their intellectual property. We cannot aspire to be the most competitive economy in the world if we do not find workable solutions for patent application and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent and the initiatives to improve the European patent, that is, the London Agreement on translations and the EPLA, are not mutually exclusive. They both aim for the same goal: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system. That is why I want to pursue both. We face similar challenges in designing the jurisdictional arrangements for the Community patent: we need to find a unified system that provides judicial independence and gives clarity and reliability to patent users while avoiding both over-centralisation and fragmentation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve that objective, the Community needs to get involved in the EPLA, which addresses shared responsibilities between Member States and the Community. It goes without saying that Parliament will have to contribute when the Community proceeds with the required proposals, in order to take this issue forward in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of some critical voices against the EPLA. Let me just say that I see the EPLA as a practical initiative to bring greater unity to the case law on patents in Europe. And legal certainty is what our industry, big and small alike, need. There are hundreds of thousands of patents granted by the EPO. Even if we had a Community patent, there would be a need to streamline the jurisdiction process for EPO-granted patents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to get involved in this initiative to ensure that it serves the competitiveness of our economy. I recognise that there are legitimate doubts and concerns: the cost of litigation under the EPLA, the impact of the rules of procedure, which we have yet to see, and the independence of the EPLA judges from the EPO. But I am convinced that the best way to confront these problems is by engaging actively with the process and by securing an outcome that is satisfactory and fair to all concerned and in full conformity with EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, neither the Community patent nor the EPLA are a panacea. There will always be businesses – the smaller ones – that prefer to deal with their national patent offices, or to use business models that do not rely on patents. We need to look at ways in which we can help and support them. And, of course, we need to ensure that large companies do not abuse their position, either by unfairly exploiting their own patents or by unfairly ignoring the patent rights of others.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation threw up many such issues, for example, the possible mediation mechanisms that could precede litigation, the need to create technology markets that would enable businesses to trade their IPR more successfully, and the idea of exchanging best practice between national patent offices, especially in terms of the special needs of SMEs. I will be responding to all these issues, in cooperation with my colleagues in the Commission, and therefore intend to propose a comprehensive strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a 21st-century global and knowledge-based economy, we urgently need to find a solution to the patent issue. I count upon Parliament’s support in finding a comprehensive solution to these rather complex issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaus-Heiner Lehne, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for two years now, I have been one of the two rapporteurs in the European Parliament's steering group for the Lisbon process. As you know, we launched the Lisbon process together in 2000, and, since then, we have worked tirelessly to point out, in declarations of the Heads of State or Government and in Parliamentary resolutions, that the development of the European patent system is one of the most important preconditions that will enable us to reach the goals defined by Lisbon. I was impressed by Commissioner McCreevy's emphasis on the importance of this matter. Our goal must be to achieve a simple, cost-effective patent, applicable throughout Europe if at all possible, which gives not only big business but, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to protect their innovations in the internal market: indeed, it is medium-sized enterprises that hold the greatest number of innovative patents.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive issue is that we must make changes in Europe's current fragmented patent landscape, with the aim of drastically reducing consultancy, procedural and translation costs, which are a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. That is the decisive goal that we must achieve. Of course, people can already obtain protection for their inventions throughout Europe, but, in practice, they have to do so in all Member States, either directly through the national patent offices or indirectly through the European Patent Office, with the bundle of patents that has been mentioned. In the event of disputes or infringements they must, in theory, launch proceedings, incur legal costs and so on in all these countries. This must be resolved and made more viable and practicable, particularly for SMEs. The internal market needs to be developed further in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Under your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, an admirable proposal for a single European patent regulation to establish a Community patent was set in motion. However, when Article 308 is the legal basis and unanimity in the Council is required, it is difficult to reach agreement. In this particular case, agreement could not be reached in the dispute about languages: there are currently 20 official languages that the Council is demanding; after the next enlargement there will be 22. The industry is quite rightly saying that nobody needs that sort of patent: it is so exorbitantly expensive that it is of no use and practically no economic value. The competitiveness of the European patent would push us a long way back in global terms and not guarantee the necessary quality. A patent of this kind would only be of benefit to very big, rich businesses that could afford that kind of thing, and perhaps not even to them. For medium-sized businesses it would be completely unusable. Therefore, the Regulation is stuck fast, and the Council is not shifting.</p>
<p class="contents">My suggestion of continuing with harmonisation, which you were so good as to include in the consultation, Commissioner, was also rejected by all parties, primarily following our experiences with the second reading of the Directive on computer-implemented inventions, which showed that there was a risk that legislation could be enacted that would not improve the current patent system, but would make it considerably worse.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we have made no progress with harmonisation either. What, then, is left for us to do? What is left is that we must carry on and further develop the currently existing patent system. There are, however, institutional problems in this regard: on the one hand, the European Union's fully legitimate claim that the Member States should not legislate in areas that, at any rate, actually lie partly in its sphere of competence and belong to the internal market; and, on the other hand, the Member States' keenness to make progress. I take the position that we must try to link these two problems together to solve them. In my view, one conceivable option would be for the European Union to be involved in some way – to be decided by negotiations – in the European patent agreement and, in return, for the European Union to clear up the institutional concerns regarding the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA). This could be one way in which we could improve the situation while agreement cannot be reached in the Council regarding a Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the lobby's publicly expressed criticisms, in my view, the claim that the introduction of a single European patent court within the meaning of the EPLA would make it easier to patent software is, to put it mildly, nonsense. It is pure speculation for which there is no evidence – one of those matters comes under procedural law, and one under substantive law. Nor is the EPLA more expensive. It must be clear that apples are being compared with oranges here. If the EPLA is in place, it will not be necessary to pursue legal disputes in all the countries involved: one court, the second instance, so to speak, will reach a judgment that is equally binding on all signatory States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful to Commissioner McCreevy for the way in which the consultation was conducted. I gather from the Commissioner's public comments that he, too, has obviously drawn the right conclusions from the results of the consultation. I should like to say, both personally and on behalf of the great majority of my group, that we share and support this position. There is no alternative. Otherwise, the grand project of developing the European patent system is doomed to failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to address you on behalf of three political groups and of even more than that, just as my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, also did.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this debate is due to the initiative of the European Parliament and it was born out of our desire to respond positively to your consultation. We thank you for it and we congratulate you on it.</p>
<p class="contents">After the difficulties that we encountered concerning the patentability of software, we were pleased that the Commission – with you yourself acting as intermediary - is launching a procedure aimed at restarting discussions and preparatory work on the European patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we clashed swords; we disagreed on several points. I have just listened to you extremely carefully. I can say that I agree with virtually everything you just said. I totally agree, but there is one argument that you have not mentioned, and, because of your silence, that is the one that I am led to wonder about and that, while we are still without a solution, currently leaves those that I represent in a rather negative state of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain myself a little more. All of us in this Chamber, as Europeans, want the Community patent. I have that in common with my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, who just spoke with his customary eloquence.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this patent has come up against enormous difficulties and that it is at a standstill. The main reason for this standstill is language-related. In reality, the four factors causing this standstill are the language problem, the cost problem, the problem of the legal consistency of the judicature and the sovereignty problem - the one about which you have not spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that the real means of breaking the political, cultural and intellectual deadlock at the Council regarding the European patent is mainly connected with solving the language problem. Unlike my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, I am not just a European Member who is in favour of Europe; I am also French. Nobody is perfect, you will forgive me for that. I should like to state in this House that I believe that the ratification of the London agreement – something that my country has not yet officially endorsed, although I advise it to do so – would be an opportunity for us all to overcome our linguistic arrogance and the hostility that it creates and to learn to live together, in the knowledge that one language dominates the others worldwide. We may not like it, but that is how things are; it is convenient. That is what would potentially break the deadlock on the start of plans for a Community patent. We would therefore agree to the resolution resulting from these debates saying so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is one of cost; I will hardly touch on it, except to say that three-quarters of the cost factor are language-related – that is the problem that I am going to address – and that the remaining quarter is modest, that the EPLA probably needs to be improved and that it is outrageous to think that we might see the ratification of an agreement that many experts say would increase costs. We do not need that.</p>
<p class="contents">The only problem about which you have not spoken is that of knowing which legislative sovereignty will define and develop over time the field of what is patentable and what is unpatentable.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament will be extremely sensitive to anything to do with the patentability of living matter, which is a significant problem for civilisation. Moreover, as regards software, we cannot ratify the EPLA, because the EPLA gives a professional group of judges a partly international, partly European function: that of making changes to the case law as they see fit, without any legislative control or sovereignty having a bearing on their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we do not accept: the idea that European sovereignty will play no part in defining the scope. Therefore, since the EPLA is a body of autonomous jurisdictions blocking and holding up the implementation of the European patent, we reject the EPLA and we advise you …</p>

I made my own submission and I have read many of the others and I think that what you have just given us is a very fair summary. I would also like to thank you for having moved that consultation day to a day that did not clash with a Strasbourg session, so that I and other MEPs were able to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a very useful exercise, because it has shown the extent of the problems with the Community patent proposals. Translations, as we knew, were a problem but now it shows that the need for a litigation system, with specialist judges that are accessible within Member States, is another. We all want single market considerations to prevail and that leads eventually to having a Community patent, but the consultation shows that there are steps that can be taken to improve the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The EPLA initiative by Member States, which is optional, embraces some of those steps. It is still work in progress, so now there is an opportunity for you to participate and I welcome the fact that you say you are going to take that opportunity. That can only be helpful in working towards a goal in which there is eventually a single or merged European and Community patent system. Maybe you can help to fix some of the criticisms of EPLA. One fix I would like is to minimise court fees, rather than force litigants to bear all the costs of judges’ salaries and the establishment costs of the appeal court. A second fix I would like is the retention of national patent courts, instead of phasing them out after seven years. Surely they could remain, in the same way that national patent filings have now coexisted with European patents for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the possibility of having nationally based courts of first instance and a panel of judges, with at least one who is technically qualified and at least two who are legally qualified and from different Member States, might be superior to the current ECJ arrangements, were they to apply to a Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rocard and some others have criticised EPLA, since it would allow EPO Board of Appeal members to become technical judges. That objection is based solely upon not agreeing with particular decisions in one or two areas of technology. It takes no account of the publicly available record showing that technical boards of the EPO are independent of both the EPO examining division and EPO practices. It ignores the fact that, in the EPLA structure, such technical judges would be in the minority among national judges who have been praised by those of the same persuasion as Mr Rocard for their stance in those areas of technology. However, I question whether we would want them to be able to have the two jobs at once – I do not think that was intended – and I think that could be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the appointment of judges via representatives from Member State governments follows the precedents of many institutions, including the ECJ, so I do not think there is huge substance in these arguments and it would certainly be a mistake for the Commission to miss out on contributing to and learning from the EPLA process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We always speak about a competitive, knowledge-based Europe, but some people put so little trust in Europe’s potential that they prefer to strengthen a non-EU body – the European Patent Office – to the detriment of European Union interests. If what we want is harmonised jurisdiction, why do we not pursue that aim through EU directives? That would be the most obvious way to proceed. Some people are afraid to face the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">After the software patent fight, apparently there are people who are worried about the amendments that the European Parliament would propose. Therefore they want to proceed as undemocratically as possible. They want to put the fate of Europe’s companies in the hands of the patent bureaucracy instead of elected policymakers. Furthermore, the cost of litigations would be tough to meet for SMEs because every litigation concerning an EPO patent would go directly before a new international court – a real own-goal for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to the fact that some big multinationals such as Nokia and GlaxoSmithKline are very concerned about such a proposal. If this proposal neither helps SMEs nor is welcomed by big countries, who will help? What we can infer for sure is that it will only increase the work for some patent lawyers. Europe does not need merely more patents: it needs more high-quality patents that foster real innovation. The number of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office per year has, over the last seven years, increased by about 60%. However, that number does not correspond to an increase in innovative activity, therefore giving us cause for concern over an extension of the scope of Patent Office subject matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We will keep repeating to our colleagues, and especially to the Commissioner, that only a Community framework creates the conditions for an effective, competitive European patent law at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament was also persuaded that patenting software would stifle invention, cripple small businesses and harm the economy, and yet this year the Commission returns with an even more sweeping proposal, which would permit software to be patented.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is for a single patent court, whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing – purely advisory – European Patent Office. The Commission has a seat on the Board and, under this proposal, would acquire voting rights as well. This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court, especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">By the proposal’s own admission, litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts, which this proposal will also abolish, thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations. I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal. If it goes through, I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better. Nevertheless, we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why solutions are needed which will enable the process of harmonising patent law to begin. Accordingly, a clear definition of what can and cannot be patented is required. It is important not to resort to using patent law in isolation from the innovations themselves, because by its very nature a patent implies that free competition is restricted to a certain degree. A harmonising directive would be the best solution from the point of view of the Community’s interest, but Parliament rejected the Commission’s previous proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Other solutions must therefore be sought. One idea mooted is for all Member States of the Union to accept and ratify the EPLA Convention. It should be borne in mind, however, that we can only support this Convention when it meets the criteria deemed essential by the Union. Amongst others, these criteria include drawing up a clear definition, as far as is possible, of what may be patented ensuring the independence of ruling bodies and guaranteeing the total impartiality of the judges who rule on patent protection and the validity of patents. The costs relating to the protection of patent rights must also be balanced and easy to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why we are not in a position to adopt the Convention at present. Its implications may be difficult to assess, because although it is obvious that the EPLA concerns institutional solutions, the potential impact on substantive law should not be overlooked, particularly where the practices of the European Patent Office are concerned. That is why I am asking the Commission to provide a detailed impact assessment for each of the proposals submitted here. Nonetheless, it is most important to make it clear that Parliament does want a change of patent policy. The kind of change we have in mind, however, must satisfy the needs of both large businesses and small and medium-sized European firms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must point out that we Members of the European Parliament are here representing our constituents, and the reactions I have received from constituents from the industrial sector in my country to this proposal have been negative. They are negative for various reasons: the issue of languages – I believe that the solution proposed is much worse than the one we have in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, which offers greater language plurality – and the issue of jurisdiction, which has already been discussed here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our own jurisdiction, which is that of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of First Instance, and the creation or multiplication of jurisdictions outside of the European Union raises a series of problems that we must take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">My feeling is that this proposal may be doomed to failure, like previous proposals, as a result of not taking these factors into account. We need to make progress on patents, but, in order to do so, we must have a broad political base.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would say that, at the moment, jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence − we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance − and, secondly, that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter. I know that many people have a language of a more universal nature, but within the European Union we have sought solutions to the language problem, because the European Union includes diverse cultures, diverse models and diverse legal systems, and they must be able to co-exist.</p>

We have spent more than thirty years talking about patents, and it is particularly strange that so many Members should be critical of your ideas, even though almost all the EU’s Member States are signatories to the Munich Convention. By so doing, they are implying a lack of confidence in our Member States; that I find in itself a pretty strange kind of deadlock, and I also think that there is something odd about the fact that a Community patent still cannot be discussed at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, the EU has no democratic control over the European Patent Office, and that is of course much to be regretted. We go along with your way of thinking, and it would be good if the EU were to do as it did at the Hague conference, were to take part as a political and economic organisation, so that we, as part of it, could have influence on what happens. If that happens, then intergovernmentalism is no longer the order of the day, and the community method will have been adopted. We would be happy to see the EU taking part in the Munich Convention in the same way, so that the Commission – and, perhaps, Parliament too – might be able to exercise ongoing democratic oversight over what goes on. Together, then, with the Group of the European People’s Party and with the Liberals – and I hope that the Socialist Group will join us in supporting this – we have brought in a resolution endorsing your position and with the intention of examining what options are available. We see that as the only solution if the Council is going to keep sitting on this for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking here about the rules governing languages or about the costs, and we certainly have no desire to suspend the national courts, but there must eventually be a special chamber at the European Court of Justice with specialist judges capable of determining how patents should be dealt with across Europe in the event of cases coming to trial.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the computer-implemented inventions to which Mr Rocard referred, we do not want to open that particular Pandora’s box again; I agree with him that doing that would be a very tedious business. We can also see that mistakes may well still be being made within the EPO, and, for the simple reason that we cannot correct them, it is important that we follow this up.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very struck by the words of an Irish Commissioner, who recently said, in Finland: ‘No more fine words about Lisbon; we are now going into action’. I hope that that is what you are going to do, for you, Commissioner, were the person who said that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that the situation is not perfect and we all know that there are different views as to the right solutions. I am convinced that in an ideal world the Community patent <span class="italic">is</span> the solution, but in the real world there is no prospect of agreement on the Community patent in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">So should I sit around doing nothing, just waiting for something to turn up? Well, that would certainly be an easy way out, but it would also be grossly irresponsible, because nothing will happen unless we take the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation delivered some clear and important messages. There is an overwhelming desire for a patent system that is simpler and more cost-effective and maintains the highest standards in the quality of its examination and grant procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">All the stakeholders went to great lengths to convey their views to us. Now, quite rightly, they expect action. And I agree. I believe the time has come to make a concerted push to improve the patent system in Europe. As policymakers and regulators, it is our duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we are at a standstill. We have to take the first most difficult step in one direction or another. There <span class="italic">is</span> no perfect solution. No single element will provide all the answers. We need to combine different instruments to meet the different needs of different stakeholders. As I said in my introductory remarks, the Community patent and the EPLA are not mutually exclusive initiatives; indeed, our aim should be to ensure that they converge. In both cases our goal is the same: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not blind to the potential drawbacks and dangers of the EPLA. But we have a better chance of getting the right outcome for Europe’s business if we actively engage in the negotiation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The patent strategy now contains more than just our future plans for a Community patent and EPLA. There is a whole range of framing and supporting measures that we need to consider, most of them directed at smaller companies. Our objective is to produce a system that meets the needs of all stakeholders at all levels – national, European and Community –and provides a fair balance between the diverse interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final point. As a politician for 30 years now, I am not easily surprised. But this week I have been mildly surprised. I was mildly surprised that the outline for our future strategy, which I set out in a speech in Helsinki some weeks ago, has been used by some to make assertions that the Commission wishes to bring the computer-implemented inventions question back on to the agenda. Now I am used to hearing strong arguments and to links being made, but this one leaves me quite perplexed. I have stated before this House on various occasions that as long as I am Commissioner for the Single Market and Services the Commission will <span class="italic">not</span> present <span class="italic">any</span> initiative and will not carry out any work on this. Some might like that, others might disapprove. But this Parliament rejected the common position last year. I respect and accept that decision and will do absolutely nothing to turn it around.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reassure you that I am a man of my word. When drawing conclusions from the consultation exercise, computer-implemented inventions were not in any way on my mind. That will remain so for the rest of my mandate.</p>

The draft resolution on the European Patent Litigation Agreement could, if implemented, place patent disputes in the hands of these who have a vested interest in a very wide use of patents, it would lead to extra costs for SME, cause an explosion in litigation and potentially restrict innovation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Supporters of the EPLA make reference to the USA’s central federal patent court, but this system has led to excessive use of patent, and a considerable volume of litigation and malicious threats of litigation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, we would have been finished at 5 p.m. There were important matters to discuss, such as the coup in Thailand and the situation in Moldova, but the Conference of Presidents arbitrarily decided that there would be no topical and urgent debate. I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this. We were told that this was the second sitting in September, but that is incorrect: we held the August plenary session at the beginning of September, and this is now the September plenary session, so to speak. As such, it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg. I would ask to you pass this protest on to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
