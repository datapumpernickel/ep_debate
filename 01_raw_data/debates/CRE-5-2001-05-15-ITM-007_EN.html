<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">González Álvarez (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, we are debating the revision of Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety and there is a priority which the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament share, which is to improve consumer health and safety. This has always been a desire, but in the current circumstances it has become a firmer commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is intended to guarantee the safety of marketed products and promote compliance with the obligations of producers and distributors. Producers must only market safe products, must provide consumers with reliable information, prevent risks and, where necessary, finally withdraw dangerous products already on the market. Nor must distributors supply any product which they know to be unsafe, and they must cooperate with the markets’ monitoring network, which also involves the authorities charged with monitoring product safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This revision has followed a method which we believe to be adequate, including the consultation which took place before making the proposal with non-governmental organisations and social agents, companies and so on. More than fifteen of these organisations were consulted before making the proposal and the intention was to correct the gaps and insufficiencies in the implementation of the directive over previous years. Some of these suggestions are included above all in the first Council proposal presented by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed with the majority of the proposal made to us. However, we presented thirty amendments, which we believed improved the proposal. At first reading, twenty-one of them were adopted, totally or partially. They better defined the concepts of ‘safe product’ and ‘recuperation’, pointed to the need for periodic reports to the European Parliament on the success or failure of the implementation of the directive, as well as labelling in the language of the country where the products were marketed, and proposed, amongst other things, that the candidate countries be included in the RAPEX system.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, certain issues continued to concern the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the alternative rapporteurs and the Commission itself. And in this second reading we are presenting just eleven amendments which were discussed in the Environment Committee and approved at the last sitting by a significant majority, and which at the various informal meetings – there were many and I must thank the Commission and the Council for their interest in this report – we tried to reduce.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we can easily reach an agreement on five of these amendments. They are amendments which refer to the possibility of an external certification of safe products, to the possibility of harmonising the monitoring programmes of the different Member States, to the inclusion of the precautionary principle in such an important issue and to the establishment and promotion of a network of competent authorities in relation to product safety.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more difficulties with other amendments, such as those which refer to the exporting of unsafe products to the Third World and to the safety of services. We believe it is very important that there should be specific legislation. At the moment – I do not know if this is the case in the rest of Europe, but in my country it is – services such as tourism, courses in academies or telecommunications are the subjects of much debate, because in many of them there is flagrant abuse going on. We therefore wish to ensure that there is legislation on this issue soon, as well as legislation relating to the nature of committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that it will not be difficult to reach an agreement on the eleven amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. And I will stress one which I believe should be a distinguishing mark for Europe. I am talking about our attitude to the ethics of exporting products, which Europeans consider to be unsafe, to other countries. This seems to us to be an essential amendment because, if they are unsafe for Europeans, they are unsafe for the whole world, even if other countries have more flexible regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that by supporting the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we are also supporting principles which are of paramount importance to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, it is particularly suited to achieving the internal market, free movement and the harmonisation which is required for this in an effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly appreciate the fact that the Council has adopted a large number of the amendments accepted by Parliament at first reading. The directive in its current version provides for greater transparency, more active monitoring of the markets, a better definition of producer and consumer responsibilities – for that was still a stumbling block at first reading – stricter criteria for product safety and stricter criteria for testing these products. It allows for better and more effective intervention when products need to be withdrawn from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">New, too, is rapid exchange, which I very much welcome in Europe. I would now like to turn my attention to a specific problem. It was raised in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and concerns the export ban, enshrined in Article 13. This entails an automatic export ban on products from the Community once the Commission has been requested to examine the safety of these. We do not support this. Indeed, the proposal that a request for a safety check alone should lead to an absolute and automatic ban is hardly justifiable. Needless to say, the European Union is in favour of a high level of protection and very strict safety requirements, but a distinction must be drawn between a safe and a hazardous product. My colleague, Mrs Marialiese Flemming, whom I represent here, has tabled an amendment in this connection, and she suggests only allowing the automatic export ban to apply if the product for which a ban is being issued here should also be banned on account of safety. This point is of crucial importance to the PPE-DE group, and I hope that our fellow MEPs will support us by adopting the amendment tabled by Mrs Flemming on our behalf. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the shadow rapporteur for my group, I have seen her diligence throughout these proceedings and we all wish to honour her work.</p>
<p class="contents">This is quite a new state of the parliamentary proceedings, and we need to pick our words carefully as we look forward to a potential conciliation. At second reading we are deliberately putting forward only a few amendments which centre on some very important principles, and on most of those we will reach a further agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs González Álvarez has said, the committee passed, by a substantial majority, all of the amendments, and we propose to vote for them today. We need – we think we shall get – a clear assurance that we shall move ahead from these proposals to the safety of services and the liability of service providers and there should not be any division of principle on that.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make it crystal clear that we shall also be able to take out of the market, not just for us, but world-wide, those products which present a serious risk, not just for domestic consumption, but also in the global market, because such products can easily be recycled, as Mrs González Álvarez says in her new Amendment No 13. We are asserting that principle today in the signing off of the Maaten report on tobacco, and it is precisely the same principle that we invoke here.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there will have to be some compromises and discussions, but we need to look very carefully at what the word "exemption" means, if it is going to be asserted as a limitation on the path to withdrawal. There is a will to agree and a will to compromise, but we need to do it on the basis that the precautionary principle is always held in mind in our discussions and that this is consistent with other things which this Commissioner and this Commission have done in terms of the banning of dangerous products elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that whilst I am certain that we can harmonise the guidelines on safety which will be used throughout the enlarged EU and we can agree on external certification, we need to be careful of other phrases which I hear bandied about as possible compromises. One is "where appropriate". Where is not appropriate, where we are applying the precautionary principle? It has to be there throughout, not necessarily as the <span class="italic">leitmotif</span>, but certainly as something that we bear in mind in framing the legislation. So I cannot, I fear, go along with Mrs Flemming's amendment, and I, like most of the committee, wish to press these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim is that this directive should also incorporate products which still do not come within the province of sectoral legislation and products whose safety aspects are not dealt with very well by sectoral legislation. That is important for the internal market, and it is also important for consumers to be able to rely on products within the European market displaying a high safety content. Needless to say, these consumers must then proceed to use these products in a responsible manner. This directive thus creates more clarity by explaining definitions and, at the same time, simplifying procedures so that Member States can obtain information more quickly. People still die of the effects of unsafe products. Moreover, I am of the opinion that it is irresponsible for safe product standards to be observed on behalf of EU citizens, but for citizens outside the EU to have to content themselves with less safe products. If we take these products off the shelves here, we should no longer export them. In fact, that is, of course, an issue that goes beyond this report, and I think we have not heard the last of it. This report can count on our unqualified support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council's common position improved the methods of traceability for consumer products, cooperation between authorities, producers and distributors in taking action to withdraw and recall dangerous products, and the opening up of the rapid alert system to the applicant countries. I am very pleased that it has now been made clear that charity shops, car-boot sales and flea-market stalls will not be harmed by this directive as, by their very nature, they cannot provide information on product risk and product origin for second-hand goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Environment Committee's retabled amendments, in particular the specific reference to the precautionary principle, to market monitoring and the European product safety network.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly oppose exempting provisionally banned products from the export ban. This would be double standards and would go against the very aim of the directive. If there is concern about the safety of a product, then how can we justify exporting it to third countries? As the rapporteur said earlier: safety should be assured for all consumers, not just those in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the need for a fair balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and that the measures proposed can be practically implemented – this directive can achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on general product safety is so important to us because it relates to a key area, namely those products that are not covered by the CE mark. But this brings me straight to one of the weak points of this proposal for a directive on general product safety, namely the fact that it will no longer be apparent to the consumer whether a product is really safe. This makes our Amendment No 3 especially important, because it provides quite simply for external certification by authorised testing agencies. There is an urgent need for the Commission to consider the introduction of verification marks – marks which certify to the consumer that a product is safe and, in some cases, that the product is of above-average quality.</p>
<p class="contents">A product is then deemed to be safe when its safety has been verified by an accredited test centre. This is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses. If we think about the precautionary principle and prevention, it becomes clear that incentives must be created to encourage companies to have their products tested. I believe that testing by a third party, an impartial agency, would be an important means of easing the pressure on market-monitoring programmes. And this easing of pressure, along with the predictability deriving from testing and certification, would enable consumers to establish very clearly and easily where reliably safe products can be bought.</p>
<p class="contents">On the export ban, let me say that there are naturally many countries whose standards differ greatly from those in Europe. I believe we should not be so haughty as to regard other countries’ standards as inferior and to assume that ours are the only good and valid standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, and Mr Whitehead and Mr Lange for their very comprehensive contribution to the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety. There is a formal revision provision in the original directive. The revision coincided with a reinforced commitment by the Commission to safeguard the health and safety of consumers. The revised directive will progressively lead to a substantial improvement in the possibilities for dealing with safety problems of non-food products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position takes account of the fundamental points of the amended proposal adopted by the Commission in the light of the first reading opinion. 21 out of 30 amendments from the first reading have been incorporated in part or in substance in the common position. Many of the proposed amendments of the González Álvarez recommendation are an improvement to the text and can therefore be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to address the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree. First Amendments Nos 2 and 9 reinstate the text of the Commission's original proposal for a ban on exports of dangerous products withdrawn from the EU market following an emergency decision. Amendment No 13 justifies this with the risk of reimportation to the Community market of such products which have been exported. The compromise in the common position would make it possible for the Commission to provide for exemptions from an outright ban on the export of such products. This was accepted by the Commission, because it was considered by many Member States as a safeguard necessary for them to accept the very principle of a ban; moreover the compromise leaves it up to the Commission to decide whether waiving the ban is justified. The risk of reimportation of exported goods can be kept under control with the normal mechanism of customs and market surveillance. Overall, I consider that the impact of this exemption would be very limited, would be under very tight control and supervision by the Commission itself and obviously would only operate in circumstances where it was justified, clearly rationalised and clearly acceptable and not just to me, but to the entire Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 3 introduces a requirement in an article that external certification should be regarded as a proof of conformity with the directive. The Commission can only accept a reference in a recital that such certification can facilitate proving such compliance. Thirdly, Amendment No 11 invites the Commission to submit proposals related to the safety of services before a specified date. The Commission is in fact already analysing and considering this issue as it has announced in a statement. Recital 1 would include a reference to these initiatives, as suggested by Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 12 seeks to limit the export ban so that it shall not be applied when a product has temporarily been banned from the Community market for the period needed for further safety investigations. It cannot be justified to permit exports of products banned from the Community market on the basis of a potential serious risk. In my view, this action must protect consumers outside the European Union in the same way as it protects consumers within the European Union; and it occurs to me that if an emergency measure is being taken in this way, it is highly probable that it is an emergency measure because of the nature of the danger involved and very often the most serious emergencies result from the fact that the danger is the greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the case and if my assessment is correct, it means there is a greater need for this emergency proposal to apply not only to consumers within the European Union, but also to consumers outside the European Union. Moreover, it is clear from this legislation that the evaluation as to whether it should apply in this way or not, will be undertaken by the appropriate committee which will be charged with this kind of work, experienced in doing this kind of work, which does not act precipitously or in a manner that would not fully protect the interests of consumers. The committee will only operate where there is a clear and serious danger to consumers. Having explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, I can inform you that the Commission can, in principle or in reworded versions, accept Amendments Nos 1, 4 to 8 and 10, as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to thank Mrs González Álvarez again for the excellent report which can be broadly supported by the Commission and on those amendments with which the Commission cannot agree, I am convinced that a satisfactory conclusion can be found as identified and stated by Mr Whitehead. I hope that this will be achieved as quickly as possible in the next stage of the regulatory process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
