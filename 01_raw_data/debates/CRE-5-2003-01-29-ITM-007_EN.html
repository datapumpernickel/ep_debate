<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span><span class="bold"> </span>–<span class="italic"> (NL)</span> Madam President, when we look at the European agricultural policy, two things catch our eye. Firstly, it takes up almost half the budget – that is a widely known fact. Secondly we can state fairly generally that this policy is not held in particularly high esteem in Europe. I think that something needs to be done about this. Perhaps the proposals Mr Fischler made last week can improve things. I think that we must also ensure that the agricultural accounts are above suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, agriculture is part of the European budget for which there is a special procedure for auditing the accounts – the clearance of accounts, as it is known. Every year, between EUR 600 million and EUR 800 million is claimed back from this budget of approximately EUR 45 billion. The big question is whether this is enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996 we have had a new procedure that more or less involves closing the accounts annually and taking long-term decisions on the conformity of these accounts, in other words about the question as to whether this budget has been properly executed. In 1996 a conciliation body was set up to resolve any conflicts between the Commission and the Member States, and accreditation of the paying agencies responsible for execution and payments in the Member States was introduced. That is being left to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What experience have we had since 1996? Firstly, following in the footsteps of the Court of Auditors, we can draw the general conclusion that there is a mixed system that is relatively satisfactory – but that is as far as it goes. There is clearly room for improvement. What improvements do we want to see?</p>
<p class="contents">We would like the decisions on discharge to be more clearly based on one specific financial year. At the moment these decisions still relate to different financial years, and that is ambiguous. In 1996 we also expected that everything would take place a lot more quickly, but that has clearly not been the case. With regard to the conciliation body, we had hoped that there would be fewer cases before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, but that has also not been the case. If a specific paying agency keeps making mistakes, the Commission should, in my opinion, have the opportunity to withhold payments for a couple of months until it is satisfied that the paying agency is functioning properly. The Commission might say that this does not tally with the system of proportionality and that the penalty is much too great. We are certainly not arguing for all payments of agricultural subsidies to a specific country to be suspended, however; what we are saying is that if things continuously go wrong in a certain sector, the Commission must be able to stop paying the money into the Member State’s account until the situation improves.</p>
<p class="contents">The control of agricultural subsidies is particularly important in view of the enlargement of the European Union. The system that will soon be used for making payments is the IACS system. We can see from the reports from the Court of Auditors that this system is not yet operational in any of the current Member States. We hope, as does the Commission, that it will be operational in a few months’ time. We also note that Greece still does not meet the conditions despite having been a member for so many years. It is therefore all the more urgent that the Commission propose a firm approach to this matter and thus also refuse to pay the money if these things are not put right.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that it is a shortcoming that there is still no discharge arrangement for an increasingly more important part of the European budget, namely rural development, as there is for the 1 A part of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to touch on another of this Parliament’s pet subjects: we would like to know from one year to the next which points can be said to have been improved. We are familiar with the DAS methodology and could envisage getting indicators about the size of the percentage error in the dairy sector or the tobacco sector, for example. This is something that Parliament has been wanting for some time. We would then be able to check from one year to the next how much improvement there has been. This evening the Council is conspicuous by its absence, which is highly regrettable given the importance of this subject. We would like to see the adoption of Parliament’s proposal of about a year ago, to the effect that the period of time allowed for corrections should be extended from 24 to 36 months.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion – again in the context of enlargement – we think that it is high time the Commission created ways of controlling agricultural subsidies better by paying them in advance so that we can avoid errors instead of having to correct them afterwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, auditing and the improvement of the procedure for it has always, from the very outset, been a special priority for me personally and for my staff, and it will continue to be one. That is why I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Mulder, as rapporteur, for your report, which is very precise and gives a very full picture of the auditing procedure. I also welcome the general tone of your report, in that it acknowledges the clearance procedure's success and encourages the Commission, with one eye on the imminent enlargement of the Community, to keep on constantly reviewing the system and improving it as and when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly state my views on a number of the questions raised by this report, and explain the position taken by the Commission. I would like to start by briefly considering the evaluation of the 1996 reform. Both the report and the Court of Auditors back up the Commission's view that the 1996 reform was a success. It goes without saying that I agree with you when you say that there are certain aspects which can be and should be improved, for example, the times taken by each individual stage of the procedure, which are still too long.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to make it clear that we are guided in these matters by the principle of finding a balance between the protection of the Community's financial interests and the Member States' positions as parties to the proceedings. It is, in my view, tolerable, in order to do justice to both these principles, for some stages to take rather longer, thus enabling the necessary consultations to be carried out. Despite that, I believe that success shows that we have done the right thing. In the last ten years alone, the Community has reclaimed nearly EUR 6 billion in agricultural aid from the Member States, who have, indeed paid up. These figures are eloquent and require no further elucidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, please also allow me to address two specific problems mentioned in Mr Mulder's report, on the one hand, the delays in the introduction of IACS in Greece, and on the other, the considerations linked to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully in the picture as regards the delays in Greece, and its services are closely monitoring and evaluating the progress that is being made. Strict controls have already led the Commission to demand that Greece return very substantial aid payments, and I might add that a number of proceedings are pending, which may well result in further major financial corrections by reason of the persistent weaknesses in the control system.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, though, make one thing clear. Nothing has indicated to either the European Court of Auditors or to the Commission that delays in the implementation of IACS would mean that irregularities among individual farmers in Greece were to be reckoned with. There is no reason to suppose that the financial risk to the Community is in excess of the financial adjustments already made by the Commission. The situation as regards 2002 is currently the subject of intensive examination. The Commission's decision will take into account all progress that has demonstrably been made in Greece, whilst, at the same time, the Community's financial interests must also be safeguarded in full.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn briefly to the considerations linked to enlargement. Mr Mulder requests the Commission to make every effort necessary in order to help candidate countries to comply with the deadlines imposed by law in respect of the individual control systems. At the same time, though, he insists that the candidate countries should not benefit from agricultural aid if IACS is not serviceable, or if the safeguarding of the financial interest is put at risk. On this, I cannot do other than agree with him. I, too, am firmly convinced of the rightness of the Commission's strategy for dealing with any problems that may crop up, and for doing so in the manner proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we are to help the candidate countries to be in a position to use IACS in full at the time of their accession, or to offer them the option of using the simplified system, thus making fewer demands of IACS. I think it important that I should emphasise that the use of the simplified system does not mean that these countries are exempted from the requirement to implement the IACS system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's services are currently occupied in determining the details of what these new Member States will need if they opt for the simplified IACS. There will of course be a strict timetable stipulating when the complete IACS must be available for transfer to the normal system.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I can say, in conclusion, that the audit procedure has, overall, been a success, but that new demands upon it mean that it requires constant revision and appropriate improvements where necessary. I therefore wish to ask you, honourable Members, to continue to cooperate with the Commission in making this system as good as it can be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must acknowledge that he is a person who understands the common agricultural policy in all its extremely complicated detail. Also, his comments here this evening were thoughtful and informative.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come a long way, as Mr Mulder knows, from the days when 80% of the budget of the European Union was spent on agriculture. Most of that money was spent on market support in the form of export refunds and storage, which mainly created opportunities for immense schemes of fraud and deception. We have moved a long way from that and, while Mr Casaca rightly points out the risks involved in policing export refunds, we are today spending only around four or five per cent – approximately EUR two billion – on export refunds, and we welcome that development.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the reforms already carried out and the reforms proposed by Mr Fischler will make it easier, even if we have some political difficulty with them, to police spending and ensure that the money we allocate to the common agricultural policy goes to the people who are entitled to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder makes the point in his report that the people who commit offences should have to pay for them. It should not be an indirect subsidy paid because, in cases of over-production of milk, fines are paid by the Member State rather than by the individuals who over-produced; this amounts to indirect subsidisation. We had a worse situation in the past, when mismanagement of large companies resulted in the fact that, in the clearance of accounts procedures, major corrections were being made against the Member States which were not passed on to the food processors and the people who were involved in the abuses in the first place. Again, this was unfair to the taxpayers and constituted bad administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, whilst the exercise of creating the integrated control system has been an immense project, it will prove its worth in the European Union in ensuring that the money we vote for agriculture goes to the right people and that we can account for all of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that extending that to the applicant countries seems to me, in view of the length of time we have spent getting to where we are in the present Union, to be a daunting task, but I am convinced that the Commission is working towards it. I do not expect it to run smoothly, but I think that, if we apply the lessons we have learnt, and if we insist on the proper statistics being established in the first place before the money is released, then we will achieve a successful enlargement and will be able to help the rural areas without the loss of too much taxpayers' money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, I think it would be a serious mistake to see the clearance of accounts merely as an activity whose success can be measured according to the profits made. The need to recover funds from the Member States is primarily more an indication of failure than of success, because it demonstrates the poor functioning of the systems of farm subsidies. This is frequently due to the enormous complexity of these systems and the disproportionate bureaucratic burden that they impose both on the administrations and on the farmers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must consider that the clearance of accounts in situations in which the Member State replaces food-producing or farming companies is an abusive form of State aid that distorts the rules of competition in a particularly unfair way, benefiting those who defraud the public purse and causing those who act honestly to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the forms, processes and criteria with which this clearance of accounts is undertaken do not always appear to be as balanced as they could be. We note, for example, that with regard to the mega-scandal of butter falsified by the Neapolitan camorra and marketed by various European dairy companies, the Commission gave an answer only a few days ago, to the effect that, more than two years following OLAF’s submission of its allegations, nothing has yet been done, with legal confidentiality continuing to be invoked as the reason for doing nothing. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to refer to the establishment of an incentive mechanism of 20% for Member States to recover funds from the economic actors, which appears in principle to be a good idea. I feel, however, that the way this is being carried out by the Commission is unacceptable: we are quite horrified to hear that the Commission cannot tell us how much it has spent on this incentive, it cannot tell us what Member State institutions were given these funds and whether the legal conditions necessary to recover them were properly checked. This is a situation that we find totally unacceptable and we hope that the Commission will remedy it as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This reform seeks to prevent the long delays in clearance decisions, which have been criticised frequently by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform consists of two separate procedures. The first is an annual audit on the revenue and the expenditure of a single financial year. The second is a series of multiannual compliance audits intended to verify the substance of transactions and compliance with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a conciliation procedure was introduced. Despite the difficulties entailed by this procedure, it has been shown to increase the responsibility of Member States, although it has not been as effective as was anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conciliation Body has not been sufficiently effective either. It has however contributed to the overall improvement in the clearance of accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">This report highlights how the procedure for clearance of EAGGF accounts requires further improvement. It puts forward a series of suggestions to this end. My group will therefore fully support the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am also of the opinion that it is still too early to deliver an opinion on the validity of the new system, because its complexity and the limited capacity of response of the Community’s administrative institutions make it impossible for a definitive assessment to be given. It is noteworthy, however, that the European Parliament, political body par excellence, is concerned, on its own initiative and in line with the specific rules for studying proposals, with the way in which resources common to all of Europe are allocated and with the outcome of this allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform we are now studying must be developed, to enable information facilitating multiannual comparisons to be made available to the monitoring bodies in good time. This responsibility falls to the Commission, something that the rapporteur, Mr Jan Mulder, does well to point out, setting this in appropriate terms. I also share the concern and the recommendations of the rapporteur when he examines the strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation mechanisms, the implementation of financial corrections, the control of expenditure allocated to rural development and the new problems that will inevitably arise with the functioning of the Union under enlargement to twenty- five countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that the policy’s primary focus must always be the allocation of financial resources, especially when dealing with less highly-developed countries. It is crucial that the management systems of the applicant countries are defined and integrated, promoting and developing both the delegation of powers to the Sapard agencies, and shortening the chain for implementing aid instruments. We cannot overlook the fact that the CAP is currently a potential source of equality and absorbs 47% of the Community budget, which requires the use of specific auditing and regulatory procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that, regardless of the current quantitative results of the conciliation process, this process must continue to be used and extended, because it is precisely by implementing it that all the advantages and disadvantages of a political consideration and decision on the implementation of Community funds can be exploited and validated, reserving for the judicial system the exclusive right to act on the fraudulent use of funds made available to Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I already said within the Committee on Budgetary Control, I can but support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, it consists of two clearly differentiated parts and has two distinct aims. Firstly, there is a critical and rigorous assessment of the reform. Constructive criticism is applied to the deficiencies of the latter. These include the division of the clearance procedure, the structure and activities of the Conciliation Body and the financial corrections applied. The shortcomings are detailed in a constructive manner however, and solutions are proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rapporteur expresses rational and legitimate concern about the immediate impact of enlargement, which is nearly upon us. This concern relates especially to the consolidation of the Integrated Administration and Control System in all Member States. Everything should also be in place for this system to be implemented in the candidate countries as soon as enlargement takes place. The lessons learnt about the SAPARD programme are also cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning. We should heed it. I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the flexibility he displayed during the proceedings in the Committee on Budgetary Control. His approach ensured that the report was adopted unopposed. This represents a considerable achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that of recovery. Here we see the sum of some EUR 3 billion mounting up, and the amount of money outstanding keeps increasing. The recovery rate for 2000-2001 has been halved, down to some EUR 40 million. Something is wrong here. It is not working. This is not right. I believe I am right in saying that our recovery rate has not even reached 16 %.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, Commissioner, has to do with the implementation of IACS in Greece and, in future, in the candidate countries. This is a highly political question and not just one of whether or not maladministration has been brought to light there. How are we to get the new Member States, soon to be joining us, to believe that they have to introduce an IACS system, if there are old Member States that have simply failed for years on end to implement one? Politically speaking, that is just not on. At some point they will say to you, ‘Come back in ten years, Mr Fischler. We will have introduced it by the time the Greeks do.’</p>
<p class="contents">And that, of course, as far as budgetary exactitude is concerned, is where we end up on very treacherous ice. That is why it is important that we bring pressure to bear on the last Member State of the present Union, telling them that they must introduce this system, or else things will go wrong in connection with enlargement. We know, for example, that in Poland, a major case of fraud has come to light in the run-up to the introduction of IACS, but I mention that only in passing. Let me repeat: this is a highly political question, and one that cannot be reduced simply to maladministration. Commissioner, it is one that we have to get to grips with together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
