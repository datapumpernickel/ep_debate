<p class="contents">Subject: Humanitarian crisis in Angola</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The protracted war in Angola has brought about a severe crisis and a calamitous economic and social situation. Thousands of people, children included, are dying of hunger. The Luanda Government has been appealing again and again for emergency aid. Given the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Angola, international aid, not least from the European Union, has to be stepped up immediately. Is the Commission monitoring developments as regards hunger in Angola, which, according to the most recent figures, is now besetting four million people? What steps is it taking to minimise the immense human suffering? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission is committed to addressing the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola effectively and without delay and to supporting the peace process. The Commission is constantly monitoring the situation in Angola, as we have done for many years, in order to get a clear picture of humanitarian needs. I will be going to Angola – and also to Zambia – to assess the situation myself later this month, so I shall gain an overview of the humanitarian situation and the development of the peace process in Angola. On that occasion I will be signing the EC-Angola cooperation strategy for 2002-2007, including the plan of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's action in Angola is twofold: emergency humanitarian aid and a longer-term strategy based on cooperation. This is funded by ECHO and by EDF funds. As far as the humanitarian aid is concerned, the Commission, through ECHO, has already generated a considerable amount of funding to address the needs and will maintain its presence and commitment in the country throughout this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year Angola was among the top ten recipients of ECHO funding, receiving a total of EUR 14 million. This year, an initial decision has been taken to provide EUR 8 million funding, due to be adopted soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Malnutrition is one of the main targets for our support in the humanitarian area, particularly in forgotten regions where no other donors are present in the country. As far as the longer-term strategy is concerned, in May 2002, a month after the signature of the peace agreement, a plan of action to support the peace process was presented by the Commission and approved by the General Affairs Council on 13 May. The plan of action identified a financial package, originally EUR 124 million, from unspent EDF funds and budget lines aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns at this stage, including emergency relief, food aid and food security, reintegration and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons and de-mining operations. The implementation of this is now under way and to our great satisfaction we can start doing things in a country where for many years we have, owing to the circumstances, only been able to do humanitarian work.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, and as part of this plan of action, the Commission has made EUR 30 million available for emergency support for the peace process by reallocating funds from earlier European Development Funds to support short-term work on the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">These funds are targeted at medical assistance, the distribution of seeds and tools, food aid and the resettlement of former UNITA soldiers and their families. De-mining is also important. We tried to do all this as quickly as possible last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on all this will be implemented through different UN agencies, EuronAid and FAO for the food security component and different NGOs for the de-mining operations. Proposals for EUR 16 million have been signed and the remaining proposals are awaiting approval by the Angolan national authorities. They are expected to be finalised within the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Although humanitarian support will continue to be provided, the Commission considers that pressure must be kept up on the Angolan Government to urge it to assume more direct responsibility for its own vulnerable populations. We are therefore calling upon the government of Angola to make more efforts in addressing the critical humanitarian needs of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Angolan Government’s intention to organise an international conference for the reconstruction of the country, and trust that the views of all groups in society will be reflected in the reconstruction plan to be presented. The Commission has offered to assist in the organisation of the conference, which is tentatively scheduled to take place in March or April 2003 in Brussels, kindly hosted by the Belgian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">These are times of great change and challenge for Angola after many years of conflict. The emphasis now will be on progress, economic growth, stability and governance. That will change the whole mood of politics in the country and I am looking forward to the dialogue we shall be participating in next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased with the action taken by the Commission and by the European Union in Angola, and I note that the Commission is stepping up the action it is taking to assist development in and provide humanitarian aid to Angola. I totally agree that the best solution for Angola is to take advantage of this country's enormous potential. Angola has been generously endowed with resources by nature, but unfortunately it has also been the victim of acts of madness by mankind for decade upon decade. It is now possible to use these rich and immense natural resources to benefit the people of this country, which, although it covers an enormous geographical area, has a population of just 13 or 14 million people. So we are faced with a difficult paradox: a land rich in resources with a population living on the verge of misery, hunger and death.</p>

Only a matter of a few decades ago, Angola was one of Africa's principal agricultural exporters, and this of course means that it is appalling that we now have to supply it with food aid – a situation brought about by both war and socialist mismanagement of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three questions I would like to put to you. Firstly, what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing? That, in my view, is the most important thing, that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce. Secondly, what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food? And thirdly, what is happening about educational and training programmes? These are, I believe, the three most important issues that are at stake here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In cases like this almost everything is important. I would say to Mr Posselt that consolidating peace, to give people the confidence that it is irreversible, is most important right now. But certainly it is essential to open up the interior of the country and make roads safe from landmines so that economic life and the resettlement of people can take place. This is extremely high on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years any support, even food supplies and basic commodities, has had to be flown in to the small towns in most of the country: these towns were more or less isolated because of UNITA which surrounded them. For humanitarian reasons, for political reasons and for economic reasons, opening up and creating a normal flow is absolutely essential. There is an increasing number of accidents due to landmines because things are starting to move now. It is therefore enormously urgent to accelerate that effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards agriculture, as defined in the country strategy paper, we will be focusing on agricultural development. This is essential both for the survival of the people and because of the enormous potential that Mr Posselt rightly pointed to. Angola is more than diamonds and oil. It is also a country that has great potential for a much more diversified economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Recent maritime disasters</span></p>
<p class="contents">In light of the series of maritime disasters that have occurred in European waters in November and December 2002, namely the Prestige disaster which continues to produce yet more oil slicks which are devastating the coastline and marine life of Galicia, compounded with the recent collision between the freighter the Tricolor and the Kariba, and the second collision between the wreck of the Tricolor and the freighter the Nicola, will the Commission recognise that there is a clear need for a coordinated EU response? Furthermore, given the severe consequences of such maritime accidents, what is the Commission's view of the submission that I made to the Convention on the Future of Europe in June 2002 (reference Conv 150/02), calling for the creation of an EU Coastguard? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document contains detailed proposals for a series of measures and, in particular, speeds up the application of the legislation approved by Parliament and the Council following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, the so-called <span class="italic">Erika I </span>and<span class="italic"> II</span> packages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Transport Council of 6 December supported the majority of the initiatives proposed by the Commission. Therefore, on 20 December, the College approved a proposal for a regulation, which has just been sent to the Council and to Parliament, prohibiting the transport of heavy oils by single-hull oil tankers destined for or originating from European Union ports and speeding up the replacement of this type of oil tanker by double-hull oil tankers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has not waited for the recent events to happen to implement an agreed maritime safety policy. There was already a wide range of measures for guaranteeing better protection in this field. The Commission takes good note of Parliament’s contribution to the work of the Convention with regard to the creation of a European coastguard body as an effective means of fighting the danger of pollution and maintaining maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The recurrence of accidents such as the <span class="italic">Erika</span> or the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, not to mention other lesser ones such as the <span class="italic">Vicky</span> just a few days ago, demonstrates that the whole of Europe would gain from a European coastguard body, particularly in view of the fact that some of the 25 future States of the Union have absolutely no type of protection or body of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the main task of the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is soon to be created, is to technically coordinate the application of Community rules, and the Commission will study which measures must be adopted in the future, in view of the experiences of the Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster highlights not only the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation which you referred to in your answer, designed to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, but also the lack of an adequate EU response mechanism. In relation to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, responsibility and liability were disputed. This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact. If this incident, with the consequences it had for the shared environment and European fishing industries, had occurred in EU waters, and if an EU coastguard had existed, the response time would have been reduced, a refuge port would have been designated and the damage could have been minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, we have had the subsequent incidents involving the <span class="italic">Tricolor</span>, the <span class="italic">Kariba</span> and the <span class="italic">Nicola</span>. All these indicate the need not just for legislation but for the resources to do the job. Would the Commission consider setting up a study? We can learn how the United States tackles this problem, in relation not only to prevention – it saves some USD 6 billion per year by preventing incidents like this – but to its response when incidents do happen. They have successful experience in this field, and we have a lot to learn from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission is the body which initiates legislation, I urge you, Commissioner, to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what I said very clearly when I made the proposals in the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council had agreed to the proposal for single-hull vessels transporting oil to leave Community waters, the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>disaster would not have taken place, because it would have had to leave Community waters several months beforehand. I do fully agree that there are things we can learn from the United States. I do not understand why the United States can have a timetable according to which there will be no single-hull vessels transporting oil in its ports by 2010 and we cannot adopt a similar measure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, as the honourable Members know, a less ambitious timetable was approved. What I have proposed to this Parliament and to the Council of Ministers is that we return to the Commission’s initial proposal and speed up the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil. And furthermore, to take the maximum security measures, specifically, that the transport of heavy oil, of heavy fuel oil, of bituminous products and of tars, in other words, of the most polluting products, should be carried out by safer ships, meaning those with double hulls.</p>
<p class="contents">Copenhagen speaks of specific measures. The Commission is studying how to apply those specific measures following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>; they include the possibility of promoting the construction and maintenance of two or three large skimmers, large suction machines, so that, if an oil slick happens – unfortunately there is no such thing as zero risk, although it should be reduced to the minimum – there may be vessels of the greatest possible power, superior to the vessels currently in existence on European coasts, which furthermore can operate and act at sea at times of storms and difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We must coordinate the European response. The Agency, which would be responsible for these vessels and for the deployment at different strategic points on European coasts, must also implement a series of plans for responding to maritime accidents of this type. This will be one of your tasks: to create a pre-established method for cooperation between different Member States of the Union, which could work better, since it largely depends on bilateral agreements rather than on a perfectly coordinated European-type action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to responsibility, as the honourable Member knows, we are working on it and I hope that over the next few weeks we can present, within the Commission and rapidly approved, a proposal to provide a criminal definition of serious negligence in all the Member States of the Union in the event of this type of accident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do indeed have the document of 3 December, which I read with great interest. However, as I see it, the Transport and Environment Councils held in the same month and the Copenhagen European Council did not respond in any practical way to the Commission's request for urgent action.</p>
<p class="contents">You called for the commitments given in the ‘Erika’ legislation to be implemented, Mrs de Palacio, and you called for an approach that went beyond those commitments, but the European Council turned its back on the victims of the disaster who at that very moment were scooping up oil with their own hands. The Council seemed to hold the Commission's views in contempt, and it is enough to say that it proposed only five million euros for Galicia and all the countries affected, whereas the United States is currently calling for four billion euros for the ‘Exxon Valdez’ accident.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, Commissioner, I would like to ask you why the Commission has not brought forward a legislative act like the United States' Oil Pollution Act, which provides a real basis for combating this problem. Furthermore, will Galicia be considered as a location for a European Maritime Safety Agency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the Transport Council on 6 December, conclusions were unanimously approved which stated that the States are committed at national level, until we have a Community proposal, to adopting measures aimed at excluding from their ports any ships transporting bituminous products (heavy fuel oil, heavy oil, tars) which do not have a double hull. And the country which I know best, just like the honourable Member, has already taken a measure which entered into force on 1 January this year, and certain other countries have adopted it as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as well as this proposal, they have committed themselves to adopting, before June, an accelerated timetable for the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil from European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, they have committed themselves to speeding up the implementation of all the measures adopted in the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages and therefore not to wait until July of this year or February 2004 to do so. In particular, I am awaiting a response to the delicate issue of the famous ports of refuge; in principle, the Member States of the Union have the time limit of February 2004, but I hope they will communicate it to us before that – some countries are beginning to work on this – and I hope that they will do so before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore insist that I believe there is considerable agreement. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> tragedy has been a real wake-up call for all the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to have the powers of the federal government of the United States, but the European Union is not a federation and the Commission is not therefore the federal government of a United States of Europe; I would not mind if it were, and if I were a Minister in that federal government, but that is not the case. Despite this, we have proposed a series of measures which are very similar to the American proposal, except on the timetable – which, I insist, we are going to raise again so that it may be speeded up – and on the amount of compensation, which is on the table with the Ministers and must be discussed, and if it is not adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the Ministers have committed themselves to proposing it at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to the honourable Member that I have nothing against the Maritime Safety Agency, but rather I am entirely in favour of it, but it is not I who decides. This will be decided by the European Council at the appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are also well aware of the problem associated with maritime traffic. I believe we must do work on this; in relation to the problem of the Channel, we have seen that there are aspects on which progress can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to flags of convenience, the honourable Members are aware that, within the International Maritime Organisation, work is being done to improve this situation. In any event, there are two types of flag of convenience: those which exist for purely economic or tax reasons and those which, furthermore, demonstrate very little responsibility when it comes to control and the quality of the ships which fly them. We must distinguish between these two situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to act is not to make a generic declaration; which would be the easiest thing to do, but, when it comes down to it, would be difficult to put into practice. We have to make their lives difficult in our ports so that they stop coming. In this regard, port inspections, with the selective criteria we have proposed and which have been approved thanks to the support of this Parliament, and which the Council also approved, clearly mean that, as soon as a ship flying that flag reaches a European Union port, it will be thoroughly inspected. It will therefore have to be up to scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of action and control, particularly in relation to those countries and flags which present most risk, is the way to act in the immediate term. However, the honourable Member is right, because it is not just a question of flags of convenience, but also the problem of the responsibility of classification societies, who have a conflict of interests, because they justify and certify the quality of a ship on behalf of the State issuing the flag but at the same time work for the owner of the ship in order to issue certain types of certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">We must analyse these chains and deal with the issues in depth, and we must also deal with responsibility in the event of serious negligence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Respect for these principles by the States is guaranteed by the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the European Community Treaty and by the political procedures laid down in Article 7 of the Union Treaty. In accordance with the former, the Commission can bring a case before the Court of Justice if the alleged act falls within the scope of Community law. In the case of the latter, the Commission or a third of the Member States of the Union can raise the issue before the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government, in the event of a serious or persistent violation of the principles laid down in Article 6.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of cases relating to the issues raised by the honourable Member relate to asylum, immigration and the protection of the rights of third-country nationals. These issues are included in the scope of the Community’s competences. Furthermore, the Community began to legislate on this issue in accordance with Articles 61 and 63 of the European Community Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would point out however that the report by the Council of Europe which the honourable Member refers to was followed by a detailed response by the Greek authorities, which in the current situation is providing a series of responses to the concerns expressed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. In any event, the Commission will closely monitor the development of the dialogue between the Council of Europe and the Greek authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to put the following supplementary question to you: quite apart from anything else, when it comes in these cases to the right to visit foreign nationals, especially immigrants, wherever they are being held, and it is often in unofficial detention centres, can we guarantee or can we call on or persuade the Greek authorities to make visiting rights normal practice, at least for non-governmental organisations? Then at least we could resolve the problems which have already been raised as a result of these accusations, accusations which make me personally cringe with shame, both on my own account and as a Greek citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Formal adoption is yet to take place because of the parliamentary reservations of one State of the Union. However, this directive – which was also supported by the Greek Government – intends to grant asylum seekers material facilities, which include accommodation, food and clothing, as well as a daily allowance which guarantees an adequate standard of living and subsistence for the asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">The States will also have to inform asylum seekers of the advantages they may benefit from, give them access to the labour market in certain circumstances, and ensure that they receive the necessary medical care. Furthermore, they will ensure that the conditions for reception are subject to appropriate monitoring and control. Finally, they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers, at borders and in residential centres. All these measures will be applied in favour of asylum seekers authorised to remain in the territory in that capacity, even if they are obliged to remain in a particular place.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Greece has accepted this agreement and – although the Commission will monitor this issue – we know that the dialogue between the Greek authorities and the European Council about these complaints that the honourable Member has mentioned is continuing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a subject which I know he is very capable to deal with, since I have participated in a number of seminars organised by his services.</p>
<p class="contents">When I arrived in Strasbourg this week, I discovered that this question was not down for a reply by Mr Liikanen, and Parliament's services told me that it had been reclassified by the Commission – I understand, by President Prodi's services – as a general question, and that therefore it would not be covered. I have two points to make to the President.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I have discussed this with Mr. Liikanen and, if we have time to reach it this afternoon, he is certainly prepared to address the subject, if not necessarily the full scope of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">The broader issue is, could we ask the Parliament's services – and I am not blaming them in any way because this is a Commission issue – to ensure that if a Member's question is reclassified in this way, and is not down for an answer by the Commissioner to whom it is redirected, we are told about that, so that it can be reformulated if necessary and the Commissioner to whom it is addressed can answer it.</p>
<p class="contents">It does seem to me, Mr President, from the point of view of this Parliament, that it is perfectly possible for the Commission services in effect to deflect a question away from a Commissioner unilaterally, without the Member concerned having any knowledge of it. Perhaps you could address that, and take it up with the services, so that in future we may be given more knowledge about these instances. Can I ask you, if we have time, to allow Mr Liikanen to answer my question? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the classification today, as you have explained quite rightly, this question is not allocated to Mr Liikanen.</p>

<p class="contents">In other words, introducing one question means giving up another, and this sets a very difficult precedent. You, as a Briton, know better than anybody else how important precedents are.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, your question will be replied to in writing. It will only be possible if some of the twenty minutes remains and Mr Liikanen is prepared to answer it. Only in this case.</p>

This is a policy line that we have followed for many years. The European Charter for Small Enterprises has been a valuable instrument focusing and reinforcing this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the Charter recommendations address issues that fall under national responsibility. Much of the Commission's work aims to help Member States to improve the business environment for their small businesses. The Commission welcomes the request of the Barcelona European Council that Member States speed up the Charter implementation. This has contributed to keeping small businesses' concerns high on the political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a chance to speak with the Greek Presidency last week and my services have separately met the national authorities of all Member States including the Greek Ministry of Development to review progress under the Charter. The Commission will report next week on the implementation of the Charter but I can already now say that Member States’ progress in 2002 is encouraging, in particular in the areas of education for entrepreneurship and better regulation. Better regulation is at the heart of the Commission's concerns at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may just refer to the question by Mr Harbour, better regulation involves, at the Commission level, firstly open consultation so that SMEs are not taken by surprise when new legislation is being proposed, and secondly impact assessment where we try in a consolidated manner to assess the impact on businesses, especially of course small- and medium-sized businesses, of any important new regulatory initiative that the Commission takes.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we have agreed orally on the number of the issues which will go to this kind of broad impact assessment when we assess the economic, social and environmental impact. A detailed review of all Community measures benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises will also be published next week when the Commission reports comprehensively on entrepreneurial and SME activities. At the same time I hope we will be also able to adopt in the Commission the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">This Green Paper intends to launch a debate among the widest possible audience of stakeholders on two crucial issues:</p>
<p class="contents">how to produce more entrepreneurs,</p>
<p class="contents">and</p>
<p class="contents">how to get more firms to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper defines entrepreneurship as a ‘mindset’ and focuses on the role of policy on entrepreneurial behaviour among both new and existing entrepreneurs. It also considers the influence of society at large on entrepreneurial initiative and risk-taking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Paper suggests a coordinated approach, involving policy-makers in different services at European, national and regional level, to provide a coherent response to the needs of entrepreneurs. The Commission can help the Member States to share experience and compare performance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Paper identifies three pillars for action:</p>
<p class="contents">firstly, bringing down barriers to business development and growth;</p>
<p class="contents">secondly, balancing the risks and reward of entrepreneurship;</p>
<p class="contents">and thirdly, a society that values entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">For each of these, the Green Paper raises a number of questions for debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the SMEs which have benefited from Community funding are concerned, some basic data have been collected but a completed picture would require more time for an in-depth analysis.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Status of third-party certifiers in the EU</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is currently working on a new approach to the CE marking system and the future strategy for that system. From the point of view of European SMUs, it is particularly important that European third-party certifiers should continue to be able to place their own marks on all products. Particularly in the light of global competition, and in the interests of consumer protection, those marks should be easily recognisable by every member of the public, given that non-European certifiers can at any time check a product and, as third-party certifiers, have their own names and logos placed on that product.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the European Commission intend to incorporate these considerations regarding the strengthening of the position of European certification undertakings into its new approach to the CE marking system? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">CE conformity is one of the main points that have been identified as requiring strengthening. This marking, required by most new approach directives, is addressed to market surveillance authorities of the Member States and symbolises the conformity of the product with the applicable Community requirements imposed on the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication will also address the issue of the relationship between the CE marking and voluntary markings. The Commission has conducted an on-line survey of new approach stakeholders. As far as the CE marking was concerned, the Commission has taken on board the opinions of the majority of those who replied, the main thinking being that the additional voluntary markings are not in contradiction with the CE marking, as long as they do not cause confusion or overlap in meaning or purpose with it. They also often provide added value for consumers, users, public authorities and all those being addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Third party certifiers are in some sectors already involved in the conformity assessment procedures leading to the CE marking. It is also quite often stipulated that the identification number of the item should appear next to the CE marking. Third party certification, in areas of conformity assessment where no harmonised directives apply, is permitted and even welcomed, since it indicates to the people to whom it is addressed that certain qualities of the product have been tested and certified by the body in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The CE conformity marking does indeed confirm that the product complies with all rules within the European Union and is legal here. The only thing is that the public do not, in fact, want just this legal status quo; they want certification by a third – and of course neutral – party to give better products a higher market profile, so that what we end up with, for all practical purposes, is a quality pyramid. The CE marking would be its lowest level, with a standard mark being required to indicate significant improvements in quality, practical usefulness, or safety features in comparison with the normal CE marking.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: CFSP: Future prospects for Kosova</span></p>
<p class="contents">Recent contacts with political leaders in Kosova have made it clear to me that the young Kosovan institutions face enormous handicaps in seeking to pursue a real and effective policy, not least on the socio-economic front. I can dispense with a description of the dire economic situation in Kosova, well known as it is. Kosova needs urgently to be enabled to pursue an imaginative policy in order to attract investment. The big problem is that the Kosovan authorities are prevented by the statute in force from pursuing any such policy. Kosova is, in particular, not at present in a position to conclude any international trade agreements or to contract loans with international financial institutions. Kosova needs a clearly autonomous statute. I therefore ask the Commission what future prospects it can hold out to the Kosovars of that happening. Specifically, can Kosovan institutions count on very wide-ranging autonomy in the future? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kosovo's current economic situation is clearly a product of past political and economic neglect and oppression before 1999. This demanded major economic efforts from the United Nations interim administration, and especially its European Union pillar, in the last three years. A war-torn region has been economically stabilised, basic infrastructure has been repaired, the euro has been introduced and the legal framework for a market economy is being laid. A new customs service is collecting much-needed revenues for the Kosovo budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still heavily engaged on the ground to further support Kosovo's recovery, for instance, the consolidation of the rule of law, which is vital to attract foreign direct investment. There is still a long way to go but we should not forget from which level we started.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has succeeded in letting Kosovo benefit from the various instruments of the European Union's stabilisation and association process, even without a decision on its future status, to ensure that it does not fall behind in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">UNMIK is also currently consulting with various international financial organisations on how to give Kosovo access to their funds in the absence of a decision on its final status.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the stability pact, UNMIK is exploring ways of embedding Kosovo in the process of regional trade liberalisation and has already signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the regional electricity market in south-east Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we have gone a very long way to find creative ways to improve Kosovo's economic situation and we will continue to do so. Our efforts and those of the United Nations qualify the imaginative policy that the honourable Member mentioned in his question, even though Kosovo's unresolved status poses additional challenges to both the international and local authorities. This should not prevent us from pursuing a sound economic policy and structural reforms, which are feasible and necessary to ensure economic growth and welfare for the people of Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Commissioner Patten wholeheartedly for his answer. It was a very elaborate answer which took account of reality. My question was actually prompted by talks with representatives of the Kosovar community, representatives of both Mr Haradinaj’s party and the LDK of Ibrahim Rugova, both of whom point out whenever we meet them that Kosovo has no status as yet, which makes their work much more difficult. They are asking us to make serious efforts to enable them to contact international financial institutions despite their current status. We know that much has happened. The war took place almost three and a half years ago. Is it not possible for us, the European Union, which has the necessary leverage in the international institutions, to make efforts to help Kosovo gain access to institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the United Nations?

<p class="contents">I have two points. First of all I very much agree with the argument of the head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Mr Steiner, that the real task for Kosovo over the coming year is to put standards before status. What we want to see is Kosovo putting in place the sort of policies and the sort of implementing agencies which will allow it, with the other countries in the region, to move ever closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the honourable Member is correct in saying that a problem that we face in Kosovo is that as it becomes more economically self-sustaining, as it moves away from heavy dependency on grants, it will naturally be looking to international financial institutions and others for loans. The status issue has raised some problems in that respect. We are discussing that issue with the IFIs, in particular with the European Investment Bank, and I very much hope that we will be able to resolve it in a way which enables Kosovo, as one would expect of any economy in those circumstances, to move from grant-dependency to the ability to borrow money and to service those loans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country, they will carry on trying to emigrate, rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence this question: is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo, in which these issues are at least considered? After all, the present position cannot remain as it is for decades at a stretch, and we cannot go sliding, without any sort of forward planning, into a future that will be with us very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, as I said earlier, I support the arguments which have been put forward by the special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Steiner, that the task at this stage for Kosovo is to focus on standards rather than to consume the political process with debates about status. Clearly we have discussed those political issues with Kosovar representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that in the three years and more that I have been visiting Kosovo we have seen not only a transformation of the economic and social situation on the ground but the establishment of the provisional administration: the political structure to reflect the wishes of the people of Kosovo themselves.

The list of destroyed projects has recently been updated by the Commission office in Jerusalem, in coordination with the EU Member State representative offices in Jerusalem and Ramallah. The estimated total, as of 14 December last year, stands at approximately EUR 24 million. This assessment is limited to the costs of physical infrastructure, excluding indirect losses such as project delays or suspensions.</p>
<p class="contents">These estimated damages were presented to the General Affairs Council of 28 January last year; the GAC in turn asked the Government of Israel to put an end to this practice and reserved the right to claim reparation in the appropriate fora. The issue was also more recently discussed at the EU-Israel Association Council meeting of 21 October 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the European Union in the international community is that the wanton destruction of basic infrastructure and facilities is counter-productive. It sets back efforts to improve the economic, social and humanitarian development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Poverty levels are now at over 60% and unemployment is at around 50%. This situation of economic collapse, and a deepening humanitarian crisis, destroys hope and destroys any prospect of stability and security for both Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel, due to its relatively high average income per inhabitant, is not eligible to benefit from bilateral European Union funding under MEDA programmes. So the Israeli Government or Israeli public entities do not receive funding from the European Union aid budget. Some organisations from civil society in Israel and the Palestinian territories may apply for projects designed to support the peace process. These projects should, in our view, be pursued in any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Some organisations have advocated – and this has been debated in Parliament – commercial sanctions against Israel. I am bound to say that in my strong judgment the suspension of the association agreement, which provides the basis not only for the European Union's trade relations with Israel but also for its political dialogue, would do nothing at all to increase the understanding of the Israeli authorities in relation to the current widely held concerns of the European Union and of many European Union citizens.</p>

<p class="contents">In answer to the only supplementary question, I should like to be told whether the military action currently being taken by Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank affects the EU’s policy of aid to the Palestinian people.

<p class="contents">Firstly, all of us condemn terrorist acts. All of us condemn suicide bombing. Many of us doubt whether the right way of rooting out the infrastructure of terrorism in the Palestinian territories is by destroying the infrastructure of public facilities and the Palestinian authority. I am not sure what damaging and almost destroying the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territories has to do with rooting out terrorism. I am not sure what destroying the Land Registry has to do with rooting out terrorism. Very often it looks to bystanders as though every manifestation of institutional life in the Palestinian territories has been targeted, whether public or private, whether the authorities' administrative structure or civil society. I happen to believe that is a profoundly mistaken policy, particularly if one is trying to hold out to Palestinians a political prospect and a path to peace and future security.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the question of our assistance in Palestine, we continue to provide to the Palestinian authority – and this is a policy that began because of the block put on the payment of tax revenues by Israel to the Palestinian authority – very carefully controlled and monitored assistance, for instance to pay for doctors and nurses and for the ordinary infrastructure. We have been one of the main supporters of the Palestinian authority and have been the subject of some very unfair criticism for that. However, keeping a Palestinian authority in being is an important part of holding out the prospect of a peace process. We continue to provide substantial quantities of other sorts of assistance, such as humanitarian assistance. Before Christmas we announced that we would provide EUR 30 million for those municipalities in Palestine that had been hardest hit by hostilities. We are providing a loan fund of EUR 10 million for small- and medium-sized enterprises. I can send details of all the assistance that we have given in the Palestinian authorities. I am only sorry that it has not been more successful in creating the economic and social foundations that are so relevant to a peaceful political future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This may be true in some circumstances, but what has seemed surprising to us is the way in which one Palestinian institution after another has been destroyed or badly damaged as though some people believe that the aim of the exercise should be to undermine the ability of Palestinians to actually create an administrative structure for a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take two examples that I referred to earlier. How can destruction of the Land Registry contribute to the defeat of terrorism? How can doing a huge amount of damage to the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territory be other than an example of needless destruction? It is not very sensible when most of the material contained in the Central Bureau of Statistics can be found freely on the internet. It is difficult to see how those activities can be justified. This is a point I have made before; it is a point that the Council of Ministers has also made, and it is a point which the Israeli authorities should address rather more intelligently and sympathetically than they have so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Voice of Europe</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its answer to Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0234_EN.html">H-0234/02</a><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the financing of a ‘Voice of Europe’ radio station, the Commission claims that, with regard to Parliament’s budgetary comments, some proposed activities greatly exceed the budgetary resources available and the establishment of a ‘Voice of Europe’ radio station falls into this category. It points out, by way of comparison, that Voice of America had a budget of more than USD 131 million in 2001, whilst the annual budget of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights comes to some one hundred million euros. The Commission states that the inclusion of this priority would throw into question adherence to the guidelines set out in its Communication and the implementation of the priorities in the 2002-2004 programming document for Chapter B7-7.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission make reference to VOA and not to Radio Free Asia, which is funded by the US Congress, or to Voice of Tibet? RFA broadcasts in Mandarin, Tibetan, Cantonese, Uyghur, Burmese, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer and Korean and runs on a budget that is significantly lower than that of VOA: USD 30 million (financial year 2002) as opposed to USD 131 million.

<p class="contents">Our differences are on two points: firstly the eligibility of this specific proposal in terms of the current funding policies and criteria, and secondly the cost of the proposal both in investment and running costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Projects of this nature are foreseen neither in the communication of May 2001 on the European Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, nor in the 2002-2004 programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. The programming document which governs the selection of projects sets out eligible themes for support, including freedom of expression for the independent media, which were then refined in the context of programming identification missions to 29 focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. These refined themes, which effectively excluded the possibility of a project with a regional character, formed the basis of an international call for proposals launched in July 2002 with a deadline of 5 November.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless likely that, with future calls proposals, the criteria concerning the selection of projects under the general theme of strengthening democratisation, good governance and the rule of law will be modified to allow projects of a regional nature. In this context it would be possible for an applicant to present a project concerning a ‘Voice of Europe’. However, this brings me to the problem of cost. Any application would be admitted only provided it satisfied the general conditions of eligibility applicable under the published guidelines, including the condition that the grant is to fund specific project activities rather than general operating costs. Whichever comparison is drawn, the cost of establishing a radio station would be high and it would probably require permanent annual core funding for which this budget line is an inappropriate instrument. Achieving the same objectives by the use of the Internet might be a more appropriate way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You did not respond specifically to the question of the difference in figures between the cost of an initiative such as Voice of America, which costs USD 130 million, and that of another extremely effective radio station, Radio Free Asia, which is recognised as such by numerous inhabitants of Asia, and which only costs USD 30 million annually. Thirty million is starting to look more feasible in relation to the 100 million that make up the annual budget devoted to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, however, is, more specifically, the following: if Parliament were to vote for a significant increase in the ‘human rights’ budget heading, would you be inclined to move on to an operational phase of the ‘Voice of Europe’ project? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am absolutely convinced that providing reliable information about world affairs in countries that are suffering from tyrannies, or where freedom of speech and freedom of the media is attenuated, is exceptionally important. Referring to the country I know best, the work done by the BBC World Service has, over the years, been of enormous significance in the promotion of pluralism around the world. I understand, however, the point made by the Member.</p>
<p class="contents">Radio Free Asia has a budget of about EUR 30 million per year. If we were to take that as the model, we would be talking about committing 30 per cent of the budget for Chapter B7-7. I suspect that the House would regard that as rather a large chunk of the available funds. The Member asked whether establishing a broadcasting medium would be a good use of the funds if we were to have a larger budget and more money to spend on human rights. I suspect that, if this were so, I would have to argue with the Court of Auditors and with Parliament. The policy on democracy and human rights that we now faithfully follow precisely reflects reports by Parliament and the Court of Auditors. It was warmly endorsed for its strategic thrust by both the Council and by the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member concerned has powerful powers of persuasion. His silver tongue might be able to convince Parliament to support this proposition and to change its view on strategic thrust. He may, however, have more difficulty in persuading the Court of Auditors that we should support the core funding that would undoubtedly be necessary in order to establish such a broadcasting medium.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is more sensible to look at other options, including use of the Internet, while wholly concurring with what the Member said about the importance of trying to broadcast the truth to countries where, alas, the truth is obfuscated by darkness and tyranny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nobody should be immune from that sort of scrutiny where taxpayers' money is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look back, I might well wish that European broadcasters had done more at an earlier stage to provide greater competition with CNN. In the field of television news that would have been sensible, but nobody should underestimate the costs and nobody should argue today that it would be easy for Europe to rival the main American international broadcaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
