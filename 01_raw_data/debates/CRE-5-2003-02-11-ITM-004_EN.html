<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marset Campos (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, after the completion of the process of enlargement and of European construction following the Convention and the new Union Treaty of 2003, the European Union will have new borders which will not only require a new form of economic, social and cultural partnership and cooperation with these new neighbours but also, above all, a firm, very broad and effective common foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons depend on the importance of these new neighbours, from the Ukraine and Georgia to Belarus, in which the presence of the giant Russia plays a pivotal role. It is therefore a great challenge for the European Union to do the right thing in terms of how relations with these countries develop.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these countries, Belarus, borders Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and, until 1996, had developed in a fairly similar way to the other former members of the USSR but, since that year, it has taken an authoritarian course which has restricted human rights and democracy and imposed abusive social controls which prevent the European Union from establishing mechanisms for relations, association and cooperation such as the ones it has put in place with the rest of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So much so that the three European institutions which have monitored the development of events in Belarus, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the European Union – the parliamentary troika – has had no hesitation in describing these events as incompatible with minimum democratic requirements and has suspended its relations with that Republic until those requirements are met.</p>
<p class="contents">The presentation of this resolution has been delayed considerably as a result of having to convert an initial draft report on the European Union’s relations with Belarus into an own-initiative resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy due to the deterioration of the situation in terms of the exercise of democracy and respect for human rights in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995, the European Union had prepared an agreement on trade and commercial cooperation based on the agreement which had existed since 1989 between the USSR and the European Economic Community and furthermore the victory of Lukashenko had given rise to a degree of hope. But all of this became deadlocked when in 1996 President Lukashenko put the brakes on the democratisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The authoritarian approach of Lukashenko has been characterised by the adoption of mechanisms to harass the opposition, to eliminate critical voices and to create a network of patronage by means of abuses of power and at the same time has tried to come closer to and more dependent on Russia, which Putin has recently pulled back from. The various elections held since 1996 have been described by the parliamentary troika as lacking in effective democratic guarantees. This has lead to the consolidation of a democratic opposition platform which has been maturing and which involves a broad spectrum, ranging from parties on the right to parties on the left – the communist party for example – which agree on fundamental aspects such as the establishment of democracy, partnership and, when appropriate, integration into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Awareness of the need for democracy is increasing within Belarusian society and there are increasing numbers of members of the current Parliament of Belarus in favour of democratic reforms which bring the legal framework for freedoms closer to the requirements of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the recommendation which we in the European Union must make, and which we are proposing in this resolution, combines two considerations: on the one hand, a firm rejection of reaching an association agreement at this time since that would imply a legitimisation of the current authoritarian regime and would hinder the establishment of democracy, and, on the other, an increase in initiatives which send a clear signal of cooperation and solidarity – with the victims of Chernobyl, for example – or coming closer in social, cultural and trade union terms which will allow democracy to be restored. This is what our proposal is aimed at.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the important role Russia can play in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their significant cooperation and I must finally acknowledge that I do not accept some of the amendments proposed by my own group for the reasons I have just given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to debate Belarus and the relations between Belarus and the European Union. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for his excellent preparatory work. I will indicate, in my remarks, where we find ourselves in profound agreement with what the rapporteur has said.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very sad reality that, as on the many previous occasions when we have discussed Belarus, the focus is on a number of very difficult subjects: on the whole question of the cases of disappeared persons; on the harassment of the media; on the limitations on the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion; on the recent open confrontation by the authorities in Belarus with the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk.</p>
<p class="contents">Alas, we have never been in a position to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus. That country is the only European successor of the former Soviet Union without a privileged contractual relationship with the European Union, including a clear mutual commitment to the common values of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the current state of relations between the European Union and Belarus is profoundly unsatisfactory for both sides. While we are developing new forms of cooperation, for example, with the Russian Federation, while we are about to address the specific challenges and opportunities of enlargement in defining new forms of cooperation with those countries that will be our new eastern neighbours after enlargement, Belarus has sadly chosen the role of spectator.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been invited by the Copenhagen European Council to submit proposals on the EU's future relations with its neighbours, including Belarus. I am sure a number of honourable Members, during this debate, will want to make reference to this 'New Neighbours' or 'Wider Europe' debate. Obviously, we will have to be prepared for the moment when Belarus sends a signal that it is ready to co-operate with us. Given the present situation on democracy, freedom of speech and the media, and on human rights in general, it is difficult to imagine when the EU will be able to have normal relations with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful for the clear message that this debate and Parliament's resolution will send in this respect. However, I fully agree with the elements in the resolution – and I am sure this will be followed up in a number of speeches today – which recalled the importance Belarus has, not only for the European Union, but also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region. I can assure you that this is the common ground we are all working on. There are many issues where the Commission would like to broaden its activities and its co-operation with Belarus, be it in addressing common threats of cross-border organised crime and illegal migration, or in regional development, economic and structural reform, environmental protection and so on. Every day lost in dealing with these issues adds to the hardship of the people of Belarus, and to the potential risks building up on this part of our future eastern border.</p>
<p class="contents">On different occasions, in particular since early 2000, the European Union has co-operated with the OSCE and the Council of Europe to build a bridge that would help Belarus move towards normalisation of its relations with the international community. Belarus has, on several occasions, missed these opportunities, including prior to the elections in 2000 and 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and its Delegation for relations with Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, has been very active in the framework of the Parliamentary Troika with the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. While the European Union has limited its official contacts with Belarus to a strict minimum, this alternative form of political dialogue is very useful and demonstrates that in terms of minimum standards of democracy and human rights, the elected representatives of all three organisations speak with one voice to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission strongly agrees with the emphasis in the resolution on strengthening dialogue with civil society, NGOs, democratic forces, the media and with the universities in Belarus. However, as to the call to the Commission in Article 9 of the draft resolution, to: '…develop a strategy for Belarus within the proposal ‘Wider Europe’ for the democratisation and the development of a social market economy' in Belarus, it seems obvious to me that any assistance or help from the Commission could only be in support of a comprehensive government strategy. It could never replace a strategy by Belarus itself. The driving force for this sort of change would need to come from Belarus. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be there yet.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can and will do in the Commission, is to use the instruments at our disposal to continue support and assistance to grass roots civil society organisations, to journalists and independent media, to universities and also - where it is appropriate - to local authorities. Within the limits of the restrictions set by the September 1997 General Affairs Council, the Commission is also proceeding with technical assistance on border and regional projects, as well as projects linked to the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">When calling for broader engagement in terms of assistance, we should also not forget the difficult ground we are working on in Belarus. It is the authorities, with instruments like the notorious 'Decree No 8', that make the work of foreign donors and their partners in Belarus extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">We had some joint projects with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Belarus. The <span class="italic">de facto</span> closure of the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk last October has obviously threatened the further implementation of such projects. Only after the 19 November 2002 decision of 14 EU Member States to impose a visa ban on President Lukashenko and seven other leading personalities in Belarus was a compromise finally reached to establish a new OSCE Minsk office as of 1 January 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The coming weeks and months will demonstrate whether the authorities in Belarus are finally committed to take the path towards freedom, democracy and an improvement in human rights. Normalised relations with the OSCE could be a first step. Compliance with minimum standards during the coming local elections in early March would be a second step, followed by a convincing commitment to fulfil all the conditions outlined in Parliament's draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the sort of benchmarks that could prepare the way for the eventual accession of Belarus to the Council of Europe and, beyond that, open the perspective for a gradual normalisation of relations with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done to make these things possible – we all hope – in the future.</p>

It is an extremely important debate that Commissioner Patten is drawing to our attention here. The European Union is now going on the offensive and, in its relations with Belarus, is active in a quite different way than it has been in the past. We demonstrably have a pariah state at our borders. In spite of this, it is important that a structured dialogue with Belarus be instituted, as pointed out in a number of amendments by, for example, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Mr Patten intimates what might be the shape of that dialogue. As the European Parliament, it is our task to demand that a structured dialogue of this kind be brought about. What are at stake are cross-border and domestic policy matters of common interest, such as illegal immigration, the sex trade and trafficking in human beings, including women. It is also a question of the European Union’s now adopting a structured approach to instituting discussions and of its putting pressure on the Belorusian authorities, not by isolating them but through active engagement and discussions with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union ought in actual fact to give priority to Belarus in the present situation. Especially in view of the fact that the European Union is so divided in its view of Iraq, it is perhaps a matter of additional urgency that the common foreign and security policy, which was set out in the Treaty of Maastricht and which is now in pieces, be given a dimension relating to Belarus. Precisely now, when we are divided within the European Union, we ought to unite around those areas in which we can take vigorous action. I think we should engage in some self-examination and ask ourselves the question: have we been sufficiently vigorous and energetic when it comes to Belarus?</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus suffers from huge problems, of course. These include a leader who is quite consciously governing his country dictatorially; the disappearance of opposition politicians and others of whose fate we are unaware, such as Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovksy and Yuri Zaharenko. Other problems are a lack of freedom of association, whereby the regime attempts to control the trade unions; legislation governing religious freedom that limits the right of various new evangelical churches to operate freely in that country; and, in addition, politicians who not only disappear but are also imprisoned. We must nonetheless apply a strategy towards the Belorusian authorities that involves our saying: ‘we are not going to isolate you but, rather, conduct a dialogue with you’. Belarus has itself chosen the isolation to which it has been exposed. Let us join forces within the EU in the interests of new relations with Belarus, involving demands for democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who reads the report as it has been adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will find it hard to imagine that it is about a European country that will be a neighbouring state from next May. The mark on its report card is quite plainly devastating. Despite all the efforts in that regard, including on the part of the European Parliament via the parliamentary troika with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the situation for democracy has not improved at all since 1997. In fact you could say that the reverse has been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important conclusion must therefore be that there is no reason to change the policy of more or less frozen relations with the current regime as long as President Lukashenko continues his policy of isolation. This is most deplorable as far as the 10 million inhabitants of that country are concerned, for they deserve better. The politics of that country stand in the way of improvements in relations and are therefore also hindering the desired cooperation in numerous areas, including in the humanitarian sphere. Until such time as President Lukashenko takes a significant step towards greater democracy, it will not be possible for the European Union to implement a positive policy. That is a shame, because this is something we need to do, not least on account of our future borders with the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must, however, continue to support alternative forces in Belarus, such as the independent media as well as the third sector and what we call civil society. Without internal dynamics there, without an internal democratic movement, the situation is not going to change in the near future. Help for the victims of Chernobyl must also be improved. We have already discussed in this Parliament the provision of additional support for cancer hospitals in Belarus in the context of the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Marset Campos’ report also includes an implicit call to the Russian Federation to be more concerned about the democratic credentials of the regime in Belarus. More than once I have watched the Russians congratulate President Lukashenko on an election result after the entire Council of Europe and the EU had rejected it. This is of course unacceptable. This is the kind of contradiction that will get us nowhere. Do the Russians actually intend to create a union with a country whose leadership has such a poor reputation with the European Union and the other European organisations? I therefore ask the Council and the Commission in particular to be more emphatic about this point in consultations with the Russian Federation. The joint economic and political pressure exerted by the European Union and Russia and the need for greater internal dynamics which I have already referred to will ultimately turn out to be deciding factors. Pressure from outside and pressure from within, and especially with some emphasis on the economic element. It is to be hoped that this concept will be reflected in the coming communication about an enlarged Europe. In the meantime, we must make do with the channel that we ourselves helped to create, the parliamentary troika, in order to maintain a minimal dialogue with the country. It does, however, remain depressing and very frustrating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that the country can introduce democracy, human rights and principles characteristic of a state governed by law. We hope that a market economy will be introduced so that the badly afflicted Belorusian people might experience economic prosperity and dare to believe in the future. Unfortunately, we are an infinitely long way away from realising that vision. The trend is completely in the wrong direction, and it is no exaggeration to say that Lukashenko is an odious Communist dictator. His latest professions of friendship for his fellow dictator, Saddam Hussein are no doubt in keeping with what we know about the Belorusian leader.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of atrocities in Belarus is endless: imprisoned and disappeared journalists, persecution, maltreatment, torture of opponents, farcical elections, frequent application of the death penalty and no freedom of expression. Moreover, Belarus is both a country of origin and country of transit when it comes to extensive trafficking in women and children, and a vast number of illegal weapons circulate there.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it is not possible to have any official and formal contacts with the Belorusian regime. Even though I value the idea of a structured dialogue, I wonder how it will be possible for this to take place with the regime in question. However, it is important, just as Commissioner Patten said, to strengthen the limited and courageous opposition that exists: opposition parties, human rights organisations, voluntary organisations and journalists who desperately need our help and who are fighting against extreme odds. This support would be best provided in cooperation with the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the UN. The troika, of which the European Parliament is a part, would also fulfil a very important function.</p>
<p class="contents">There is cause for taking a gloomy view of developments in Belarus, but let us not for that reason betray the Belorusian people, who have had to put up with a great deal, and let us never stop putting pressure on the regime and the authorities. The forthcoming local elections are something to focus on.</p>

That is why it is also an important report that my fellow group member has written, making it apparent to anyone who still needed to be informed, how critical and difficult the situation is and how much is awry in terms of human rights, democracy and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Marset Campos very much for an incredibly good report on a very important topic. Now, the fact is that my group is confederal in nature, and we do not therefore praise each other as a matter of course, but I am nonetheless able to say, on behalf of the Nordic Green Left, that we fully support what Mr Marset Campos has written in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Our confederal nature also means that the group has come up with amendments with which we do not agree and, like the rapporteur, I do not support these. It is apparent from this report that many things are required if, as I hope it one day will, Belarus is ever to reach the point at which it can become a member of the EU. First and foremost, democratic developments are required, and I think that, if it wishes to do so, the EU can play a decisive role in this area. As good democrats, it should be our task to support those activities, inside and outside Belarus, that are aimed at changing how things stand for ordinary people and for the democratic movements. The Church has been mentioned, but I am also thinking of the trade unions and a number of journalists who really are doing a sterling job in moving the country in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This makes it a very important document in the discussions on the subject of Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">It might well be important to reiterate in this context that it is not the European institutions that are isolating Belarus, but the country itself, and the dictator who has plunged it into crisis and who prohibits and represses every form of democratic expression.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a long way from being able to take up normal relations with this country. On that, Commissioner, I agree with you entirely. Despite that, the reality is that Belarus is our neighbour, and we must have an interest in overcoming its self-imposed isolation. If that cannot be done in the context of normal relations, the need still remains for the European Union to develop a strategy for dealing with Belarus. All the same, I think it would be a good thing if you were to turn your attention to item 9, which demands that we should adopt a strategy for dealing with Belarus. To do so would of course result in consideration of where we should have recourse to such important diplomatic instruments as the carrot and the stick, or what sort of instruments we should apply, where we should impose sanctions and where we should offer support. The instruments we have had up to now are inappropriate, so we must modify them to our purposes as regards Belarus. Item 9 sets out with the utmost clarity what they are to be modified to do and in which areas more needs to be done than was done within the last programme. That is what this item is for, and it is my belief that it thus gives the Commission very, very good indications of what to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to reiterate that the local elections and our observation of them will be of great importance to future relations. I hope that this is where we can enjoy very good strategic cooperation with the Commission.</p>

More than 60% of trade between the European Union and Russia already travels through Belarusian territory. After the planned accession of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia to the EU in 2004, Belarus will be one of Europe’s new neighbours. It is therefore extremely important that we have normal relations with her. The fact that the presidential regime in Minsk has blocked this development to date is no reason to throw in the towel. We must communicate with the authorities and civil society in Belarus. The role assigned to the Russian Federation in the present resolution is right. Russia is particularly well-placed to get a foot in the door because of their mutual economic links. This is entirely in line with President Putin’s economic concept of ‘modernisation through Europeanisation’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union’s view, modernity in Europe is inextricably linked to the democratic constitutional state. Belarus under Lukashenko is far removed from that. Honestly, but with compassion for a population that is rapidly becoming impoverished, Mr Marset Campos points to numerous violations of elementary fundamental rights. In this regard, I would like to ask the Council, the Commission and this House to pay special attention in future to the consequences of more repressive religious law in Belarus. How will the registration of Christian communities and churches work out? Surely freedom of religion should not be a matter for Lukashenko and the Orthodox? Observance of this important fundamental right also furthers the normalisation of relations between the EU and Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union should support more reform movements of this sort, which, in the long term, will make the country more democratic.

From May 2004, future members such as Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will share external borders with Belarus, a country contiguous with the European Union, one that is part of the legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse, and one that can, alas, be described, politically, economically and legally speaking, as a problem case lagging behind everyone else. We cannot regard with indifference the regression of a country, soon to be a neighbour to the European Union, into an authoritarian and dictatorial regime. Belarus is increasingly cutting itself off. We see this in the failure to extend the OSCE mission in Minsk. The Council of Europe refuses to let Belarus become a member. Thus, Belarus' isolation is increasing, and so the situation remains utterly unchanged. Parliament's attempt, by means of a report, at exerting some influence, is therefore to be welcomed, even if only because it sends out a signal to encourage the democratic opposition forces, which, although weak, are nonetheless still there, to show signs of life in the forthcoming local elections in March.</p>
<p class="contents">Any country excluding itself in this way from European development cannot do other than become a security problem for the European Union. Because of the <span class="italic">de facto</span> lack of security on the border with its Russian neighbour, with which it has close economic and political ties, Belarus is a main transit country for illegal immigrants travelling from Russia to the EU. In terms of illegal immigration, it is to be regarded as more important as a transit country than as a country of origin. There is thus a clearly perceptible trend towards migration into Austria from the Indian subcontinent and Iraq by way of Belarus and the Ukraine. Over recent months, Minsk has created problems for flights to Austria. Increased numbers of illegal immigrants have been intercepted at Vienna's Schwechat airport, having travelled from Iraq and India and flown from Minsk. A structured dialogue – as soon as circumstances permit – is thus very much to be desired.</p>

Although we may wonder to what extent some countries can become part of Europe, that problem does not exist where Belarus is concerned, for it is in Europe. However, the last assessment of the situation carried out by the Council of Europe a few months ago excludes the possibility of inviting Belarus to join its Parliamentary Assembly. From the point of view of democracy, nothing much has changed, and yet the European Parliament is patiently hoping for an initiative that can further the re-establishment of certain rights. At first, it might even be a case of agreeing on the meaning of individual definitions, for I sometimes have the impression that a dialogue is taking place between deaf people, between two parties who do not understand what the other means by the word ‘democracy’. It is true that there are many reasons why Belarus might want to attach itself to Russia, but it would be in its national interest to maintain a certain balance. The next local elections will, in any case, be measurable evidence of whether any progress has been made in the area of fundamental rights. The abolition of the death penalty, freedom of the press, of association, of religion: these are the minimum conditions, but how long will it take to achieve them so that dialogue can be resumed? In geopolitical terms it makes sense: sooner or later it will happen. An extremely high level of corruption, poverty and disorder catapulted Lukashenko to power in 1994, but his remedy was too brutal: he eliminated some of the corruption but his authoritarian tendencies were combined with the sort of <span class="italic">dirigisme </span>which had already led to the break-up of the Soviet Union, and there has been little change since then.

<p class="contents">In the future it will be wise of us to try and find more positive ways of achieving our aims. After the enlargement of the EU Belarus will be our neighbour, sharing a common border with no fewer than three new Member States: Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.

Multilateral cooperation will provide us with a good forum for cooperation with Belarus.</p>

Indeed, we are in the process of giving wider currency to what, if I may put it this way, is the form of justice we are applying to Iraq. In other words, our aim is to choose regimes rather than recognise states.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a form of logic that may have far-reaching consequences. In fact, it is not for us to pass judgment upon governments. Mr Lukashenko’s regime does not perhaps meet the criteria of our democracies which are themselves, moreover, far from being perfect and, even, increasingly devoid of any content as national sovereignty is progressively relinquished. That being said, my stay in Minsk, to which I was sent by Parliament, enabled me to observe that, in spite of everything, democracy is making real progress there, that the word pluralism is not completely out of place and, above all, that President Lukashenko enjoys a certain legitimacy. This is explained by the fact that, following the collapse of the Soviet regime, he has replaced a succession of ephemeral governments which had exasperated the Belorusian population by, firstly, privatising everything left, right and centre, including even essential public services which thereupon came under the control of Western firms and, secondly and above all, by attempting to detach Belarus from Russia, something to which the Belorusian people could not consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it up to us, as advocated by the report, either to encourage the opposition or any political party whatsoever or, in fact, to turn NGOs into instruments for use in subversion operations. Nor is it up to us to choose this or that economic model for Belarus. Ladies and gentlemen, these are extremely dangerous routes to go down, for there is no way in which international society can live in peace if, by virtue of being rich and strong, a state or states claim the right to overthrow those governments they do not like and, in their place, to designate governments after their own fashion.

It is now politically important, as, in 2004, it will become a neighbouring country of the European Union. One can say in its favour that, unlike some of its neighbours, it remains free of inter-ethnic strife and has unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal, as well as much of its conventional weaponry. It is also rather surprisingly still enjoying an economic growth rate of 4%.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the country deteriorated into authoritarianism and the repression of linguistic and religious rights after the election of Lukashenko as president in 1994. However, he is no Saddam Hussein. The election led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld, corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track, in particular stopping the asset-stripping and tax evasion seen in other CIS countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus is currently under enormous pressure to reinforce its borders with Russia and the Ukraine to avoid any further influx of immigrants, and the European Union must cooperate in this area, irrespective of the nature of the government in Minsk. Private enterprise in Belarus cannot function efficiently, and the effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave concern. There is alleged harassment of the opposition, the silencing of critical voices and the establishment of a network of patronage throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming municipal elections in March 2003 will be a test of the potential for favourable political developments in Belarus, and we hope that observers from this Parliament will be invited. The European Union should await the election results and respond towards Belarus accordingly, in line with a step-by-step policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is growing appreciation within Belarus of the need for democracy; hence the need for greater western contact with pro-democracy parliamentarians to avoid the risk of self-imposed isolationism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if the people of Belarus so wish, we must also offer them the prospect of possible EU membership in the longer term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But since there have been a number of references to the 'Wider Europe' debate, perhaps I could keep Members informed about how our thinking is developing on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to producing a communication on 'Wider Europe' by the time of the March General Affairs and External Relations Council, following the remit that we were given at Copenhagen. It obliges us to look not just at the eastern neighbours - to whom we have turned our attention today - but also at our broader neighbourhood to the south and east. In the context of that communication, we will want to follow the point Mr Väyrynen made so ably about both financial instruments and the importance of the northern dimension and its various component parts in any serious neighbourhood policy. We will want to pursue those points vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish with a telegram of what I said at the outset: we wish to hold out the hand of friendship and cooperation to Belarus, but that demands of Belarus a sea change in its attitude to the political and, frankly, economic values that we hold dear. I hope that there will be sufficient change in Belarus for us to develop a warmer relationship with that important country. However, to borrow a sporting metaphor, the ball is in the Belarus Government's court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
