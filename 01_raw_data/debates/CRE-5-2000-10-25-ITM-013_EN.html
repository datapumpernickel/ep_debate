<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, the Commission has presented a proposal which, under the semblance of a technical adjustment, conceals new budget restrictions for a sector itself already discriminated against within the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and other circumstances have brought the level of aid down to half the level it was at four years ago. The Commission’s proposal, however, consists in stabilising aid at the reduced level and granting aid directly to producer organisations, with which the minimum price regime will disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the end of the year, the Commission is to submit a report on the operation of the COM on fruit and vegetables, possibly supplementing it with new proposals for reform. The Commission justifies the proposal we are now examining on the grounds of urgency. Now, without questioning the urgent nature of the issues dealt with by the Commission, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has identified other urgent issues and also upholds different figures from those in the Commission’s proposal. One of the urgent priorities for the Agriculture Committee is the strengthening of producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that, after the 1996 reform of the COM, the producer organisations became its main instrument. Currently, however, only 40% of fruit and vegetable production is pooled within producer organisations. A COM that only covers 40% of production does not deserve the name. Therefore, if there is any urgency, it lies in encouraging the pooling of supply within producer groups. Since this is an exception in the common agricultural policy and the producers themselves have to cofinance the operational funds, an increase in Community funding is clearly the most obvious instrument for achieving this objective. The Agriculture Committee has therefore proposed an increase in the percentage of Community financing for certain joint schemes involving several producer organisations under certain conditions, especially in the regions most dependent on fruit and vegetable production, or for associations or mergers of producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences in the figures between the Commission’s proposal and that of the Agriculture Committee, which was, in fact, passed almost unanimously, basically centre on aid levels and processing thresholds. The aid requested by the Agriculture Committee may seem excessively high, but we must not allow ourselves to be deceived. What is happening is that the aid levels proposed by the Commission are excessively low and are intended to convert a temporary situation into something permanent, thus eroding farmers’ incomes. This temporary situation has been brought about by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and particular events on the markets. The Agriculture Committee’s line is in fact limited to restoring pre-1996 aid levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, on the subject of aid, the disappearance of the minimum price and paying aid directly through producer organisations may cause problems, particularly in the main fruit and vegetable producing countries. A reasonable level of aid would allow producers’ incomes to be maintained in a particularly difficult situation. To avoid absurd situations of systematic penalisation, the Agriculture Committee has decided to propose setting it at the level of what was produced in recent years. In this way we hope to tailor the aid to the production structure and the ability of the market to absorb the supply, without running the risk of creating surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">One may ask how the amendments will be financed. You see, fruit and vegetables currently receive EUR 445 million less than the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective. It is true that budget neutrality must be respected, but we have to agree on what that means. In my view, budget neutrality consists in keeping within the limits set when the Financial Perspective was adopted. The Commission, however, intends to reduce spending to below the all-time minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that discussion should focus essentially on how to achieve the objectives allocated to the COM and thereafter on establishing budget commitments. It often seems that less is demanded of institutions if they restrict themselves to proposing budget savings. Our main concern should be to improve the effectiveness of the instruments that we have all built up together. Without a budget there can be no building of Europe, and the budget for the fruit and vegetable sector symbolises and reflects many of the main social and territorial imbalances in the common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by thanking my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee. Their understanding and efforts were of great help in reaching a final agreement, which enabled me to draw up this frankly rather difficult report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this reform is necessary, but in its proposal the European Commission is not moving in exactly the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of promoting supply pooling must be met by encouraging producer organisations. Last year, as Mr Jové Peres has said, only 40% of production was marketed through producer associations. Therefore, the amendments approved by the Agriculture Committee and Rural Development, under which up to 50% of the costs of creation and operation can be cofinanced under the EAGGF guarantee for the first five years, answer a need, Commissioner, as does covering the financial aid of 3 to 4.5%, as approved by the Agriculture Committee, of the produce marketed by each producer organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not happy with the thresholds proposed by the European Commission, since they should be adjusted in accordance with market fluctuations. Therefore the approved amendments proposed by the rapporteur on this matter enjoy our full approval.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of products should be extended to include those that may be vulnerable to major falls in prices due to the weather or for cyclical reasons. The Commission’s proposal to reduce the maximum citrus-fruit withdrawal ceiling from 10% to 5% is unjustified and I believe it should not be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain instruments for regulating the market in emergency crisis situations must be introduced to act as a safety net, for example, by exceeding the withdrawal ceiling by about 10% in the event of serious crises.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a gap in the area of labelling. The legislation in force on this issue needs to be changed so that the consumer may be kept fully informed and know whether the product has been made from fresh fruit or not. This is a request and complaint that consumers are always making.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the amendments affecting tomatoes, pears, peaches, cherries, apricots and asparagus, which are of major regional importance and should receive a fixed amount of aid per hectare to improve their competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to dry fruit and nuts, especially hazelnuts, the request to extend the period of aid given to producer organisations that have implemented their improvement plans is still valid, as are the measures specific to this sector which are due to expire in the next round even though there has been no change in their circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of the reforms, which the Agriculture Committee and Rural Development has so insistently called for, should be submitted by 30 June 2001 so that we can see how the sector has been performing. These reforms mean a budget increase, but within the line approved at the Berlin European Summit. The Commission should do its sums again in view of the fact that this ceiling is not exceeded. The difference between the Commission’s proposals and the European Parliament’s is EUR 151. Budget neutrality, Commissioner, does not mean that expenditure under the proposal does not exceed what is currently spent but rather that it stays within what was agreed at the Berlin European Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur and I applaud the teamwork we have achieved. I believe this has been one of the proposals most based on give and take and finding a balance that we have seen in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been pointed out, the Commission has acted without awaiting the report on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 2020/1996, which, according to the Commission, will be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it has not waited for this document – as would have seemed more natural – and has initiated the reform reveals that the Commission either has little interest in the results of its report or could not care less about its contents. With this action, one cannot help feeling that the Commission is determined to reform these regulations at any price. Is the reform that urgent? In my view, if the question is whether or not the regulations need reforming, the answer is yes; but, on the other hand, if the question is whether the reform they need is that contained in the Commission’s proposal, then the answer is clearly no, because improvements in the operating mechanisms of the sector must not be achieved at the expense of precisely one of the sectors that receives least support in Community budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the details given in the report are not known, they cannot grab our attention. The fruit and vegetable sector accounts for an important share of final agricultural production of some 15%, while the financial effort is small and getting even smaller. Whereas, in 1995, it accounted for 5.3% of all spending under the EAGGF guarantee, in 1999 it was down to 3.6%. Added to this are two important details: first the importance of this sector for employment, and, secondly, the frequent concessions affecting the fruit and vegetable sector made under trade agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not intend to oppose these agreements or criticise them, because they are an exercise in solidarity with third-world and developing countries, but it does not seem sensible that the price of solidarity should be paid exclusively by a sector that has never been treated well in Community budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to support Mr Jové Peres’s report without any hesitation. It is an excellent report – for which we congratulate the rapporteur – which provides a balanced reflection of the various interests and agreements involved. Its proposals, such as those that correct the most unfair aspects of the Commission’s proposal, may have favourable consequences. Our support will be unconditional and unqualified. Moreover, I give this support in the belief that the Council will be more sensitive than the Commission to the reasoned and reasonable proposals of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are convinced that the Commission’s proposal is restrictive in budgetary terms, which would mean major financial cut-backs in the sector. It should be remembered that the fruit and vegetable sector is the first common organisation of the market to be financed by its own producers, so it is vitally important to encourage producer organisations and to support an increase in operational funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stressed that the fruit and vegetable sector represents a considerable percentage of final agricultural production in the European Union. Yet it only accounts for 4% of the EAGGF guarantee budget. It should also be remembered that there was broad consensus within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when this report was approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I must mention the predominantly Mediterranean nature of this type of production, which affects several Member States. It is a sector which directly and indirectly generates a vast number of jobs, resulting in highly dynamic economic activity. In general terms it is the main source of income for almost two million families in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stressed that producer organisations, which will be strengthened and encouraged by the amendment introduced by the Agriculture Committee, are extremely important for the rural development of certain districts.</p>
<p class="contents">Fruit and vegetable production is closely linked to the Mediterranean culture and diet, the greatest exponent of a balanced, healthy diet for our consumers. Therefore, an objective that producer organisations must prioritise is the encouragement of quality production.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruit and vegetable sector, however, faces an uncertain future due in part to the erosion of Community preference in the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, which may wipe out all the work that has been done. We must therefore maintain a constructive and vigilant attitude for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also creating greater difficulties for fruit and vegetable growers. Particularly serious are the measures designed to abolish the minimum price, which affects tomatoes destined for processing, the reduction in the limit for aid for operational funds from 4.5% to 3% of the value of the production marketed by each producer organisation, the precautionary reduction of 9.1% of the amount of aid for the first marketing year following the reform of the COM and a reduction in the citrus fruit withdrawal ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">A sector as important in economic, social and strategic terms as this one, particularly for Portugal, with considerable scope for job creation and for supporting the rural development of huge areas of the countries of southern Europe, deserves special attention, which it is not receiving from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, therefore deserve our support, since they seek to correct the unacceptable views held by the Commission, specifically in its proposals against increasing aid to farmers, on increasing thresholds and on resetting ceilings for aid to producer organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the majority of speakers have been Spanish. Our friend and colleague, Mr Jové Peres, has produced an excellent report, which deals with a subject that is both extremely serious and extremely symbolic. It is serious not only because of the numbers involved – almost two million families, or 500 000 jobs are, as we have already heard, affected – but also because, behind the failure of the 1996 reform, there are nevertheless women, men and rural regions which, Mr Fischler, the European Commission has deliberately condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, in Provence to be exact, for a holding of 40 hectares of apples, production costs are twice the sales price, which means that a holding producing 40 000 apples loses EUR 320 000 per hectare per annum. This holding will disappear. To whom shall we apportion the blame? It is not the fault of the tree growers; they have tried to form producer organisations and to build up part-financed operational funds. But in order to do this they need to have revenue and in order to have revenue they must sell. But they do not manage to sell because the powerful purchasing and distribution groups buy outside Europe – obtaining pears from Argentina and apples from Chile, New Zealand and South Africa. Supplies are acquired from these countries because they are cheaper, because workers in the southern Mediterranean or the Pacific have no social protection, because customs duties have been abolished, and because the European Commission is suffering from mad diplomacy disease, that is, the disease of global free exchange!</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of a global foreign policy, Brussels has sacrificed our tree growers, our market gardeners and our horticulturists, who have become a currency of exchange in the free exchange culture. The deal is well known: fruit and vegetables, flowers and wine in the southern hemisphere and, perhaps, industry in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in the words of Comrade Lenin, ‘what is to be done?’. Obviously we must adopt the excellent relief amendments put forward by Mr Jové Peres, who has produced an outstanding report, and those of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without the pretext of budgetary neutrality. There is no lack of money to throw at Kosovo, at the Balkans, at Indonesia and at Asia. But if we do not put an end to the global drift in European integration, little by little not only will the farmers disappear, but the whole of Europe will drown in the ocean of the global market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would now seem to be irrefutable that since 1996 – the year which saw a complete revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables – there has not been any form of discussion, even though it had always been intended, on the impact of the COM in that sector, despite the fact that it has reached its third year of application: a period of time that has to be seen as long enough for introducing any reform initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The interests of an entire industry are at stake, an industry which employs almost 2 million people in the central southern areas of the Mediterranean countries, universally acknowledged to be among the poorest countries in the European Union. The fruit and vegetable sector is struggling between production quotas and world-wide liberalisation of the markets for want of a policy for research into biotechnological innovations. It is the processing sector which feels the effects of the Marrakech international agreements most of all, even though it accounts for 16% of the value of European Union agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">If the philosophy behind the new COM is to promote the system of associations of producer organisations as an alternative and a complement to the European economic system of large-scale distributors, it would be appropriate for this policy to be bolstered with the financial resources needed to implement the operational programmes, ensuring real financial assistance of at least 4.5% of the marketed production instead of the 3% proposed by the Commission. In order to be able to continue to work, producers are calling for the adoption of legislation which will support the development of the fruit and vegetable sector, not hamper it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Based on reinforcing the economic power of producers, creating collective projects and contracting with public authorities within the framework of part-financed operational funds, the results of this reform have finally proved to be inadequate and disappointing. The reform has not brought the future we all hoped for at the outset because, in fact, as was highlighted by a previous speaker, the membership rate of the producer organisations has remained very low: less than 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the producer organisations have been unable to have a real impact on controlling and promoting products in the fruit and vegetables sector. At the same time, although the EAGGF budget for this sector has been increasing steadily since 1997, it has nonetheless always been tightened during the accounting period because of the actual under-utilisation of appropriations due to the unsuitability of the rules of allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are thus faced with a paradoxical situation where one of the most important sectors of European agriculture, which covers 20% of production units, employs a great deal of manpower in production and processing, and accounts for 16% of final agricultural production, is ultimately one of the sectors least taken into account by the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I naturally want to highlight the opportunity provided by the Commission proposal that we are debating this evening. But I want, above all, to congratulate Mr Jové Peres on the quality of his report, whose judicious proposals aim to improve even more significantly the results of this production channel for the countries of southern Europe, most notably by setting public support at 4.5% of the value of the marketed production and by increasing it in some cases to 6% in order to encourage producer organisations to pool their produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the Council of Ministers will make a speedy decision in respect of this reform so that it can come into force in 2001 with the appropriate funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a difficult topic to deal with in the middle of this crisis which has struck the vegetable and fruit sector in certain parts of Europe. I subscribe to that analysis, and we must also use that analysis in the forthcoming WTO negotiations so that we can adopt a firm stance in favour of those products which do not enjoy market protection. These, too, must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to highlight is the position of the producers. I subscribe to the rapporteur’s plea to intensify support for the producers and to strengthen their position, and I consider these initiatives to be essential. For in the present commotion caused by buying-in organisations which operate on behalf of supermarkets, the question could gradually arise of whether there might not be too much merging and amalgamating on the part of these organisations, and of whether the latter might not slowly but surely be securing monopoly positions for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one possible answer to this: the producer organisations need to adopt a more powerful stance and improve the way in which they are organised. In my view, this would be more effective than injecting more money into the sector. The sector must secure a stronger market position. And I must also say that, in my view, this is more effective, especially with regard to vegetables and fruit, as well as delicate products which need to be sold quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a number of observations with regard to the distribution of processing and threshold quotas across the countries. I have noticed that these are not evenly distributed on a number of counts. And I am also expecting the rapporteur to produce an oral amendment tomorrow with regard to at least one of the countries involved in the processing of pears. But if you consider the distribution across the Southern countries, for example the position of Portugal compared to other countries, one can ask oneself whether this distribution is even in every respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I would like to say, and in that sense I would also like to follow the line adopted by our spokesperson, Mrs Rodondo, that it is essential to strengthen the position of producers and for producer organisations to become stronger, because I can tell you, this is necessary; they must secure a firmer foothold in the market, and the policy will need to be drafted to that effect. While we have a common organisation of the market and claim, on the one hand, that we do not want more money injected into it, this will only be effective if we, on the other hand, also consider the production side and possibly a certain level of control of this. But in this report, I am precisely in favour of strengthening producer organisations, also by way of responding to this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we change some points now in anticipation of that, the Commission will then have to use this evaluation immediately to review the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and make the necessary changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Joining together producer groups and forming producer associations, and commercial cooperation between producer organisations from various regions, are all particularly important for the fruit and vegetables market sector. This should be the starting point for the COM. Nevertheless, we also have to bear in mind those farmers who energetically sell part of their production direct to consumers from their farms, for the benefit of themselves and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">For many farms, direct sales bring much-needed additional income, and they are often run by farmers' wives as an independent part of the business. Furthermore, direct sales from the farm emphasise the regional nature of products and thus appeal to a certain type of consumer. The amendment to Article 11(1)(c) must therefore be framed in such a way that producers, in agreement with producer groups, can sell a proportion of their products – to be agreed on a case-by-case basis – direct to consumers for their personal use.</p>
<p class="contents">If the present rigid limit is maintained, producer organisations will be obliged to expel members who do not respect these rules. The result would be that the producer organisations' sales volume would fall and that they would lose their influence over these producers' direct sales activities, as regards complying with quality standards, observing production guidelines and pursuing joint market strategies. I therefore ask you to take this into account also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In several provinces in southern Spain the proportion is over 80% and it is the only driving force for development and employment in the rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this produce has lost Community preference and has to compete abroad without the shelter of compensation that the traditional continental products enjoy, through roughly 70% of the EAGGF appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this sector seems to be the hard currency used in preferential agreements with third countries and in the subsequent reviews of their protocols, with the added disadvantage that these countries produce without the economic, social and environmental conditions we have in Europe, but with the same timetables as our own producing areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is neither fair nor equitable, because it is neither fair nor equitable to have to compete abroad without the protection that continental products enjoy. Neither is it fair and equitable if the budget neutrality set at EUR 1 900 million in Agenda 2000 is not fulfilled because of internal obstacles and penalties incurred through the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe this proposal clearly leaves room for improvement, and the report by Mr Jové, whom I most sincerely congratulate, sets the standard for doing so. This would be both appropriate and fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the guarantee thresholds for different types of fruit and vegetable need to be raised with a view to harmonising the real production of the European Union and responding better to levels of demand. This is why I would particularly highlight the need for guarantee thresholds to be raised for tomatoes grown for processing in Portugal, which should at least approach the figure of 953 000 tonnes set at the Berlin Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to point out that the level of aid per tonne proposed by the Commission is quite inadequate. I think that what is needed is an increase of the kind proposed by the rapporteur. The truth is that the abolition of the minimum price, which is about to end, will result in a considerable reduction in prices paid for produce and we need to ensure that farmers’ incomes do not suffer as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the level of operational funds is also completely inadequate. In fact, as the rapporteur proposes, unless the level of financing the funds improves, we will not be able to improve the way in which producer groups work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that the Commission has wasted a superb opportunity to make the CAP a little fairer. As the Commissioner knows, a sector that accounts for 16% of agricultural production only receives 4%, in fact less than 4%, of the budget. The European Union’s fruit and vegetable producers are at the moment basically living from their income from the market, in other words, from what they sell on the market. They suffer the risks and uncertainties inherent in the market and are pitted against fellow farmers in other countries, who produce other products such as cereals, oilseed, beef, milk and so forth, and whose income is guaranteed by the CAP, with no risk to themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we must put an end to this inconsistency within the CAP as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, this does not take away the fact that there may be – and in fact are – diverging positions, as there will be tomorrow when the vote reflects this, just as there may be approaches which comprise or support calling for amendments. It would appear that the Commission and the Council's line takes little account of the methods used to grow certain products with specific characteristics in a specific social environment – as one of the Members who has just spoken also pointed out – with regard to certain sectors: I refer to tomatoes for the processing industry, citrus fruit and also nuts.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that certain subsidies have been particularly depleted, not only by the general fall in the euro which we have witnessed recently – in which regard it would be appropriate to take action before the situation degenerates into a dispute with the European establishment as a whole – but also with regard to the attitude to be adopted in respect of Mediterranean products. Totally justified protests and accusations have been made recently but, at Parliamentary level, there have been some proposals as well: proposals relating to the ceiling on financial assistance, proposals to standardise the benefits due to all producers' associations irrespective of the legal basis, a proposal – which, I feel, must be supported – to continue support for production for longer than the current three year period, and lastly, for specific products, in particular nuts, the proposal for a particularly fair assessment of the aid or subsidies to be allocated.</p>

But without wishing to indulge in special pleading, the situation in the fruit and vegetable sector is visibly deteriorating. Growth in volume, imports from third countries, fluctuations in consumption – be it in quantity or quality – are the most important reasons for this. The situation is becoming more critical, even if it is not as critical as Mr Martinez says. For example, you can live very well from 40 hectares in the area I come from, the South Tyrol.

<p class="contents">For example, when you consider that the fruit and vegetable sector is allocated 3.8% of the relevant budget, as compared with the 41% allocated to arable crops, then you cannot help feeling that a decimal point might have been put in the wrong place. Unfortunately, the decimal point is in the right place. We are talking about just 3.8%. This is a handicap that works to the advantage of another agricultural sector, that is arable crops, where there is surely more room for manoeuvre than in the case of fruit and vegetables. International trade agreements are to some extent at the expense of this fruit and vegetable sector and therefore benefit other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this additional financial restriction will be hard to cope with and I hope that the Commissioner, the Commission and the Council will have the insight to make sure that a third handicap is not added to the two existing ones simply because of a desire to make additional savings in a particular way here, and that Parliament's wishes and proposals and those of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I go into the details of the report, I would like to thank both Mr Jové Perez for his report, and the members of the Committee for the time and effort they have devoted to the 61 amendments. One thing is clear to me: as with any totally new system, the practical experience that we have gained in recent years suggests that the market organisation for fruit and vegetables must be the subject of a review as well, and it must also be fine-tuned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the representatives of the sector itself agree with the Commission that there are some key problems that we should solve as quickly as possible. That was the reason why the Commission to some extent anticipated the report and brought forward this proposal for discussion without waiting for the final report.</p>
<p class="contents">We concentrated on four areas: the double upper limit for financing the operational fund, the operation of the support system for tomatoes for processing, the level of quotas for tomatoes, citrus fruits and pears, and export refunds. But the fact that we anticipated these four areas does not mean that we will not present the report required in the COM. We will do that in any case, and will we do so before the year is out.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I can see from many amendments, you have taken advantage of this opportunity, and in addition to the four subjects brought forward for debate by the Commission, you have also anticipated the final report. There is accordingly a certain discrepancy between the Commission's views and what you are proposing here.</p>
<p class="contents">What principles has the Commission been guided by in producing its proposal? In view of the budget situation and the Berlin decisions, any proposal that would have led to substantial increases in budgetary expenditure in favour of a specific sector would have been unrealistic. The proposal is therefore based on the principle of budgetary neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of course aware that appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector – leaving bananas aside – have fallen since the 1996 reform and that the Agenda 2000 forecasts have also not been fully met. Two factors are chiefly responsible for this. First, expenditure on support for the operating fund has risen far less than expected, the reason for this being that the number of members in the producer organisations has not grown as much as was hoped, and, second, rising world prices and value of the dollar had to be taken into account when calculating processing aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission proposal aims at extensive simplification, by harmonising the existing processing rules for the most important products and also making them more transparent. For tomatoes, pears, peaches and citrus fruits, individual thresholds for Member States have been set in addition to the Community threshold, and permanent aid is paid direct to the producer organisations. One advantage of the proposed amendment is that on the basis of the future aid contribution – which has now been set for an indefinite period – the producer organisations can freely negotiate the price for unprocessed products. This will make minimum prices superfluous in future. Furthermore, the introduction of a single guaranteed upper limit for contributions to the operational fund will simplify both the creation and implementation of operational programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">With these principles in mind, I would now like to turn to the amendments you have proposed. As I see it, they can be divided into three groups. The first group consists of general comments on the COM. Amendments Nos 1, 2, 44 and 19 relate to strengthening the role of the producer organisations, Amendments Nos 8, 14, 26, 27 and 35 relate to increased support for peripheral regions and less favoured regions, and to trade measures; Amendments Nos 17, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56 and 59 relate to reporting arrangements for the COM. Amendments Nos 3 and 4 are about an increase in EU appropriations for the fruit and vegetable sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, none of these general comments on the COM has any place in the proposal before us, because they anticipate the proposal that we are still considering, and should therefore be discussed in conjunction with this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of amendments are specific requests relating to the functioning of the COM, for example Amendment No 5 on new raw manure, and Amendments Nos 27, 21, 25 and 34 on special support measures for severe crises. Amendment No 18 is intended to improve the scope for direct sales, and Amendments Nos 22 to 24 relate to the operational fund. Amendments Nos 28 to 30, 33, 36, 37 and 38 concern inter-branch organisations, nuts and withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the first group of amendment, the proposal we are discussing today is not the right place for these amendments and I cannot therefore accept them. But I do admit that both groups contain some interesting points which the Commission will carefully consider in relation to the reports to be presented by the year end. I would like to point out that a proposal to the Council adopted on 5 October already covers consideration of an increase in appropriations for nuts.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments does relate to the proposal actually being debated here. Amendments Nos 6 and 25 propose an increase in Community support via the operational funds. The aim of Amendments Nos 31 and 32 is to strike out the reductions in market withdrawal ceilings proposed by the Commission. Amendments Nos 67 and 68 address water consumption, and Amendments Nos 9, 11, 15, 16, 40, 41, 51, 53, 57, 60 and 61 in various ways propose increases or changes in processing thresholds and aid for tomatoes, peaches, pears, and citrus fruits.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 39 proposes simplification of the procedure for adjusting new products in the processing sector. Amendment No 43 relates to transitional arrangements for tomatoes and Amendment No 12 calls for a study on the abolition of the minimum price. Lastly, Amendments Nos 62 to 66 provide for direct aids for producers not involved in processing. Most of the amendments in this group would result in an increase in appropriations which in some cases would be substantial, and are thus very much at odds with the principle of budget neutrality. I cannot therefore accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the issue of the overall level of Community financing for this sector is also to be discussed by the Council on Monday. I am sure that these discussions will continue, and that this point will also be an important part of the final decision on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Amendments Nos 41, 53, 67 and 68 would complicate the system rather than simplify it, and the framework system does not cover Amendment No 12. However, the Commission agrees with the substance of Amendment No 39, but we will consider how to improve the drafting for legal purposes. Amendments Nos 62 to 66 change the existing system in a way that would jeopardise efforts to develop producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to make the following comment. Any delay suffered by the Commission proposal would result in most of the changes due to come into force under this proposal with effect from 1 January 2001 or as from the start of financial year 2001/2002 not coming into effect until a year later. The Commission regards this as an unnecessary disadvantaging of this sector. That is why this proposal has been presented at this point, and I hope that Parliament will adopt its opinion this week and that the Council will adopt the proposal before the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
