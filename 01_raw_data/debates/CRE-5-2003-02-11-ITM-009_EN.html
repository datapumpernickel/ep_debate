<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, honourable Members, the Copenhagen summit was a great triumph, a success both for the new Member States and for the European Union, a success for all those who have worked for so many years to enable the enlargement to take place, adding the new Member States, the candidate countries in Eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus. It also made it possible to conclude negotiations on the financial package, which is not entirely straightforward.</p>
<p class="contents">With effect from their accession, starting in May 2004, the new Member States will be able to participate in all the support programmes funded by the European Budget. Involvement in market measures will facilitate the promotion of agriculture. Farmers will receive direct grants in aid, and the aid will be particularly important to farmers with small farms.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 6.7 billion of Structural Fund resources are to be allocated to the financing of projects in the areas of employment, infrastructure, higher environmental standards and the improvement of transport routes. The new Member States will participate to an increased extent in the research programmes, and in everything else – programmes to promote energy and the environment, student exchanges and the youth programme.</p>
<p class="contents">And, of course, progressively more and more staff from the new Member States will be working in and for the European Union in Brussels and Luxembourg. And a new programme – an entirely new programme – is to be set up: the so-called Schengen facility, intended to co-finance controls at the external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial planning will need to be adjusted in order to anchor these items of expenditure in the Budget. What resulted from the Copenhagen negotiations was a balanced compromise between different interests. The financial framework for enlargement remains within the framework fixed in 1999 by the Inter-institutional Agreement for the period 2000-2006. Today, the Commission adopted its proposal for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective. In it, the results of the Copenhagen negotiations are allotted to the individual headings. At the same time, the Financial Perspective is adjusted in line with the prices current in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal on enlargement states that, when expressed in current prices, the resources for agriculture and the Structural Funds, for internal policies and administration amount in total to an increase in commitment appropriations of EUR 45 billion, an increase which is still within the Berlin framework. To put it another way, the upper limits are being reduced by EUR 1.7 billion in comparison with the hypothetical upper limits in the Inter-Institutional Agreement for the period up to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of this, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commission's proposal relating to the category of pre-accession aid, category 7. We propose that this be left unchanged. In future, it is from this that pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania is to be paid, and we propose that these aid packages should, as against the 2003 amounts, be increased by 20%, 30%, and then, in 2006, by 40%, thus reaching, in 2006, an absolute maximum of EUR 1.4 billion. I think that this considerable aid for both these states will then have the effect of enabling us to work intensively on helping them achieve their objective of becoming Member States of the European Union in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council also propose that pre-accession aid for Turkey, funded up to now from the foreign affairs budget, should in future be funded from category 7. We will shortly be presenting a proposal for a considerable increase in the aid given to Turkey. I believe it to be in the common interest of the European Union that efforts at reform be strongly supported by resources for pre-accession aid.</p>
<p class="contents">A new category has to be created in the Financial Perspective for entering free-standing financial aid, the so-called lump sum transfers agreed on in Copenhagen, into future Budgets. We propose that this category should similar in every respect to the adjustment of the Financial Perspective that was made when the EU was last enlarged by the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, when lump sums were also agreed on, thus requiring the insertion of a new category into the Financial Perspective as it stood at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission have decided on the following proposal as regards Cyprus: as the tables for enlargement agreed on at the Copenhagen European Council do not yet include feasible resources – in the form of financial aid – for Northern Cyprus, the Commission is now submitting to you two tables, one for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective with Northern Cyprus and one without it. The significance of this in concrete terms is that, in the event of a political solution being found for Northern Cyprus, the whole process will not have to go back to the beginning and start again; instead, the adjusted table, with EUR 273 million more than that without Northern Cyprus, can become effective at once. I believe, firstly, that this way of doing things sends out the right political signal and, secondly, that it is of course the simpler option from the procedural point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, the Budget for the 25-Member European Union will no longer make any distinction between new and old Member States. The next Budget, for 2004, can, in accordance with the proposal, amount to a maximum of 1.12% of gross national income – equivalent to EUR 115 billion – in commitment appropriations and 1.08% – that is to say EUR 111 billion – in payment appropriations. In accordance with item 25 of the Inter-Institutional Agreement of 1999, this Commission proposal will now be debated and processed by both Parliament and the Council, as the Inter-Institutional Agreement states quite clearly that adjustment of the Financial Perspective in the course of any enlargement is a matter for a joint resolution by Parliament and the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The next trilogue is to be held as soon as next Thursday, when we will have the first opportunity to do interinstitutional work on the basis of the Commission proposal, in order to be able to create in good time the framework for the first Budget for a 25-Member European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being so, your question relates to category 3 of the Financial Perspective, that of internal policies, including many individual programmes in support of the Lisbon process. According to the Copenhagen resolution and the Commission proposal, the increase for internal policies will amount, in 2004, to a total of EUR 1.6 billion, then EUR 1.5 billion, then EUR 1.5 billion again, all at current prices. Of these amounts, approximately EUR 1 billion per annum will be allocated to the traditional internal policy areas, that is to say, the category 3 programmes, and these resources will then be divided up between the individual programmes within the 2004 Budget procedure. There will then, depending on the procedures, some of which will involve codecision, be a joint resolution on the extension of the financial framework in the individual programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the Commission has also, at the same time, decided on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in 2004 prices, so this results in a difference. Let me point out that we have also included Cyprus in one of the tables.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as your second question is concerned, I would like to say by way of reply that the 1999 Inter-Institutional Agreement was an agreement between all three institutions and so the Council, too, has to adhere to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before such figures are incorporated into the acts, then, one must therefore trace the reasoning behind the question as to whether and to what extent it is necessary to go much further in examining these matters in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer given to Mr Colom i Naval's question obliges me to put a second one. Where, in fact, does the Commission stand? After all, it is perfectly clear that the tables and figures from Copenhagen are to be regarded as a minimum to be guaranteed only until such time as there is a policy on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement. I would like to take this opportunity specifically to ask the Commission to do everything possible to prevent the Council from attempting to create precedents through the back door, and doing lasting damage to the institutional structure in matters of Budget law. The procedure over the coming weeks will find the Commission also having to decide whose side it is on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Copenhagen, there were lengthy negotiations rather than calculations. Figures were laid down for the internal policy areas as they were for the others, stating how much was allocated. Let me also reiterate that there will be new programmes in the internal policy areas, the Schengen facility being one example. None of the programmes that we have had in the 15-Member EU can be compared with it. Even the programme specifically for supporting the decommissioning of atomic power stations is a new one. In future, all the new Member States will of course be able to participate in the existing programmes – as indeed some of them already do – and approximately EUR 1 billion per annum has been allocated to the adaptation of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to your question about what is to be done in a situation where we have the Copenhagen resolutions on the one hand, the accession treaties on the other, and then, of course, the Inter-Institutional Agreement, which emphasises the need for a joint decision on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, the Commission has constantly been committed to stressing this point to the Council. This is again stated in the Copenhagen resolutions. At that time the European Council stated that the Commission, in its proposal, had to take into account the table summarising the outcome of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the results of the negotiations were not easily achieved. The candidate countries, too, engaged in in-depth negotiations not only with regard to the amount to be spent, but also to the structure the expenditure should have. I think this is something we have to respect. It was for this reason, for example, that the Commission took on board these proposals and negotiation results as regards the amount of the Structural Funds in comparison with the lump sum transfers. I consider it very important, and as a very good thing, that we will, as early as next week, have the opportunity to join with the Council in discussing how we should take matters further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These accession treaties are, of course, binding in international law, and they also stipulate sums of money that would ordinarily, had we dealt with them together and subject to the conditions of the Financial Perspective, have been decided on in the codecision procedure, so that we could have gained some influence over the negotiations. If it is now assumed that the Copenhagen figures will be incorporated into the treaties and will be definitively laid down only in an approval procedure that is to take place very soon, there is, as you said, the <span class="italic">de facto</span> possibility of influencing the Financial Perspective in a codecision procedure involving the interested parties in the budgetary authority, or are we being thrown back on the ‘do or die’ position, in which we can only accept or reject? This notwithstanding the fact that it would go against the overall thinking behind the <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>devised as long ago as 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second question. You have announced your intention of creating a category of pre-accession aid that will, in future, include Bulgaria and Romania, and that aid will be increased. Bulgaria and Romania have for the past ten years already been going through a quite specific process covering individual aspects such as the implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and other such things. You have said that you have proposed that another state be included in this category of pre-accession aid, namely Turkey, which has not, to date, had a status comparable to that enjoyed by Bulgaria and Romania; nor are negotiations with Turkey anything like as far advanced as those with the other states. Are you now putting these countries on one and the same footing? Is the Commission proposing that we aim to give Turkey the same status as Bulgaria and Romania, and what can you adduce in support of this approach, involving as it does an assessment that goes far further than before? If we are talking in terms of pre-accession aid – and we have, in the past, heard various things from various sources, including that President Prodi is an advocate of Croatia and other Balkan countries getting candidate country status – are these countries already included in the category 7 that you are now providing for, or, if not, how are we going to be dealing with them over the coming years? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was also the limitation within which the Commission proposal was drafted and the negotiations with the candidate countries were held.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to re-emphasise the fact that the judicial issue is of crucial importance as regards the significance of the approval of the accession treaties with their figures, as against the negotiations on the Inter-Institutional Agreement. This is something to which we will have to give very careful attention in our discussion in next week's trilogue.</p>
<p class="contents">What has to be said about Turkey is that the Council has this year also adopted the proposal that Turkey should be included in category 7, thus becoming entitled to pre-accession aid. We have a sort of pre-accession strategy where Turkey is concerned, and the legal basis on which category 4 aid – another very ‘internal’ debate – is paid includes precisely this expression, so that no new legal basis would be required to transfer Turkey – financially speaking – from category 4 to category 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to your question on the Balkans, I have this to say. As has, this year, emerged from many reports in the press, Croatia has decided to apply for membership of the EU. It is now for the Council to consider what happens next; it will probably ask the Commission to examine the matter, with which request the Commission will of course comply. It is not for us, at present, to consider whether another state is to be included in category 7.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, again like to point out that the Commission is proposing that category 7 be left unchanged and that adjustments be made to the financial programme for categories 1 and 2, covering agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal policies and administration to take account of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a question regarding heading 6 of the financial perspective. If I have understood correctly, you have not said anything about this. Has the Commission or the Council ever considered expanding the Guarantee Reserve in connection with the increased activities of the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, in the new Member States? My second question is as follows: there was always a monetary reserve, which had to do with the CAP, and especially with those countries which were not members of the euro zone. We are soon to be joined by ten countries, none of which is to be a member of the euro zone. Is the monetary reserve now no longer necessary, and what are the reasons for this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, heading 4 was not on the agenda in Copenhagen, and as regards heading 3, there was the Commission proposal on the framework, as laid down in the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement, and there were the negotiations on the specific programmes that are now being brought in. As I said, they include the Schengen facility as well as the programme – which I consider to be of the utmost importance – to provide further help to build effective administrations, and the programme for decommissioning nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Mr Mulder's question about the monetary reserve, a decision was made in 1999 – and this is also laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement – to abolish the monetary reserve, which is why it no longer exists. As far as the Guarantee Fund is concerned, the situation is that the Guarantee Fund has also had to be used to guarantee loans to the accession countries and for example for various EIB programmes. Once the accession countries are Member States it will no longer be necessary to make the relevant guarantees available in the budget. In other words, after enlargement the Guarantee Fund will have more scope to support loans to third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
