<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, until recently I believed that Uganda was one of the better African states in terms of human rights. A fortnight ago Amnesty International, as part of Refugee Week, arranged for MEPs to be partnered with refugees for a day. The reason for doing this was simply to allow politicians to understand at first hand the experiences of people who become refugees and to listen to why they had to escape from their home countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the privilege to meet a Ugandan refugee living in Scotland whose name is Innocent Jakisa. He has been given refugee status to stay permanently in the United Kingdom. His story was shocking. I do not have the time to go into detail here. He was not from the north of the country but was a disabled rights activist who spoke out against his government.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Paragraph 5 of the resolution, calling on the Ugandan Government to introduce good governance and political pluralism, is absolutely vital. Freedom of speech is essential for democracy. Uganda has come a long way from the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin, but there is still much to do. The fact that there are no political parties in Uganda should be a cause for concern to us in the EU and although the president is supposed to lift this 17-year ban on multi-party democracy, subject to referendum, this process needs to be closely monitored by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the substance at hand in the resolution, the treatment of children in the northern part of Uganda is of serious concern. Only a few weeks ago, a number of schoolgirls were abducted by the brutal rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army. If they are not found their fate will be one of sex slaves to militia commanders. According to Jo Becker of Human Rights Watch: 'The increase in abductions is dramatic and alarming.' More children have been taken in the last ten months than in any previous year of the conflict. Since the military offensive by the Ugandan Government, in just over a year, it is estimated that 5 000 children have been abducted. In the year before it was less than 100. In the 17 years of conflict between the Ugandan Government and the LRA, it is estimated that 20 000 children have been abducted.</p>
<p class="contents">Much needs to be done. I hope that in future the children of Uganda will be able to live peacefully and that people like Innocent will have their human rights respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is right to denounce the serious situation in the north of Uganda, with a huge number of abductions of children who are used as child soldiers, sex slaves and carriers; in short, children who, under death threats and in life-threatening circumstances, are kept in slavery or are even required to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for this lies in various quarters. It has already been stated here that the Ugandan Government is no soft touch. It would be useful if the European Union looked closely at all unchecked budgetary aid that goes to Uganda, from the Member States and from us, because Uganda is no model state. There may have been progress in a number of areas, but the reports of systematic cases of torture deserve a close inquiry. This applies, for example, to the cause of death of a certain Mr Murisidi, who died in a police cell.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Uganda leaves the population at the mercy of the terror of the ‘Lord's Resistance Army’. It is unable to guarantee the safety of the people of the northern province and neither has it succeeded in involving the LRA in peace talks, despite increased military expenditure on the part of Uganda and despite Uganda's military presence in the east of Congo where their presence is apparently more lucrative.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Sudan, however, does not get off scot-free either. Sudan denies any responsibility in the crimes of the LRA's rebels. It is obvious that these receive weapons from the Sudanese army itself. I have the testimony of religious leaders who described in detail a huge arms delivery, in mid-March 2003, of bombs, various types of grenades, and hundreds of boxes containing everything from bullets to uniforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, as long as the LRA is armed, they will shoot, kill, and abduct children rather than negotiate peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The escalation of the conflict in northern Uganda<span class="bold"> </span>is reaching unprecedented levels and is causing a genuine humanitarian crisis. Approximately a million people have been displaced in Acholiland and in the Lango and Iteso regions. At the beginning of the year, the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative seemed to have achieved unmatchable results. A number of meetings were held between the religious leaders and the rebels; a presidential peace commission was even set up with many responsibilities; the LRA and the government called for a cease-fire. In May, for the first time, the Consultative Group Meeting discussed the crisis in northern Uganda as a national issue, and there were substantial contributions from civil society. Despite these small rays of hope, the conflict has been deteriorating severely over the past two months. For the first time since the start of this distressing affair, rebel activity has intensified and has carried on for over six months, breaking the traditional mould of cycles of violence which initially took the form of brief raids rather than permanent conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, it has become clear from the LRA’s order to attack Catholic missions that the Sudanese Government has renewed its support for the LRA, providing sophisticated heavy armaments. Joseph Kony, the leader of the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army, spoke again last Monday, telling his men to kill mercilessly anyone who comes within range, including the elderly and children, to spare only pregnant women, to kill priests and missionaries in cold blood and to beat up nuns in cold blood. The crazy orders were given over the frequency used by the network of two-way radios belonging to the Catholic missions of northern Uganda. Indeed, the rebels are able to use the same two-way radios in their internal communications as those used by missionaries for they have plundered numerous Catholic parish churches in recent months. Moreover, despite the fact that the humanitarian situation is getting worse and that rebel activity is clearly on the increase, the Ugandan Government has announced that the situation is still under control. In this regard, I must highlight the prodigious efforts of the European Commission to help these people, not least through monitoring in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">At this confusing time, marked by violence, terror and war, the real danger is that of resorting to weapon-power as the only way of addressing this serious situation. Moreover, there is also the risk that the international community and citizens will hide behind indifference, treating this disaster as the concern of the Acholi people alone. We have to take notice of the cries of the people and the leaders of Acholiland: sadly, their story has already proven that peace can never be achieved by forcing a people into submission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issues that are addressed under the emergency procedure, and today provides yet another example of this, deal with extremely important matters. I would, therefore, like us to consider the possibility of not always tabling human rights for Thursday afternoon, when only a few Members are present. I believe that issues as serious as human rights and freedom of expression deserve that this item be moved from time to time to a more suitable point on the agenda, when more Members are present.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Uganda, this country has for a long time been considered to be a window onto development in East Africa. Today, however, it is the worst location for attacks on physical integrity and for breaches of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s slaves were kidnapped, thrown into ships’ holds and traded for goods or money. Having cleared their consciences – particularly in Durban where they condemned slavery as a crime against humanity – western countries ended up forgetting that other forms of slavery still exist. Today, slaves do not wear chains or work in cotton fields, slavery does not need the colour issue to stamp its authority more thoroughly on black people whose souls have been destroyed. No! Slavery today takes the form of so-called resistance armies that claim to serve self-proclaimed ‘lords’ and all of this results in the tragedy with which we are familiar today: that of child soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Child soldiers, it should be pointed out, are children who, as Kourouma explains very well in his book, are forced to kill a member of their family in order to become a child soldier. They are sexually exploited, as has already been said. There are around 20 000 such children in Uganda today and one reason why this tragedy is allowed to happen is that a whole host of countries is giving logistical, financial and military assistance to countries such as Sudan and Uganda.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say that in this regard too, I have the feeling that our own policies employ double standards. A few weeks ago, I visited Togo, a country to which, perhaps rightly, we have refused to give aid in the fields of health and education. It is, therefore, being punished. At the same time, a country such as Uganda is being supported by the United States. At the same time, conventions that we have signed up to, such as ‘Everything but Arms’, are not being duly applied in Uganda, where arms trading still goes on throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish I could be sure that all the conventions on trade on the ground, of weapons in particular, were being properly implemented in countries such as Uganda. I also wish I could be sure that the various conventions that we have signed are more than just labels to ease our consciences, because signing up to the convention protecting the rights of the child or to an entire set of conventions intended to protect basic rights does not mean that we can carry on acting as if nothing were wrong. If the serious attacks on human rights, the breaches of children’s rights and the murders are the everyday lot of Ugandans, we must shoulder our responsibilities. This does not mean conducting a policy that employs double standards; it means real sanctions and monitoring the aid with which we provide that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does the Ugandan Government’s failure to exercise any military power result from unwillingness, from powerlessness or from both? In any event, the Ugandan troops that are currently stationed in Congo must move to that region, because they only have other intentions in Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">There is total anarchy in northern Uganda, and the ‘Lord's Army’ does everything that God forbids. It is inconceivable that these incredible villains can continue to descend on schools and kidnap women and children in order to turn them into sex slaves or forced soldiers. Prisoners are forced to kill or torture one another if they try to escape. For far too long now, the international community has been standing idly by; the atrocities simply carry on without hindrance. The African Union is losing face by doing nothing, and it is high time that the Security Council got involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Sudan has announced it will no longer provide aid to the ‘Lord's Army’, but my group is not at all convinced that Sudan will keep its word. To top it all, the threat of war with Rwanda hangs over the region. How does the Commission assess this threat of war?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is the question of what the European Union is prepared to do to protect the population there and provide humanitarian aid. It is high time that the appalling rule of the ‘Lord's Army’ was brought to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When one sees all that is perpetrated by the loathsome armed sect which calls itself the 'Lord's Army', one is inclined to think that the Ugandan army had enough work to do when it comes to guaranteeing peace and security in its own country, without sowing discord and strife in neighbouring countries, where it intervenes to promote the interests of the great powers, economic and tribal interests, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, lamentable that, even if the Ugandan army were to concentrate on Uganda, that would not resolve the problem, as the Ugandan army and government are part of the problem rather than a means of dealing with it. That is why we need a clear-cut policy here. We must first see to it that the Sudanese attacks on Uganda, along with other interventions by outsiders, are stopped; then, secondly, we also have to get the Ugandans to put a stop to their own incursions into neighbouring countries; thirdly, Uganda needs to make a start on using the police and armed forces, under the rule of law, to do away with the criminal elements, a process that must go hand in hand with a process of reconciliation and negotiation, leading progressively to the setting up in Uganda of something like genuine democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This country has had much to endure under various dictators, through several wars, and at the hands of diverse criminal elements. It is vitally necessary to restore the precarious balance between the tribes and ethnic groups of this country, whose diversity is known to us from the days of the Kingdom of Buganda under the Kabaka, which also includes many, many other ancient kingdoms and tribes and will have a democratic future only on the basis of the rule of law and if the balance of races and ethnic groups is carefully maintained.</p>

First of all it says that the LRA has a complex political agenda. The agenda is one insane man pretending to receive messages from the Holy Spirit that he should rule Uganda according to the Ten Commandments. Since this agenda has no public appeal, Kony abducts children to lead his war. He has no intention whatever of negotiating with anyone about a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to stop the atrocities is to make sure that Kony has no way of receiving arms. Nevertheless it is a fact that the Sudanese commander has supplied Kony with massive amounts of arms, which has enabled him to carry out the recent abductions. Even if the Sudanese Government has no part in this, it is responsible for its army's actions. I therefore urge Sudan to ensure that none of Sudan's armed forces will ever again be able to arm the LRA and bring about the unspeakable suffering of thousands of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is therefore pleased with Parliament's initiative to expose the suffering of the people of that region.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with Parliament that we must condemn the campaign of terror being carried out by the Lord's Resistance Army, with its murders and kidnappings. The lack of security created by its activity is a significant obstacle to humanitarian aid, since it restricts access and endangers both the humanitarian aid workers and the civilian population, in addition to all the other problems you have pointed out very effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">You have raised the issue of what the Union is doing. At the moment the Union is providing significant humanitarian assistance and support, by means of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), in so far as the security measures allow it. The assistance is being provided in the form of health care and food support, increasing the availability of drinking water and improving the sanitation system, providing seed and tools, in order to guarantee food security, and distributing basic necessities such as shelters and blankets. This week, the Director of ECHO has been in the area participating in the tasks of increasing our resources, in order to deal with the current needs, and the assistance we are providing this year will be equivalent to EUR 4 million, double that of last year, and it will be increased by a further 2 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing aid is clearly not everything, however. We will also have to see to what extent this aid can be used as a lever for achieving other results. The main donor countries are holding a dialogue with the Ugandan Government in order to promote a policy in the north to facilitate the full integration of the northern districts into the rest of the country. The Commission's delegation is chairing the group of donors which is studying the problems affecting the northern region and, especially, trying to resolve the problem of the children.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally using the lever of financial resources to make progress in the right direction. The first tranche of budgetary aid, from the Eighth European Development Fund (EDF), was released once the condition not to spend more than 2% of the total budget for military purposes was fulfilled, and the decision to release further tranches will depend on what agreement can be reached with the government of Uganda on the appropriate conditions for its use.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is preparing, together with the government, a programme for the rehabilitation of the north, a particularly difficult area. We believe that the difference in standard of living between the north and the rest of the country is one of the fundamental causes, as well as the consequence, of the persistent instability and insecurity. However, we believe that, if we had other external support, our actions would be much more effective. The Commission would therefore be very glad to see greater involvement by the African Union in the efforts to find a lasting solution to the problem, which would then allow us to deal with the problems faced in other areas which you have referred to in your speeches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
