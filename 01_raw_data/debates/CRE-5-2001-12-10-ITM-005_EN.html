<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niebler (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission for its excellent and constructive involvement in the consultation on this telecommunications package. I would also like to sincerely thank the Belgian Presidency, which has shown enormous commitment in its efforts to facilitate a compromise between the Council and Parliament, and I think that if we are able to reach agreement on Wednesday, and I very much hope we will, it will be entirely due to the excellent way in which the Belgian Presidency has handled the negotiations. Thank you very much indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also, of course, owe very special thanks to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who have not only co-operated in such an outstanding way over a period of many months, but have also worked together on the compromises so constructively. Over the last 12 years, the EU has achieved an enormous amount in the telecommunications market. The monopolies of the established service providers have been broken, and there has been complete liberalisation and deregulation of the market in many areas, which has benefited both consumers and the economy in general. One clear result of all this has been a fall in prices and a variety of new products and services from the various providers. But there is, of course, nothing that cannot be improved further. This was evident from the 1999 telecommunications report and from the seventh implementation report recently published by the Commission. I would just like to mention a couple of key concepts: local loop unbundling for the benefit of alternative service providers, where further action is still needed in the Member States, and the subscriber's link to the network, which is still unsatisfactory in some Member States. Some established service providers are still offering dumping prices and there are also still bottlenecks as regards leased lines. The new legal framework for telecommunications regulation should guarantee some remedial action here. I would first like to briefly present my two reports on the telecommunications package and I would then like to turn to two other critical points regarding the other directives.</p>
<p class="contents">First, then, the Authorisation Directive. The whole point of the Authorisation Directive is to harmonise authorisation arrangements in the Member States. I would like to stress once again, as I said at first reading, that the Commission has produced some excellent proposals here, proposals that I welcomed at first reading and which I specifically wish to support at second reading also. Up to now there have not been uniform procedures for operating communications networks and providing communications services. There have been a variety of different conditions, including, in particular, varying obligations on providers to supply information, there have been variations in the length of the procedures, and the cost and substance of the authorisations has varied. This situation will come to an end with the new Authorisation Directive. The directive also envisages a step change in the authorisation system. Up to now, it has been the practice to issue individual authorisations, but when the Authorisation Directive comes in, there will be a switch to general authorisations, that is to say that, in future, communications network operators will not have to obtain an official licence beforehand, but will only have to demonstrate that they intend to operate a network. However, they will have to comply with the requirements of the general authorisation scheme or of the directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Obligations on providers, particularly those regarding information, will be simplified by the new directive, with requirements being limited to the essential. So we are talking about a very provider-friendly solution here. One of this Parliament's achievements has been the introduction of greater transparency in the granting of rights of way, for example drawing up a register setting out the procedures for granting rights of way in the Member States, and we have also managed to ensure that legal protection against rulings on rights of ways is guaranteed in all Member States. We would have like to have achieved even more, especially as regards costs. In this case, Parliament stressed the importance of providers, if at all possible, not being burdened with excessive costs in future, if I may put it that way, with regard to rights of way, numbers, the granting of licences and frequencies. As far as this issue is concerned, our discussions have not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">Should it be necessary to reach a compromise on the whole package, Parliament will surrender its own position in favour of the Council's recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second report is on the Radio Spectrum Decision. The essential objective of this decision is to involve the Commission more closely in the granting of frequencies in future, which is how it should be. Radio frequencies are sought-after commodities, and frequency allocation involves taking highly political decisions, and we must accordingly ensure that the decision makers who bear political responsibility are involved. The granting of frequencies, frequency assignment and frequency allocation are no longer just a technical matter, nowadays, but a real political game.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points on which the Council and Parliament are not yet totally in agreement, and I am therefore particularly pleased to see Mr Daems, the President-in-Office of the Council, here in the Chamber today. Perhaps he could say something about the two points which I am particularly concerned about later on in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">One point which Parliament has tackled repeatedly is whether it should itself be involved in future decisions on radio spectrum policy. This House had requested that whenever frequency reallocation, in particular, was at stake, Parliament should, through the codecision procedure, be consulted and involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we also adopted an amendment in committee at second reading that would guarantee us this right in a binding article contained in the directive, in the decision. Now, the Council only wants to include this article or this proposal as a recital in the decision. I would therefore like to ask Mr Daems to consider once more, if we are agreed on this, that Parliament should also be involved in radio spectrum policy via the codecision procedure, in which case we could be included in the decision itself and not just mentioned in a recital.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the extent to which the Commission should be concerned with the granting of frequencies. Parliament requested that in the case of frequencies with Community coverage, the Commission should be called upon to intervene or put forward proposals. In the decision, or rather in the Belgian Presidency proposal that I now have before me, I see that by deleting two little words in Amendment No 1, that is to say ‘in particular’, the decision-making power is in fact to be considerably extended. So I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in this case, too, if he could consider whether we could not agree to delete those two little words, which would mean that we would be respecting the principle of subsidiarity and thus achieving a solution between the Council and Parliament. I find it hard to believe that the Council could not accept this too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to touch on two other points, concerning the framework directive and the Universal Service Directive. First of all, I absolutely must thank the Belgian Presidency very sincerely once again. The Belgian Presidency has worked out an excellent compromise for Article 6. This is about who will have power of decision in future when there are questions about telecommunications law – the Commission or the Member States. I believe that this House can accept the compromise that has emerged. Many Members would have liked us to go further in this area, but that was just not achievable. However, the compromise that has now emerged, according to which the Commission can intervene in matters of competition law, and in particular in matters of market definition and with regard to what constitutes significant market power, is, I believe, a very fair one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to a point that I regard as particularly significant, and then I shall conclude. We have been concerned for many years as to how we can promote digital television still further in Europe. The amended proposals from the Belgian Presidency have been one of the greatest disappointments in all this, so that we will achieve nothing or very little in this area. Two points have emerged. The first is whether we can extend transmission obligations to APIs and IPGs. This Parliament unanimously advocated this in all the negotiations. I would ask, once again, that great thought should be given to this or that the Commission should consider how we can achieve this. Furthermore, on the subject of a commonly agreed standard for digital television in the European Union, I believe that we need to go further than the Belgian Presidency has indicated so far. Perhaps the Commission could give a clear signal here, too, in order to help digital television to make a genuine breakthrough in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paasilinna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="italic"> (FI)</span> Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, my colleagues, Europe's greatest change is, of course, the networking which has taken place; this certainly unifies us Europeans more than a common currency. It is of everyday and full-time significance, and its importance is growing all the time. The core philosophy of the entire grand project for an electronic Europe is that the digital divide should not take hold in Europe in the way that it threatens to take hold in many other parts of the world; and we, as well as Parliament, the Council and the Commission all share a common line here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's draft framework directive and the other statutes belonging to this telecoms package follow the correct line and are very balanced, and I am highly satisfied with them. In this rapidly-moving period of change, we will make up for lost ground; and particular attention has been paid to the importance of convergence, of rapprochement. This means that, to an ever increasing extent, the same content can be prepared on the same hardware, be transferred along the same routes and be received on the same apparatus. This creates a wholly new information space, or perhaps I should say information world, since this is a part of us, it is a part of us in the workplace, at home and when we are travelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, in Parliament, we desire that this world be regulated, but that at the same time competition be secured, so that no monopolies, duopolies or cartels are generated. This will maintain a low pricing level, easy access, and employment and growth in this area. I could venture to say that if we had had these regulations in force at the time when we decided on the ‘electronic Europe’ at Lisbon and when (at the same time) the auction in frequencies was initiated, then it would not have been possible for the catastrophe of the frequency auctions to unfold in the way that it did. It would have been possible to standardise the bid auctions and to harmonise practice, and consequently such irregularities would not have taken place, the sector would not have been driven to its knees and we would have saved many hundreds from bankruptcies and the unfortunate unemployment consequences linked to these.</p>
<p class="contents">A telecoms package which consolidates the Union's telecommunication legislation will have great significance in competition with others outside the European Union. It will result in us having more harmonised markets for this sector which in itself is already international and border-transcending. We will then also obtain the benefit of the European Union's advantages of scale, which in turn will surely have an impact on both employment and on the success possibilities of firms and on pricing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these five statutes, I regard the framework directive to be the most important. The most difficult matters have been dealt with here. Now we have before us my draft report which has been processed by the committee, for which I thank my colleagues (it was approved unanimously), and then also the presentation of the Presidency State. It has gone far in order to meet Parliament half way, and in my opinion we should approve it. It takes account of Parliament's stance in two central matters which we have been taking up for discussion throughout this summer and autumn: Article 6 and Article 4. The latter concerns the appeals procedure and the former concerns the relationship between the Commission and the national regulatory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the first time, and this can be regarded as a breakthrough, the Commission can intervene in a national statute, if this statute is not in harmony with the general statutes, both in the definition of the market and in the definition of a significant market position. These are the two matters which we wanted to see implemented, and now, thanks to the Presidency State, they are in your proposal. Furthermore, I hope that the Presidency State can tell us whether it is also possible that the Council may commit to this as well. If this is so, then this package should in my opinion be approved. I have been given to understand that the Commission is also of this view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brunetta (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner Liikanen, the new regulatory framework for telecommunications replaces the Community system which opened up the national markets in Europe and brought the era of monopolies to a close. By way of justifying the revision of the Community telecommunications framework, the European Commission stated its intention to reduce the regulatory burdens according to the liberalisation objectives achieved on the basis of the model still in force. The aim was, in fact, to secure greater confidence in market forces in order to boost the competitiveness of the European market and encourage investment in the emerging markets, facilitating the provision of innovative services. The purpose of the revision of the prevailing model should, therefore, have the aim of gradually moving the telecommunications market on from its liberalisation phase to a phase of genuine, consolidated competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between the development of the regulatory framework and the dynamics of the markets should be pursued using a forward-looking approach which favours competitive conditions, ensuring the rapid distribution of innovative services, in order to provide direction for the market and the future exclusive application of the procurement rules which are gradually replacing <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> rules. The new model should introduce a transitional phase that fosters this transition to a telecommunications market that can be managed in the same way as any other economic sector in strict respect for competition rules. This end can be achieved by a body of <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> rules harmonised at European level which are characterised by the fact that they are temporary and exceptional; in other words, the regulation that we are discussing and approving <span class="italic">ex ante</span> must provide for it to be abolished when a sufficient level of competition has been achieved. These <span class="italic">ex ante</span> rules must be kept to a minimum as regards requirements and strength, in order to ensure that intervention is proportionate to the regulatory objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the flexibility of the new model, which very prudently extends the scope of intervention of the international regulatory authorities, the main thrust of the new regulatory framework must be the need to guarantee the supervisory power that the Commission has laid down in respect of the national authorities, in order to ensure correct interpretation of the new framework and thereby avoid distortion of the competitiveness of the European market between geographical areas. In fact, with the absence of a centralised authority at European level making it possible to assess the ultimate consistency of national decisions with Community objectives, the new regulatory framework is in danger of not achieving its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen, allow me to illustrate an amendment which I tabled together with 51 Members from different political groups precisely to Mr Paasilinna’s directive. Mr Paasilinna has worked very hard on his proposal on the framework directive on telecommunications. This amendment seeks to make things clearer for operators, to avoid fragmentation in the application of Community law in the various Member States and to ensure the development of a genuine internal telecommunications market. The adoption of my proposal would facilitate harmonisation, which can only be achieved by establishing unambiguously defined power allowing the European Commission to intervene to guarantee that the application of Community law is coherent with objectives and pursues the same goals in all the Member States. Harmonisation and centralised power are the basis for the development of the pan-European telecommunications market. This what the operators want, this is what the market wants, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen. The market wants the development of a pan-European telecommunications market, whereas the short-sightedness of the national authorities often tends to slow down that process of development in this phase; that is why I tabled this amendment which, I hope, will be taken into due consideration by the Belgian Presidency, the Council, the Commission and this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, in the concluding part of this package of directives, the universal service and users' rights directive, for which I have been privileged to be rapporteur, are very much at the cutting edge of the whole package. These are things that will really mean something to all consumers and users of electronic communication services. The common position that we received from the Council was a major advance over the first reading text and I would like to thank the Council and Commission for accepting so many of Parliament's ideas and suggestions. The new text has been substantially restructured and clarified which is important for effective transposal in Member States. As part of that restructuring, the aspects of market intervention contained in this directive – and this is very strong market intervention at a retail price level – are clearly set out. It is worth reminding all of us in this House that these are very much seen as transitional measures towards a fully open market in which competition rules will reign supreme. That is the direction we want to move in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pick up on some further enhancements that we have made as a result of the second reading. I would like to thank the Council for working so closely with us and also to thank my colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who worked very closely with me in making suggestions. I hope that they will be pleased with the results that we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth reminding ourselves that the whole essence of this universal service directive is to ensure that a core service is available to both able-bodied and disabled consumers across the single market, and also that the users' rights provisions must ensure that consumers have a right to clear contract terms, to comprehensive transparent pricing information and also a guarantee of other important services. The changes that we have particularly focused on at second reading concern some further important enhancements to the provision for disabled users.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that at the common position stage, we have a clear indication in a separate article about the importance of Member States providing for disabled users on a wide range of services, in particular ensuring that disabled users have the sort of choice and range of services that all other consumers expect. Those are broad-ranging provisions that will develop as services expand.</p>
<p class="contents">The new area – that I am pleased we have introduced, and I would like to thank the Council for accepting this – is to encourage the development of clear quality standards related to disabled user provision. That is something that we have added in at this stage because it seemed to us that it was all very well having some common provisions but unless we have a way of monitoring those and making sure that those evolve with the rest of the range of services involved, then things might just stand still. We will not see disabled users being able to take advantage of new technology and new services in the way we would like them to. This is a very important provision which I am sure will have the support of all colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area that we focused on in second reading was to ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises also benefit from the sort of users' rights that are required for individual consumers. In a rapidly developing world, we already know that small- and medium-sized enterprises are a key target for enhanced electronic communications. We want SMEs to really buy into e-commerce, into the new possibilities afforded to them by enhanced electronic communications. They do not necessarily have the negotiating power of larger companies and therefore provision is made for them.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to talk about a third aspect which has involved us in a lot of tough negotiation with the Council, namely over "must carry" obligations which are included within this Directive. These allow Member States to impose obligations to carry public service channels and channels of specific interest on electronic communication systems. Many colleagues felt that there should be a specific extension of this to satellite and conditional access systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and Commission have told us that this is already covered fully in the access and interconnection directive, but colleagues have not agreed with that. When it comes to the compromise package that we will vote on I am prepared to recommend to colleagues that we do not support this area but on condition that the Commission assures us that it will continue to keep this under very close scrutiny when it comes to looking at the Television without Frontiers directive and also to encourage the fair access provisions. If we do that, I am sure that we can move forward to approve the whole package in what will be a major advance for the European economy and for Europe's competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daems,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, in turn, to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for the work they have carried out in tandem with the presidency, in the search for a common platform on the basis of which we can reach agreement. This will allow us to take a reasonably prompt decision at long last, thus promoting the development of the entire telecom sector, and hence the development of the internal market. I should also like to include the Commission in my thanks, which, together with the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, helped us in every way possible to reach a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to outline the process we went through. By process, I mean the procedure we followed to reach a package which is hopefully acceptable to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You have to bear in mind that it is not easy to reconcile very different opinions, especially where Member States are concerned, in order to be able to produce a package at the end of it. It is therefore in this context that the response, prepared by the presidency, to the recommendations for second reading concerning the directives which are now before us, can, in fact, be seen as a very balanced response, which in the view of the presidency might be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, a number of additional explanatory statements will have to be drafted, for it is impossible to include everything in the body of a directive, for example with regard to comments by the first rapporteur, Mrs Niebler. In my view, it is indeed self-evident that a new policy requires information and involvement by, for example, Parliament, certainly when it comes to the use of the existing spectrum. Despite this, I believe that this general principle will necessitate a clarification from the party applying it, namely the Commission, and I therefore also believe that explanatory statements by the Commission, not simply on this score but also on a number of other aspects, could prove useful, as a number of rapporteurs have already stated.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe my present role to be as follows: if you, as Parliament, could ensure that this common response by the Council’s presidency will be accepted by you, then this is what will actually happen in practice. In other words, it is, in my opinion, very important to me that I can officially say to you that, if the Commission can indeed fully support our response and if Parliament can fully accept this common position of the Council, the Council will accept this accordingly. In other words, it is a package, as was stated a moment ago. A package entails the risk that if you tug at one string of the package, the whole thing may fall apart. I am not saying this because I like saying this, but because political realism, with which we are all familiar, teaches us that, if we want to proceed swiftly, we need to adopt a common position which offers a huge amount of benefits. Let us be honest, the Council’s flexibility towards Parliament has been exemplary, and contained a crucial message which was news to me, namely that the concept of the internal market is clearly being prioritised, even by the Council. If you ask me, this is a very special new message.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that the response of the Council’s presidency is being presented to you here, and I would not like to see my colleagues who have asked me to tell you this, revisiting their previous common position by running a risk and tugging at a string – and I am saying this in all candour – for I then believe that we would be at a complete loss as to know where we would end up in some future procedure or other.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we have now reached a point where we can make enormous headway, where the Council’s flexibility is, I dare say, rather exemplary, where we stimulate industry, where we contribute towards establishing the internal market and, via the internal market, create advantages for the consumer in all its diversity and with all its aspects, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, via universal service, which we all set so much store by. In other words, the Council gives you the formal pledge that, if the Commission supports this fully, and if you deem this package to be acceptable, the Council will actually implement this package without any exception. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the President-in-Office for his straight-forward language, for he is simply saying ‘take it or leave it’. But first and foremost, I admire his enormous perseverance, particularly in the light of the fact that we have arrived at this result.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that one important sentence in the speech of the President-in-Office stood out for me, namely the emphasis he placed on the internal market. Unfortunately, we have had to work for too long with a Council that no longer appeared to embrace the concept of internal market. Thanks to you, and I should say, thanks to many of my fellow MEPs here in the European Parliament, this has now been rectified, fortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, what is at issue is that we will face more competition, more players, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, etc., and there is nothing wrong with that, of course. It is about striking a fine balance between rules on the one hand, and scope for further market development on the other. We are in this transitional phase, and we must aim for normality as quickly as possible, away from ex ante, towards ex post, to put it in simple terms. This means, therefore, that we must weigh up the whole set of rules and market interventions against the question as to whether this is really future-proof. In my opinion, this will need to be one of the assessment criteria for the Commission, to constantly monitor whether we could proceed any faster towards what I refer to as a more normal market, ex post, in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">This also naturally leads on to the question: what will the consumer gain from this? Will we receive more service and lower prices, in particular? I am therefore pleased with the Council’s compromise proposal with regard to international roaming, and I would ask the Commissioner now: what steps will the Commission take in order to ensure that next year, during the summer holidays, we will not be inundated with complaints by our voters that it is still very expensive, that the cost of ringing from a landline to a mobile line is still too high. These are the questions which are important to our citizens, and we must simply get results on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 6 has been mentioned many times. One can appreciate it at different levels. I am pleased that the Council eventually took the bull by the horns and has stated that an internal market requires an independent role by the Commission. We will continue to fight in the next round, because what you are now offering is too little in my opinion, and more is needed for an internal market, but also on that score, we must of course establish a certain kind of realism. As I understand it, you have on that basis, in fact, interpreted the revision clause along the lines of ‘move towards this single internal market’. Although you have not adopted Amendment No 36, you have done so at a practical level, and I am extremely grateful to you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in my view, it is very important for us to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take with regard to digital television, so as to be able to lay down this one European standard as soon as possible. This is about Europe’s future, about achieving the objective of Lisbon, and I believe that the Commission now also has a key role to play in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Daems, you quite rightly pointed out that you have achieved a great deal in the Council and you also referred to the flexibility on the part of the Council that this involved. You said that we have reached a good compromise. I agree, and I think that many of my colleagues in my group will see it the same way. It is an acceptable compromise. There are a good many points on which further negotiation is needed. Mr van Velzen hit the right note. We will have to carry on negotiating and fighting to achieve a common internal market, because this is just one step and further work will be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we in this House have one particular problem with this, and I have already heard a lot of people saying that it is difficult to have an informal trialogue as part of the second reading. That requires a great deal of work and needs a huge investment of time given all the linguistic difficulties involved. The whole package that we have before us is very complicated and needs a great deal of detailed work. I think that we here in Parliament – and I am addressing this comment more to Parliament than to the Commission and the Council, although it indirectly affects them too of course – will have to make a greater investment in ensuring that we have whatever support is required to tackle such a complex task from a political point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">This will still not guarantee completion of the internal market. It is right that in future the Commission will have more power and scope for action. We have not used the word ‘veto’. That is probably very clever in political terms, but nevertheless it is something along those lines. Nevertheless, by means of cooperation and consultation, the national regulatory authorities have the power to ensure that they can take appropriate action to influence their national markets. There is an interesting definition of transnational markets. Nevertheless, there are two further problems to which previous speakers have referred regarding the interoperability of standards. I believe that the proposal does not go far enough in this respect. I cannot understand our countries, why they are not in favour of interoperability in the area of standards. I hope that something more will emerge in this field. There is also still a great deal more to be achieved, via consultation with Parliament, as regards Parliament's participation concerning technical measures, and that includes, in particular, Mrs Niebler's report, for which I am shadow rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply venture to point out that Mr von Wogau will, I hope, be bringing forward an interesting report next year dealing more fully with the issue of Parliament's participation in such consultation processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Once more, we have until Wednesday to consider things further, and the Council and the Commission have a further opportunity to comment on these points. I would be delighted if they would do that today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, I would naturally like to echo the words of praise expressed by my fellow MEPs for Mr Daems for all his efforts, to which Mrs Marcel has also greatly contributed, of course. I will return to this in a moment, for I would also like to thank all my fellow MEPs, and especially the rapporteurs, for the pleasant and close working relationship so far. For we must realise that what is before us was only possible thanks to the unanimity with which we in this Parliament have worked on this package. It was, of course, abundantly clear to the Council that we were not going to yield an inch on essential points, especially on the score that we want one internal market where companies and consumers can benefit from the achievements of that one Europe. And we can only achieve this in this way. That is why it is crucial for us to agree on sound procedures that are ultimately monitored by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What I miss in the Council’s package before us, is a clear stand on one European standard for digital interactive television, something which my group deeply regrets. What is clear is that Europe does not seem to be learning from past experience. Indeed, the overwhelming success of the mobile phone standard, from which consumers and companies have benefited and will do so in future, apparently failed to convince the Council enough to dare adopt a clear stand for once, namely in the field of digital television. I would therefore ask Commissioner Liikaanen whether he, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mr Bangemann, would be prepared to do this and would like to promote the MHP platform. I would ask him at the same time to present a clear timeframe for this.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have understood by now that the package that is before us, this compromise, is acceptable to my group, and I only hope that Mr Daems is prepared to confirm this. For then it will be implemented to the letter of the law in <span class="italic">all</span> Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of the previous speakers, and above all you, Mr President-in-Office, were right in saying that we need to see all this in the light of the e-Europe initiative and of the internal market. I would like to express my appreciation of your efforts not only personally, but also on behalf of my group, and I know that sometimes things get sorted out in the corridor, over a coffee or in other informal ways, over a sumptuous meal, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to tell you that I have a bit of stomach ache. Not because I have spent so much time recently with lobbyists from one side or another over sumptuous dinners, but because depending on how you look at it, what is on offer is either too much or too little. Too much in the sense mentioned by Mr van Velzen: ‘eat up, that is all you are getting’, or too little in as much as when we reach compromises we have to accept proposals from the European Parliament being slightly amended, with small, nebulous changes involving little words like ‘shall’ and ‘may’, which are then taken out, so that I suddenly feel that the amendments are not so minor any more.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly pick out one point, as I had an excellent exchange of information throughout the whole period of cooperation with Mr Harbour. I would like to highlight just one point in the context of the Universal Service Directive, and that concerns consumers with disabilities. We are not giving anything away here. We live in a society which for reasons of solidarity and on economic grounds takes whatever steps need to be taken. What is at stake here is that after many years we are giving some very important signals in this area, in order to give people with disabilities full access to the information and communication society as fully integrated consumers. This political willingness, this political awareness and this political will would simply not have existed to the same extent 20 years ago. I just wanted to mention that point to demonstrate to you all that time is a great healer. However, that will certainly not cure my stomach ache.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that because of this stomach ache I would very gladly vote for this compromise, because, just like all of you, I am in favour of this internal market, and I would have been happier if it had already been established now, not at some point in the near future. However, I too will close by mentioning the crucial points that other Members have already touched upon, and which I do not really think are solved in the compromise: interoperability, digital television, transmission obligations, and Article 6 of the framework directive. Whether this fare is too much or too little, I think it takes us forward an inch or two. I would be very interested to hear what else you may have to say to us, and then, even if it upsets my stomach, we would be happy to say ‘yes’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look at what the Council agreed upon in Lisbon and the new European initiative in particular and consider utilising the advantages which would accrue to Europe from the telecommunications revolution, we can see that there are many great opportunities out there to be grasped, but they require proper order, proper rules and proper regulation to ensure their use for the benefit of all. At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century. I suppose it is appropriate that a man of his origins should be doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular, I want to deal with two aspects. First there is the universal service aspect – the universal obligation that my colleague Malcolm Harbour was talking about. I will take a slightly different perspective. There is a risk relating to competition, with new regulations and new rules being brought in, that there will be cherry-picking of the most valuable markets, the most valuable layers, and suddenly larger urban areas will benefit whilst rural areas and peripheral areas will lose out.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, as already mentioned by Malcolm Harbour, there is the question of disabled access. Companies and institutions must be forced to adapt their services to suit the needs of the consumers and particularly those consumers to whom the Internet and the telecommunications revolution could open the most possibilities of all by bringing them into the real world and bringing them into dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">A third area that I wish to focus on is the risk of creating new illiterates or new gaps between those people who have computer and electronic skills and those who do not. We have a population in Europe today that is ageing: we have a huge middle-aged and ageing population that may not have the training and the skills necessary to usefully adapt to computers, electronic commerce and so on. What is happening in our schools and providing access in education is very important, but we must look to new ways of bringing in the middle-aged and the aged into the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the eSchola initiative is a great one. – I hope it can be extended to bring in older people and more peripheral areas. My last point is that, when we speak about consumers, let us ensure that we speak about all of the consumers of Europe not just those in the largest urban areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I feel that no one, including the Commission, should be under any illusion that this raft of proposals, although a substantial step in the right direction, might represent a positive, definitive solution. I do not feel this will be the case; indeed, the fate of the regulation on unbundling the local loop, despite its almost unanimous adoption, and the difficulties encountered in its implementation bear witness to this.</p>
<p class="contents">An underlying contradiction still remains in many Member States, specifically in those where publicly controlled telecommunications companies are still very influential and where, as a result, the State finds itself acting as both player and referee at the same time. There is a great conflict of interests within most public administrations which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest barriers to the process of liberalising the telecommunications sector. In order to alleviate the negative effects of the present imbalances in the different national markets, it might be appropriate to confer upon the Commission greater power to monitor and guide the national regulatory authorities, and to create mechanisms for cooperation and coordination between the national authorities. That is why the Italian Radicals will support Mr Brunetta’s amendment. Although not the final solution, it could be an appropriate path to take.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want an open, competitive, effective telecommunications market, we need to fulfil an essential requirement, and that is to reduce the States’ power as managers in the telecommunications sector. The State and the administrations must play a single role: the role they need to play of regulators. Playing two roles, being both players and referees at the same time, slows everything down and places the success of the liberalisation process in jeopardy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But are we moving fast enough to keep up with a changing market?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate colleagues, especially the PPE-ED team, for getting to this point where much of Parliament's position has been taken on board in the Council text. I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue, not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly, has been accepted. This gives some comfort to operators and provides a more balanced situation. I also welcome moves improving Article 6 of that directive so as to achieve a more even regulatory framework across Member States through the requirement for cooperation and coordination between NRAs and the Commission. Personally, I prefer the voluntary approach to adopting common standards in digital television technology rather than seeking to impose one solution. I say, let the market provide the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The package, as now formulated, seems a big improvement on the original proposal but we are still looking for consumers' concern about levels of competition and service to be addressed through faster transition to a true internal market governed by general competition rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, his efforts to achieve a consensus have led to the Socialist Group's amendments – both to strengthen the 'must carry' provisions and to give stronger rights of access to disabled users – being carried in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">The fast pace of technological change in the telecoms sector means that legislation must keep up with the pace of developments. But it must reflect growing expectations of users and consumers for a minimum set of services at an affordable price, guaranteeing access for all. The telecoms revolution has created a rise in consumer expectations. It is our job to respond and ensure that our legislative framework in the EU can deliver competition and consumer benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers, for example, have not benefited from the existence of multiple competitors in the mobile phone market. Tariffs have not fallen in line with lower costs of running networks, now prompting in the UK an Oftel inquiry and a European Commission investigation. This directive must ensure genuine universal access and extend to all users, especially those with special social needs, those on low incomes and those with disabilities. The disabled will be excluded from the opportunities if there are not sufficient guarantees of access across Europe to public payphones, directory services and electronic programme options. In my country alone, two million blind and partially-sighted people could benefit from this directive if the Council and the Commission accept our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on 'must carry' provisions, we need to find a means to allow services and channels in the public interest to be carried on cable and satellite platforms. If we do not, then I fear the future of satellite television might be dominated by the TV culture of quiz shows featuring stripping housewives, squeezing out educational and public interest programmes. Let us be clear: Amendment No 26 does not promote a free ride for public broadcasters on conditional access services nor indeed on imposing or mandating this. The fact is that market conditions do not always provide 'must carry'. It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so. I trust the Commission and the Council will see the merits of supporting this.</p>
<p class="contents">We favour a quick deal but it is conditional on the Council and the Commission accepting our amendments, which are a genuine and committed attempt to ensure that the brave new world of electronic communications is genuinely universal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a good reason why we should try to achieve something in this area, in contrast to what has sometimes happened with regard to other decisions about liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, with whom I have worked closely. I want to agree with those speakers who have said that we are now introducing important rules for disabled users. In certain contexts, I have felt ashamed at the fact that our rules have not been as advanced as the rules in other large markets. I also want to emphasise what Mr Harbour said about the ‘must carry’ principle. The intensity with which we have debated TV issues in recent weeks shows that it is not entirely acceptable to distinguish between content and the principles we had when we first debated convergences. We are talking here about important cultural values in respect of which the Commission and the Member States must be able to depart even from strictly commercial rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support the compromise in the Paasilinna report. In that context, I also hope that the Commission will apply a fairer competition policy between large and small countries than that we have seen, so that small and different markets too can continue to exist. That is something to which perhaps not enough attention has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the issue of digital TV, I really regret the Council’s position on API for digital receivers. In many contexts, the European Parliament has clearly given its backing to an open common and approved standard. In this area, there is no market, as on many other issues. The market cannot therefore be researched. I hope that, before we vote on Wednesday, the Commission will be able to say when it is intended to take measures to bring about interoperability and genuine freedom of choice for consumers, and what it is intended that these measures should be. I therefore hope that the Commission will be able to come up with a declaration before we vote on Wednesday. That is important for this sector’s competitiveness in relation to other sectors within the telecommunications sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to their commitment, they have achieved considerable progress in the EU's telecommunications market. However, in contrast to what the word suggests, the term telecommunications market represents something that has not been dealt with properly, particularly in the Council common position we have before us. What I have in mind is digital television. I very much welcome the fact that not only the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose views I am conveying here, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have unanimously indicated that it is simply not enough for us just to talk about attempting to avoid the danger of a digital divide in the European Union. I am not talking about access for people with disabilities, an area in which I think significant progress has been made. I am talking about the principle of digital access for all, and also about the interoperability of equipment, application interfaces and services.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much I regret this, whilst praising the Belgian Presidency for everything else it has achieved, but this is the drawback of this outcome: the course is now being set for equal access via a common standard for digital television, and we naturally need to strike a balance between developing the market and public interest obligations, and these two points of view have been taken into account by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in their opinions. That is why I am urgently appealing to the Council, in view of this need to take cultural considerations into account, to ensure equal access for all. I call on you to improve this part of the text, and we will then all be able to give it our unqualified support.</p>

I belong to the minority who, at first reading, were not satisfied with Article 6 of the framework directive. The compromise that has now been presented meets with my approval. I think a balance has been achieved between the national regulators' shadowing of the market and the Commission's right of veto, in order to stimulate the progress of the internal market, of which we are all in favour, even my group. This represents, in our view, very much another fragmentation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something general about the modus operandi itself. Yes, we are dealing with a very fast-moving market and rapidly evolving technology, and we have tried to take that into account by acting relatively speedily. I want, though, just to say another word of admonition. Parliament – by which I mean, we – should not always deny ourselves our rights in the legislative process. We realise that from time to time, when the worst comes to the worst, but I think it must remain an exception.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight another point. Mrs Hieronymi made it very clear – and, as a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I can only underline what she said – that a unitary standard for digital television, and its interoperability, are issues not only for industry policy, but also for consumers. I have promised consumers and the general public in my constituency that we would ensure that there was a standard that would enable them to receive on one TV set everything that they wanted to see and that they would not have to install several sets. I believe we have to go a bit further down that road. I would like to emphasise the very demand that Mrs Hieronymi made when she spoke just now. Perhaps the Commission and the Council can leap a bit further over the shadow thrown by digital television and reach a compromise. Then I, too, would find it easier to vote in favour of the package as a whole. I will end my speech there and point out that I have stuck to the speaking time allotted to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much of the process was kick-started and propelled by the declarations at the Lisbon Summit, but nothing would have happened if those declaratory statements had not been turned into excellent and workable proposals by the Commission. They were then propelled forward by some superb cross-party work by rapporteurs in this Parliament and fixed as a result of innovative negotiating skills on the part of the Belgian presidency and from Mr Daems – who contrived to include a gastronomic tour of Brussels in his valiant efforts to secure consensus. This combination was successful in dragging Member States and national regulatory authorities – some of them kicking and screaming – towards a workable pan-European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That seems to me to offer some lessons for the Barcelona Summit next year: if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others, we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested Community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the Council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need sensible compromises, and we need them in quick order. This is a very fast-moving market, and so we need fast decision-making processes that produce binding rulings and, above all, more legal security as well. It is on that basis that there will be long-term investment, which is what we need in the current economic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just remind you that there are, at present, eighty cases pending in Austria alone, of which only two were decided by the Supreme Court. This can hardly be the way into the future. As I see it, the authorisation directive is about harmonisation being a very positive thing, but also at the same time about the need to guarantee rights of access. It must be possible for the authorities to be helpful in implementing these rights if one is paying for it. In the access directive, the open interface is of particular importance. The independence of the alternative operators, and especially of the interface, is something that we should not underestimate in the future. The possibility of future dynamic development in this area is of the utmost importance to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards universal service, we need clear definitions of universal service provisions, especially with respect to what has to be financed by the operator and what by the State; and finance by the State raises the question of whether there is to be a public invitation to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these liberalisation measures are of quite particular importance to the public – in both the internal and domestic markets.

Others have mentioned the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit but there are other needs for a conclusion: the needs of industry for early clarity about the new rules, the need of European citizens for cheap, efficient competitive telecommunication services, the needs of European Union businesses for education, for research, for societal applications.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly want to ask about the rights of disabled users and to put a specific question to the Commission on the compromise presidency text. It is important, not just for social reasons, but for access to employment for disabled users. I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether in his view the presidency compromise encompasses those points of principle contained in both the framework directive and the universal service directive. There have been serious criticisms by disabled users about non-implementation of the RTTE directive and this is a crucial point for many of us. Parliament has rightly supported carefully delineated powers for the Commission and understands also that some qualification is essential. There is a need for clear rules consistently applied within national regulatory authorities and between regulatory authorities. The powers for the Commission need to be circumscribed and time-limited, as indeed they were in Parliament's amendments and in the presidency compromise. I very much hope that when we vote on Wednesday we will have reached an agreement between the political groups and between the three institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even more importantly, I hope they will go some way, in our drive for the knowledge-based society, towards lessening the divide there is between those who have access to information technology and those who do not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking on the access and interconnection directive which is extended to provide a pro-competitive and harmonised framework to stimulate competing network infrastructures and interoperability of services. I hope it will ensure that bottlenecks in the market do not constrain the emergence and growth of innovative services, especially for people with disabilities and services that will benefit users and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve these ambitious objectives, we first need to influence the way in which Member States regulate access and interconnection and secondly we need operators with SMP to grant other network operators interconnection facilities in a transparent way.</p>
<p class="contents">An area where we have had problems and where the harmonised approach between Members has been difficult to obtain under the current framework is international roaming and call termination in mobile networks. I know that this directive may not be the place for such detailed information, however, in the absence of any movement from the operators, I believe it is important for us to highlight this issue. The fact is the cost of terminating calls in mobile networks is ten times as much as terminating in fixed networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I can appreciate some of the problems in the international roaming, but the differences are too wide to be credible in terms of actual costs incurred and there is a huge spread of prices across Europe for the same service. The most expensive country is almost twice as expensive as the cheapest. I want to try to ensure, when we are looking at a level playing field and a single market, that the retail prices are cost-based and transparent and are of benefit to the consumer especially the SMEs who are trying to gain access across Europe and take advantage of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will have greater success than they had in implementing the local-loop directive across the fifteen Member States, because this directive needs to be implemented forthwith because lower prices, wider choice and better services are an absolute priority for the EU if we are to achieve a more socially-inclusive Europe and a one-speed Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The three institutions, Council, Parliament and Commission, were aware that the time factor was vital in the case of one of the fastest-developing technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on e-commerce has already been approved, we approved the directive on the unbundling of the local loop – which, by the way, the Member States have not yet fully complied with – but now the telecommunication business, which seemed secure, is encountering more and more problems, which is clearly not beneficial to users. A new framework is therefore necessary. And that is what this package of directives we are dealing with provides.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of more regulation. It is a question of regulating what is necessary, with a balance between consumers and operators. But, above all, it is a question of regulating in the same way, in an equal way, in order to prevent what was happening – a fragmentation of the internal market. That is why the European Parliament tried to resolve this problem, and the Council, in its common position, made a counter-offer, which I believe was insufficient, but now the Presidency has achieved a package which is more sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are being offered is clearly not ideal, it is not what we would all like to achieve, but as the saying goes, the best is the enemy of the good, and, for the sake of the certainty of the operators, for the sake of the need to have a filter in the Commission to deal with the problems of the internal market, and also, it should be said, for the sake of the good image of the operation of our institutions, I recommend that we approve this package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with responsibility for consideration of the authorisation and radio spectrum directives, and also as my group's shadow rapporteur on the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">All these reports have been adopted unanimously in the Cultural Committee, and we have managed to bring substantial points from our position to bear in the leading Committee as well. In the Council, on the contrary, all the Committee's concerns have been utterly cast to the winds, which it would be an understatement to describe as disappointing. To get to the point: even though the package of directives we are discussing is called the ‘telecoms package’ for the sake of brevity, it must be clearly pointed out that it certainly does not deal only with telecommunication issues in the strict sense of the word. Technical convergence does indeed mean that electronic services cannot be divided up by reference to their channels of distribution or the devices used to receive them, but this is specifically, in our view, about digital television and other services related to journalism.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters to the Committee on Culture, therefore, is that the whole wide range of Europe's cultural diversity should find a place on the networks and not be merely subject to the laws of the market and of competition. This means that we see the issue of interoperability, like that of obligations to transmit, as being essential. By these means alone will Member States and participants in the market have the legal security to guarantee services of general interest and only thus will the provision of the full range of services for everyone be guaranteed in terms of both supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">It is self-evident that Europe, for its part, does not have a duty to regulate the content of transmissions, but it is obliged to see to it that culture is not beaten into submission by commerce. The bottom line is that doing without interoperability does not only impose limits on culture, but positively militates against the internal market. So the Council's compromise is inadequate in every way, and we assume that there will be more change in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I do not want a market where competition rules supreme. Regulation is necessary both economically and socially. If you have no competition, you will have no service innovation, but if you have cut-throat competition, you will not have service innovation either. It is necessary therefore to get the balance right. So, I would suggest to the Commission and Council that Parliament is offering them an opportunity to improve the balance of the package before them, and I would urge them to accept the proposals being put forward by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">By coincidence, the Commission came forward today with a working document on the performance of industries providing services of general economic interest, and this also covered telecoms. That document indicates that liberalisation in general is having a net beneficial effect, but I would suggest to the Commission that they need to come forward with a lot more research and hard evidence in relation to specific sectors to convince me that it is true in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would suggest that the Commission needs urgently to take on board the suspicions regarding price-fixing with regard to roaming mobile telephone calls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this instance there are a number of questions that present themselves at the same time. Is the Commission already able to assess how much the market will now change – not only in the direction of more competition? What effects can we expect to see on jobs? Can you, on the basis of the package about to be adopted, already estimate whether the digital divide really will be reduced? Would what is currently going on not be an ideal opportunity to actually put transparency into practice, both as regards costs and at the consumer end? We are indeed currently finding that the new directives mean that we will have to deal with a flood of confusing information about telecommunications charges, and transparency should surely be at least as important in economics as in politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Consultation with users is essential in order to ensure we have optimum regulations from a social point of view.

<p class="contents">So we need to focus on measures for minority users, such as providing public telephones at fixed locations or equivalent measures for deaf or speech impaired people. At the same time, once this parameter is accepted, we need to develop quality of service standards for services for minority groups alongside general quality of service standards, because that is the only way we shall be able to monitor the degree of access which these people have to electronic services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since Lisbon, successive European Councils have called on the Commission, Council and Parliament to ensure that the new framework is in place by the end of this year. We still have two weeks to go. Time is running short, but the EU still has the chance to meet this deadline. The package of compromise amendments before you today has a broad level of support in the Council, as the presidency told us today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, a compromise. Nobody gets everything they want – neither Parliament, the Council nor the Commission. But the Commission nonetheless believes that it is a balanced compromise. My assessment is that neither institution is likely to get more from conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on this package will send an important, positive signal externally. We all know that the communications sector has had a rough ride over the last year or so. Early agreement on this package will be a welcome boost.</p>
<p class="contents">The package will have a positive impact on the sector in a number of different ways. The new framework will deregulate, requiring regulators progressively to remove regulation as it becomes unnecessary, so that they regulate only when there is market failure. In this way, the package provides a transition to the final objective we all share: reliance on competition law to control market power in the electronic communications sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The new framework simplifies and deregulates national licensing regimes, removing prior regulatory control over market access for network and service provision, and focusing such controls only on frequency and numbering resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It preserves and strengthens universal service, striking the right balance between the rights of users and the need not to impose disproportionate burdens on operators. In particular, it makes it clear that functional Internet access is a key part of the bundle of services that must be affordable and available to all EU citizens. Mr Martin asked me about the impact of this solution for the digital divide and employment. It is very clear that universal service has a key impact on availability. But we also need policy measures which concentrate on the skills of all citizens and on content. We need availability at a low price; we need skills and content in everyone's own language to close the digital divide.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and crucially – the new framework, with the amendments contained in the compromise package, would include the necessary safeguards to ensure that regulators act consistently across the EU, so that companies can expect to be treated similarly in similar situations throughout the EU. Here I particularly want to thank the European Parliament for its strong support, without which we would not have been able to achieve this kind of compromise with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will explain how the compromise package deals with the three fundamental issues that dominated discussion between the Council and Parliament during second reading: right of appeal (Article 4), the transparency mechanism (Article 6 of the framework directive), including matters related to radio spectrum, and finally interoperability of digital TV equipment – which has been raised by many colleagues tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">On right of appeal, the compromise package takes Parliament’s line by requiring Member States to ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">On the transparency mechanism, the compromise package goes a long way towards Parliament and the Commission’s position. The text gives the Commission hard powers to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw draft measures in the key areas linked to the functioning of the single market: definition of markets and designation, or otherwise, of undertakings with significant market power (SMP). Commission decisions are subject to an advisory committee procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Radio spectrum is covered by Article 6, paragraph 2, whereby regulators are required to cooperate with each other to ensure consistent application of the regulatory framework. The compromise does not provide for hard powers of intervention by the Commission on spectrum matters. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that this provision, together with the Spectrum Decision, will improve co-ordination of radio spectrum policy matters across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Spectrum Decision, the Commission is very satisfied with the compromise proposal, as the major objectives pursued in the original Commission proposal are met. The adoption of the Spectrum Decision in this form would constitute a major step forward. Furthermore, it demonstrates how far positions in this important matter have evolved, given the failure not so long ago of legislative proposals along similar lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spectrum Decision in its present form will set up a general and permanent framework for addressing radio spectrum policy and legal issues in the context of all relevant Community policy areas. It thereby reflects the increasing importance of radio spectrum in the context of Community policy objectives which depend on the availability and efficient management of frequencies as a vital resource for the provision of economically and socially important wireless usage in electronic communications, transport, broadcasting and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spectrum Decision makes it possible to take appropriate action to ensure efficient use of spectrum and spectrum management. It also provides for technical implementing measures to be adopted under the Spectrum Decision as a mechanism to ensure legal certainty. Many Members of the European Parliament have raised the issue of digital television. We clearly have got the message from the European Parliament. On digital TV interoperability, the compromise package goes towards Parliament’s position, by taking over much of the European Parliament text. A new article and corresponding recital would be inserted in the framework directive, dealing specifically with interoperability of digital interactive television services.</p>
<p class="contents">It would impose an obligation on Member States to encourage the use of open application programme interfaces by platform operators and equipment manufacturers. In addition, Member States would also be required to encourage API owners to make available, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, all such information as is necessary to enable service providers to provide all services supported by the Application Programme Interfaces.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly an obligation to encourage does not go as far as an obligation to ensure. But – and I emphasise this – the provisions of Article 16 on standardisation allow standards to be made mandatory one year after entry into force of the directive if interoperability cannot be ensured by the use of voluntary standards. The combination of these two provisions constitutes a step forward for the interoperability of digital television, which we all agree is a desirable outcome for European consumers. Article 16 means that one year after entry into force of the directive, the Commission must organise public consultation then propose the comitology procedure, followed by Commission adoption. Furthermore, as we have really understood the strong will of the European Parliament to go forward with interoperability, the Commission is ready to start actively to promote European standards for interoperability with all stakeholders concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Read and Mr Fitzsimons raised the issue of the disabled here today. Firstly, on the amendments on the disabled, most of them have been accepted in the Council position, except perhaps for two, which overlap with the Council text. Secondly, I am personally convinced that information technologies give us better chances than before to give equal possibilities to the disabled. When we make society better for the disabled, it is better for all of us. Last week we had the information society technologies conference, in which Mrs Read also participated. We saw fantastic new applications which make life for the disabled better. We must absolutely encourage their use. The same was true with the e-government conference. We proceed along those lines. The accessibility guidelines recommendation from the Commission a few weeks ago is another example here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the link between the RTTE directive and this package goes, we are ready to consider and study that issue. I will come back to that later.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package is always a compromise. No institution gets everything it wants. But this compromise is a balanced one. It represents a proper balance between the views of the Council and Parliament. As such the Commission would recommend that the House accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will transmit to the sessional services of the European Parliament the detailed position on the amendments, including those not covered by the Council compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank the European Parliament and the presidency for their particularly close and substantial cooperation on this file. My particular thanks go to the rapporteurs, Mrs Niebler, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Harbour and Mr Brunetta, the rapporteurs for the five telecom directives, as well as the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not want to forget the shadow rapporteurs and those other Members of the European Parliament who have participated so actively in the discussion of the telecoms package. It has been an excellent example of how Community method at its best can work. It has been an extremely complicated legal package. Everybody had a role to play. We worked towards the same compromise solution and – if it goes through this week – very rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of this would be that Europe would have the most modern, technology-neutral legislation for the future. I am sure it would be good for jobs, good for growth, good for equal access for all. I hope that this package will be accepted this week in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
