<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funke, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am pleased to be taking part this evening in the final debate of this House on the Agenda 2000 reform project. Both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner delivered their opinions this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, you will continue the debate this evening with a general discussion. The European Parliament"s political discussions on Agenda 2000 will then come to a close with tomorrow"s vote. The conclusion will be, as it were, a tailor‐made one because by approving the Agenda 2000 proposals the European Parliament is laying the foundations, during the final part‐session of both this parliamentary term and the German Presidency, for the future development of the European Union and not least the future common agricultural policy. However, this decision will also bring to an end a discussion which has occupied both politicians and professional groups in all the Member States for two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission presented its statement entitled ‘Agenda 2000 – a stronger and wider Union" in spring 1997, an all‐out effort has been made to change the direction of the common agricultural policy. I should like to point out in particular that the European Parliament has made its position on this absolutely clear from the outset. It has claimed a constructive role in the process through the resolutions it has adopted and, in particular, by taking up positions of substance. When you deliver your opinion tomorrow on the decisions of both the agricultural ministers and the Heads of State and Government, you will be adopting a reform which clearly bears the European Parliament"s mark as well. Even though many people would have wished for more far‐reaching decisions in one area or another, we should perhaps accept that this reform meets the demands made on it. I will mention four main areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A maximum of EUR 297 billion will be made available for the agricultural budget during the period 2000‐2006. Agricultural expenditure in real terms will therefore still be limited to the present level. The reform of the common agricultural policy and pre‐accession aid also prepare the Community for enlargement eastward in the agricultural sector. The common agricultural policy"s stronger orientation towards the market and the environment will equip the Community with an offensive negotiating strategy at the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations. It can also use this to defend the European model of agriculture with its high standards of quality, safety and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures to promote rural development have been extended considerably and can now be developed into a second pillar of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the complexity of the subject matter and the obvious conflicts of interest in this area between the Member States as well, I think it was not to be taken for granted that the negotiations on the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 would be concluded successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the result of hard work, but I think it is first and foremost the result of the exemplary form of cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council which was based on trust and was always constructive. It has also been a matter of concern for me from the outset to promote the dialogue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Perhaps you will agree with me that in the informal conciliation procedure we have developed an instrument which in the past few months has proved to be exemplary. In addition to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, information has been exchanged on a regular basis, allowing you, ladies and gentlemen, to be kept up to date on the Council"s views. The agricultural ministers have also been kept fully informed of your opinions. In particular, I would add that, as President‐in‐Office of the Council, the position of the European Parliament was always a very useful trump card when seeking solutions during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached the end of a long and – we should not conceal this fact – sometimes difficult journey. I believe that we have taken a decision to the best of our knowledge and beliefs which should be of use to Europe and its citizens. This is definitely a joint project, and I hope very much that it will also be a joint success.</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank you all for your support and trust in me. I am thinking particularly of Mr Fischler here, and the contribution he made during the negotiations. I should like to stress this point. This kind of cooperation based on trust has been most gratifying, even though it took up a great deal of our time, sometimes into the night. I also thank all those who participated. In spite of all the controversy which we dealt with, it was always clear that there was a joint effort to make decisions. In particular, the way in which we argued with each other in order to make these decisions speaks for itself. I think it was described by everyone as appropriate and friendly. I sensed this from the reactions of various people who participated in the project too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jové Peres </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the implementation of the Berlin agreements will mean that the process of farms disappearing and jobs being destroyed, which already started with the 1992 reform, will become more pronounced. In addition, this process will largely affect small and medium‐sized farms, as they will be only partially compensated through income aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – and this is the worst element, in my group"s view – no means of correcting the existing imbalances between continental and Mediterranean production and between small and large farms has been introduced. The financial allocations for continental production are being increased again, while those for Mediterranean production remain frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme approved in Berlin will also have a severe negative impact on the social fabric of the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Do the Commission and the Council really expect the timid rural development measures to compensate for that impact? The rural development measures proposed are going to be implemented to give preferential treatment to the richer Member States that have a smaller percentage of farmers. In addition, the Commission"s proposal will exclude fruit and vegetable growers from the benefits of the rural development measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely astonished that Parliament"s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected an amendment tabled by my group to correct this situation and that the amendment was declared inadmissible in the House pursuant to Rule 60 of the Rules of Procedure. It is just as well that, in this case, the Berlin European Council did intend to correct that point, highlighting the paradox of what happened in Parliament"s Committee on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been CAP reforms since 1992 intended, presumably, to correct the uneven economic support granted to small and large farms. In the wake of the Commission"s timid proposal, the Berlin agreements are a step backwards in terms of limiting aid to large farms and increasing support to small and medium‐sized farms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture"s position represents no progress in that direction either, and I must say once again that it is unfortunate that an amendment by my group on modifications to the aid was declared inadmissible.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, my political group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, will not support a reform of the CAP which will actually mean that its main imbalances will become more marked.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this concluding debate on Agenda 2000 should be limited to the main thrust of the reforms. If we now try to bring controversial amendments we risk bringing down the whole Berlin package like a house of cards. I am thinking, for example, of the amendment in the Görlach report to increase setting‐up aid from EUR 25 000 to EUR 35 000. A number of Member States simply cannot accept such cost‐increasing proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The central question today is: do we accept the financial basis of Agenda 2000 and are we going to confirm this in an interinstitutional agreement? My answer is a straightforward ‘Yes". If the Union wants to give applicant countries the real prospect of accession we must look at how this is to be financed. The financial perspective agreed in Berlin is essential for this. The Council has succeeded in drawing up an efficient multiannual budget, thus creating the financial scope for enlargement. I do, however, have great difficulty with certain elements of the package, such as the Council"s unfortunate insistence that the ceiling on structural expenditure must also be a target. But all things considered, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that recourse to Article 203 of the Treaty, which is what many Members of Parliament were calling for, is the right way forward, since it would result in an increase in the Union"s expenditure which net contributors in particular would find unacceptable. My principal objection to the use of Article 203 is, however, that it would effectively mean making the financing of enlargement dependent upon the uncertain outcomes of the annual budgetary conflicts between the Council and European Parliament. This is completely unacceptable.</p>

It will have succeeded in moving forward from positions which threatened to produce yet another trial of strength between the European institutions. After repeated misunderstandings with the Commission on the progress of the work, which threatened to discredit the efforts being made, we are finally together not only on the texts of the new regulations but on a starting point for active collaboration in the management of the Funds through the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament on the implementation of the structural policies. Parliament has had an important voice in defining the guidelines for this reform, but it must have an even more important one throughout the programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad the Council accepted Parliament"s request to restore URBAN as one of the Community initiatives, albeit at the end of the negotiations. That was not obstinacy on our part as Members of Parliament, it was simply recognising the key role of urban areas in regional development. The balanced and complementary development of urban and rural areas is essential for economic and regional development. This means intensifying cooperation at all levels with the regional and local authorities and socio‐economic operators closest to the evolving situation in the region. Greater competitiveness between regions must take account of the risks of imbalance caused by the differences in levels of employment and human resources, in infrastructure quality, in the natural environment and in development, especially in the delicate phase we are now entering with the identification of regions eligible for Objective 2.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of reform, generally speaking, but we do have certain reservations about grey areas not yet examined in depth – for example, the impact on the regions whose development process will be put on hold for the sake of the principle of concentration. The people of these areas will be penalised, and that hardly helps to demonstrate that the European Union is working for the development of the less‐favoured regions. Actually my own country, Italy, is likely to be seriously penalised by the calculation of the Objective 2 ceiling: added to the guaranteed maximum reduction of 33 % there is the reduction caused by the inclusion of the regions coming out of Objective 1.</p>

I hope that that does not prove to be the case because it would be an inadequate end to a subject as important as the one we are debating this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that we are debating ‘how" and ‘how much" at the same time. And we may agree on ‘how" but not on ‘how much". Yet tonight we have to decide on both aspects at once.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer specifically to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the cohesion policies. I agree with the ‘how", exactly as planned by the Commissioner, and I would also like to take this opportunity once again to congratulate the Commissioner and DG XVI. We have worked closely with her and she has helped us immensely in moving cohesion forward during these past five years and, I believe, also for the years ahead. I agree with the report by Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs McCarthy in relation to Objective 1, coordination and partnership projects, and so on. So Mrs Wulf‐Mathies and Mr Eneko Landaburu have not only the support, but also the appreciation of the parliamentary committee that has worked with them on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are entering an era where the European Union has more powers. It has a codecision procedure, a single currency and a single market, and we want improved cohesion and a worthy enlargement. We want social policies, policies on employment, on rural development and on trans‐European networks. And what does the Council offer us in its Berlin negotiations? It offers us a move from that mythical figure of 1.27 % – which was so difficult to get past – to 0.97 %. It offers us a reduction and a <span class="italic">de facto</span> renationalisation of the funds the European Union needs, and I have to say that quite a few Members will say ‘no" to the Council tomorrow, precisely on the issue of the financial perspective.</p>

In view of the timetable for ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, the Council and the Commission have already agreed that as far as possible, the European Parliament should be granted those rights to which it has only formally been entitled since 1 May this year, particularly in the area of structural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament and perhaps also as representatives of the Member States, we can agree under these circumstances, and with a clear conscience, to the results of Agenda 2000 and the decision‐making procedure regarding this. The most important objectives which the Commission had already envisaged are entirely reasonable. Concentrating on the real problems and problem areas, less bureaucratic structures, and greater efficiency and transparency generally make good sense.</p>
<p class="contents">If other important practical, national and regional concerns have been dealt with in addition to this, the matter is a really coherent one. In this respect, as a representative of my country, I welcome the special consideration given to rural development under the new Objective 2. I also approve of the new phasing‐out regulation for former Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions where regeneration has almost been achieved but a little bit more is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the new Interreg regulation in particular, because we have worked long and hard on it, and I hope in particular that the regions bordering with the applicant countries at the EU"s external borders will take advantage of the time and money available. At any rate, for Austria this amounts to ATS 5 billion over the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">My enthusiasm for Agenda 2000 is limited on one decisive issue. Is it really justifiable to celebrate the fact that we all want Europe to cost us less in the future as one of the most successful conclusions of Berlin at a time when we are all rightly calling for more European integration in employment, structural reform in general, the EU enlargement process, and solidarity for the wider Europe? Is 1 % of Europe"s gross domestic product really too much for the Member States to pay when national quotas are 40 % or more? I do not think so!</p>

I see this as a sign of esteem for the European Parliament, as also is the presence of German Minister Funke. This too should be acknowledged. It shows that you are ready to listen, at whatever hour Parliament calls its speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Flynn, you naturally called for support for the proposals to reform the European Social Fund. My group will certainly be doing so, and will also be supporting Mrs Jöns"s proposals. When it comes to employment and job creation we must all join together to do the best we can. But at the same time we cannot deny that a large group in society is in need of special attention, and by this I mean people in a disadvantaged position, such as women and minorities. This is expressed in Parliament"s amendments, and it was particularly the Council that was not too keen on it. I hope that we can work together to achieve further progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to something which is very close to my heart: the European Social Fund and also, Mr Fischler, the new budget for rural development. I very much welcome them both. I believe the European Social Fund is a means of giving impetus to job creation in Europe, just as the fund for rural development is something which should facilitate the major changes which large sections of the farming sector have to make. Of course it is also the case that the resources for rural development are insufficient. My fear, Mr Funke, is that when it comes to implementation the Member States will look primarily to their own interests. I very much fear that alongside these very welcome budgetary headings that we have agreed a number of other things will creep in which we most certainly do not want to encourage. The first thing that could creep in is that Member States will seek to use European money to solve their own problems. If that happens, the people will rightly say that we are just dishing out money.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing we must carefully guard against is the consultancies and other intermediaries walking away with the funds made available to introduce these changes. I believe European‐level management and monitoring in this area to be one of the most important tasks for the future. We will have no credibility in the eyes of the people of Europe if on the one hand we say we want to exercise control over a number of problems and will make money available to do it, and then allow that money to disappear into the pockets of organisations and individuals who are not entitled to it.</p>
<p class="contents">This may be my last speech as although I am eligible for re‐election my party is not doing so well. My final appeal to the Commission is therefore to pay careful attention to this, and if I am not re‐elected I hope that I can read in the newspaper that you have received the message. If I am re‐elected, I will most certainly ensure that this happens.</p>

But it is a great pleasure for me to do this, given that we are talking about an important measure, that is Agenda 2000, which deals with some extremely complex aspects of the European farming world. I do not know exactly what the European agricultural model is, nor does anyone else, but we intend to defend this model come what may, as it keeps farmers on the land and stops the countryside from becoming deserted.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the common agricultural policy will of course continue to represent an uneven playing field given that, as it is based on the idea of historical productivity, richer countries come off distinctly better than poorer countries, much as I dislike distinguishing between rich and poor countries. It is obvious that if some allowance were made for the difference between richer and poorer regions in Europe, the poorer ones would certainly not need so‐called ‘rural development', a rather vague and underfunded concept which we all know tends to mean that you only get out what you put in in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that there will not be a budget for this ‘rural development', which would in practice be a way of re‐establishing the balance between the more‐ and less‐favoured regions. Even in the sectors where we are undeniably more competitive – such as wine‐making – there will not be any money for re‐establishing old vineyards.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the European Union still considers wool to be a non‐agricultural product. It is to be hoped that with the promotion we have been promised for our products, and despite the limited funding we have been allocated, we can still be competitive in the war which is increasingly being waged at world level.</p>

<p class="contents">So it is not surprising that despite earlier hopes that it would be maintained, the Cohesion Fund has emerged from Berlin with reduced resources, which will result in cuts for some cohesion countries, including my own, Portugal. Nor is it acceptable that, contrary to what Parliament approved in November 1998, the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund in relation to the stability pact is to be maintained, and that, for example, the Committee on Regional Policy should now be presenting an opinion in favour of the proposal for a regulation which envisages exactly this type of conditionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Without affecting the cheques distributed by the various countries, regulating the Structural Funds, especially by means of intermediate assessments of the efficiency reserve and by a general lowering of cofinancing levels, will in practice result in appropriations being ‘expenditure limits', whereas they were previously ‘expenditure targets'. There will certainly be a big difference between what was announced in Berlin and what will actually happen. And these are not positive points like maintaining the URBAN Community initiative, which in fact runs counter to opinion in Berlin. This could make a difference to the considerable doubt concerning the soundness and the efficiency of the regulation of the Structural Funds in future.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point about the common agricultural policy and the reform agreed upon in Berlin, or rather the non‐reform. Berlin neither restored a balance to nor promoted a reversal of the present discrimination between types of production and farmers. A few one‐off increases in financing distributed between a few countries will do nothing to change internal imbalances, and may if anything accentuate them, even within apparently more favoured countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, I am speaking basically on the Arias Cañete report. We are going to vote against, as we did in committee. It is very important to stress that this is not because we do not agree with structural funds for fisheries. On the contrary. A fund is important to accomplish many necessary structural changes. But what we disagree with in this report is the way that it has emerged from the committee. Basically what Mr Arias Cañete wants to do is continue with the existing system which rejects changes and improvements proposed by the Commission. Two examples: last year the Court of Auditors examined in detail the funding for joint enterprises and made several critical comments. The Commission's proposal attempted to incorporate changes to improve the system. These were not taken up in the Arias Cañete report.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations. But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report. As well as that we have two major problems with the Commission's proposal. The Commission has very little control over how money is spent and has publicly admitted as much. Too much is left up to the Member States. Not enough consideration has been given to criteria for granting aid. Vessels differ in their environmental and social impact and preference should be given to funding the withdrawal of damaging units and the creation of less destructive units.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee we forwarded an amendment on transparency which was not accepted by the committee. Not only was it not accepted by the committee, but the rapporteur himself did not support it. This is unfortunate – plus the fact that the Rules of Procedure have left it impossible for us to submit this amendment again, which means that we cannot get a registered roll‐call vote on the fact that Members are failing to adhere to the whole issue of transparency. That is why we are voting against this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the last major debate in this parliamentary term and it is an excellent debate on a highly symbolic issue: Agenda 2000, as discussed in Berlin, in fact, with the German Chancellor, the rediscovered Reichstag, the rediscovered eagle and even a war. Obviously this makes a change from the rather puerile debates we have sometimes had over the last five years, such as those concerning lesbians, footballers" transfers or generic medicines. And Agenda 2000 raises important issues: the European agricultural strategy, the future of our food supplies, the structural policy and the financing of Europe, not to mention the opening up to the East.</p>
<p class="contents">On agriculture, Commissioner, we are still on line 92, the McSharry line, the Steichen line, the Blair House line. Prices are being reduced – 20 %, 15 %, 30 % – with a small compromise in Berlin, partial compensation and some illusions. There are illusions because by playing around on the world market and lowering prices, we will certainly never be able to catch up with Argentina, for example, in terms of the meat trade. And it is certainly dangerous to play around on the world market and overlap free trade areas. This is illustrated by what Mr Martin said earlier in relation to winegrowers, with Sweden and Ireland being designated winegrowing areas so that they can obtain concentrated musts and perhaps manufacture industrial wines.</p>
<p class="contents">And what good is an agreement in Berlin when in six months" time the world trade negotiations will begin and, just as in 1992, we are starting to make concessions even before those negotiations have started? That raises the problem of our agricultural model. Mr Rosado Fernandes and many others spoke about it, just as you did, Commissioner. We talk about the European agricultural model. It is a model that stands for quality and welfare. It is a model that stands against the American model of intensive agriculture. Perhaps you have a third model, which I would call the Austrian agricultural model, because, alongside the Wagnerian American production, this would be light‐hearted farming, with farmers looking after the countryside, nature and the environment, so that Sissi could go for a country walk at the weekend. No doubt that is what you call the environmental section of the CAP. Farmers would manage the countryside and eventually be included under the regional funds.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the Structural Funds. There, too, Berlin has hidden part of the truth. Apparently there are compromises. The Spanish wanted EUR 240 billion, the Dutch wanted EUR 193 billion and EUR 213 billion was agreed on. But in reality, the winners keep winning – Spain still gets the Christmas tree with EUR 9 billion and Great Britain still gets its cheque – while the losers keep losing. France has even lost out on Objective 1 and farmers are going to lose out on Objective 2 because they are now lumped in with the suburbs. Moreover, the Eastern European countries are soon to arrive and the planned funding is quite modest: EUR 3 billion a year for the pre‐accession period, which is clearly inadequate. So what will we do then? We will have to either share out the poverty between the farmers coming in and those who are already here, or we will have to create a new resource. And that is the third problem: funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of this problem. Germany does not want to pay more, and it is quite right. It loses EUR 11 billion every year. France loses between EUR 1 billion and EUR 4 billion. So unless expenditure is reduced there is only one solution: resources must be found. Because of your foolishness in terms of constantly reducing customs duties, particularly as regards the GSPs, they no longer amount to anything: they account for only 14 % of resources. The share of VAT is falling. We obviously still have the GNP resource, but that is not a federal resource, it is the traditional contribution to an international organisation, a state"s contribution. Berlin clearly sought to increase the share of the GNP contribution. But that is not enough: by moving to 20, 21 or 25 Member States, and putting a ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP on the budget envelope, we will not even last a few years. We need other resources.</p>
<p class="contents">They cannot seriously come from the CO<span class="sub">2 </span> tax as Mr Ripa di Meana and the Greens believe, because nobody has ever seen carbon dioxide produce taxes, otherwise Pinatubo would probably be spitting euros. So there is only one resource left: a European income tax. And that is exactly where Berlin did not tell the truth. Just like the Europe of free trade, the Europe of the great single market lied; it did not tell us it was the Europe of 20 million unemployed and 50 million excluded. The ultra‐liberal Europe is lying now and it is not saying that in 2006 it will be the Europe of taxation and the Europe of a European income tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, that is why, on 14 June, we want to come back and we will come back to change Europe.</p>

I in fact believe that, although it contains certain weaknesses, the agreement that was reached at Berlin on Agenda 2000 is a success that can be attributed to the German Presidency. The prophets of doom were proved wrong, and confirmation was given to both the priority that the European Union places on the policy of economic and social cohesion and the admirable and particularly effective cooperation between the main political Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming, as I do, from a cohesion country, Greece, I want to express my satisfaction with the provisions laid down in the three major chapters of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Firstly, as regards agriculture, I am satisfied with the preservation of the Community nature of agricultural policy, in spite of intense pressure to establish cofinancing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Secondly, in respect of structural actions, I am satisfied with the preservation of increased per capita funding of the cohesion countries from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and also with the emphasis placed on combating unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Thirdly, with regard to the chapter on own resources, I am satisfied with the adoption of a more just system which favours less‐developed countries. My position, however, is that the system on own resources needs to be changed, which will inevitably lead to an increase in the Community budget so that needs can be met and the ambitious aims of the European Union can be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Finally, I would like to congratulate all those who contributed to this historic Berlin agreement, especially Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies for her tireless effort and my colleagues for the quality of their opinions.</p>

I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, because he has incorporated the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control in his report on the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement. I should like at the same time to refer to the most important, but also the most logical of these amendments. We have jointly agreed with the Council in the text that before the European Union"s budget is adopted, an additional trialogue meeting will always be held at which the Council, the Commission and Parliament will agree on how possible additional requirements – last year there was the matter of aid for Russia – can be covered by the appropriations not utilised in the current financial year, or how new requirements in the next financial year should be dealt with and how full agreement can be reached on this before the budget is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this procedure comes very close to what the Member States want, but also what Europe"s citizens want, which is that a rigorous and efficient budget be adopted each year. I should also like to mention another amendment which the rapporteur has included, and which is connected with the discussion that took place on Monday evening in plenary: the 1996/97 discharge procedure. We now have a procedure whereby new regulations are very often adopted by the Council without the old regulation having been evaluated. We have made a suggestion in this regard, and the Council has been prepared at least up to now to accept that if possible, a new regulation should not be adopted by the Council before an evaluation of the old one has been completed. If this could be carried through, we would achieve a real success because it makes no sense to establish during the procedure for a new regulation that the old regulation was in fact not acceptable and the new one reveals the same shortcomings. I would therefore invite the Council to establish its position once more on this matter in detail, because Parliament has done so.</p>

When EU aid is being allocated and prioritised, it is important to pay particular attention to matters of the environment and health. In order for the single market to function, including, <span class="italic">inter alia, </span> a free trade policy in food, it is extremely important that applicant countries comply with the relevant health and hygiene regulations imposed by the EU. The EU cannot make compromises on these issues within the framework of a period of transition. Instead, some degree of flexibility is required when allocating EU aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Regional Policy we wish to stress the importance of three issues, in addition to that of flexibility. Firstly, we would like to emphasise the importance of cross‐border cooperation while preparations are being made for membership. This is especially important in developing networks linking government, businesses and organisations. Secondly, we would like to stress the importance of nuclear safety, and, for that reason, EU resources granted for purposes of nuclear safety must be concentrated within the context of PHARE. Thirdly, we want to stress the importance of training people to promote the structural changes that are now under way in the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, prioritisation is important, but it has to be achieved through viable cooperation with the applicant countries. For that reason, the administration process must not be allowed to become too ponderous, especially when we consider how relatively meagre the resources are. I am also in favour of allowing the Commission a certain amount of licence in order to achieve maximum effectiveness in the area of aid.</p>

In our opinion, many aspects of Agenda 2000 are worthy of criticism and ought to be criticised, and some Members have done that this evening and in the course of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">But that does not apply to the fisheries policy. The outcome in terms of the rules for assistance in the fisheries sector can be considered satisfactory thanks to the attitude of the Committee on Fisheries which opposed the Commission"s original plan from the start. It opposed this original plan because it destroyed the horizontal nature of the intervention measures and established a financing system charged to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, which made the planning of this intervention enormously difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">These aspects of the initial proposal were changed after Parliament voted against them a few months ago and the final proposal establishes a unitary instrument for intervention in the fisheries sector. Although there are still two regulations, there is only one fund, which means that structural intervention can be properly dealt with in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nearly finished, Mr President, but I do not want to end without mentioning an important fact: modernising the fishing fleet is certainly important, structural intervention is very important, but the future of fishing, for our fleet, depends largely on the existence of international agreements with third countries to provide fishing grounds for that fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">There are grounds for concern here, at least in some parts of the European Union. In my specific case, coming from Andalusia, I must point out that the Moroccan Government has just confirmed that it does not intend to extend the current agreement, which raises serious problems for tens of thousands of fishermen in my region, Andalusia, and also in Galicia. And although I know that this is not exactly what we are discussing today, I do not want to end without drawing attention to this very important problem.</p>

The Fischler proposals cast a great shadow over rural Europe to begin with, but at the end of the day we have to appreciate that the outcome, while not totally satisfactory, certainly is not disastrous by any means.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we are projecting to spend more money on rural Europe, together with the fact that the number of people involved in agriculture is decreasing, ensures that for the next seven years there is a minimum standard of living guaranteed to people involved in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired. We have had the MacSharry reform, another tranche of it now. Farmers have been traumatised by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Fischler that while his message was not an easy one to sell he made a great effort to explain it to the farmers of Europe. His efforts are much appreciated, his efforts to educate and inform and bring public opinion along were commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">I was not as happy with the outcome of the issue of regional policy. We are winding down regional policy. The region to which I belong retained its Objective 1 status but nevertheless it is only really Objective 1 in transition, because the amount of money received under the new Objective 1 is actually much reduced from the amount per capita under the last programme. In any case we, too, appreciate the efforts that were made by the outgoing Commissioner. She worked extremely hard, not only in visiting the depressed areas of the Union, but particularly in relation to Northern Ireland and all the cross‐border schemes. Her presence was much appreciated and her total commitment to the whole issue of regional development is accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is only one person in the room tonight who will have a vote in my election: Commissioner Flynn will have the opportunity to vote for me. I should like to say we much appreciate all the hard work he has also done, and indeed all the Commissioners.</p>

I am currently examining the effects of the Agenda 2000 package on this region, which is one that is dependent on agriculture, although production conditions are much poorer than in the farming regions of Central Europe. The report on the Union"s northern dimension states that the issue of the northern dimension must figure in all decision‐making connected with the Union"s internal development, in accordance with the resolutions of the Vienna European Council. In addition, a decision was taken at the Luxembourg summit that the future of agriculture must be safeguarded everywhere in the EU area.</p>
<p class="contents">How did Agenda 2000 take these views into account? Through negotiation the EU"s northernmost farming regions, which are also the world"s northernmost farming regions, gained a few important concessions to compensate for the costs incurred because of natural problems. The grain drying premium and forage aid are the right tools: they should simply be on a more adequate scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural measures are important, but they are not enough in themselves to solve economic problems in the northern regions. The fields are covered in snow in April, whether they are thirty or two hundred hectares in size. It was still nearly ten degrees below zero in my home region just this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic behind paying aid by the hectare is very hard to explain to farm workers in northern Finland. Why should those who reap the best harvests receive many times more in aid payments than those whose harvests are small because of the natural conditions? Hopefully, this trend will change, as Parliament has already agreed, and the differences in payments of aid by the hectare will be reduced.</p>

We are at the end of a long haul, and we have got here in pretty good shape. The results are not perfect, but despite the inadequate budgets and the faint‐ hearted reform of the common agricultural policy, and the continuing injustices and imbalances that it preserves, we have nevertheless avoided a serious crisis in the European Union and it is fair to say that over the next few years the European Union will forge ahead with confidence and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">This process has reached a satisfactory conclusion, and it has had a happy ending for the cohesion countries and for the poorer regions in which structural assistance is to be concentrated from now on. I cannot resist saying that it has come to a satisfactory conclusion for my country, which will receive structural support at an annual average level slightly higher than the annual average between 1994 and 1999. So Portugal and the other cohesion countries will be in a position to maintain their development and modernisation and converge with the European average, and this is actually happening, especially in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we welcome the financial perspectives, the interinstitutional agreement and the structural policies. We wish to congratulate the German Presidency on the work it has done in the face of the scepticism which has beset this presidency. And I can tell Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies – if I may paraphrase the words of a previous speaker – that if she were a candidate for election to the European Parliament in Portugal, the Portuguese would vote for her in droves.</p>

<p class="contents">I should also mention that this strategy was agreed on in our committee after three public hearings with representatives of the fisheries sector and each and every one of the national fisheries departments. The result was the excellent report by Mr Arias Cañete, which has served as a basis for the negotiations with the Council. In my view, this report has led to an excellent compromise, which I welcome. Above all, I appreciate the fruitful collaboration that was displayed between Parliament and the Council. I include in my thanks all the staff who helped us reach a compromise that includes three of Parliament"s principal objectives: a horizontal legal instrument, a single financial instrument, the FIFG, and a basic regulation finally covering all the financial structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this has been one of Parliament"s major successes, but we cannot rest on our laurels because we still need to ensure the continuity of certain measures with regard to the implementing regulation, and this is dealt with in the second part of the Arias report. In my opinion, without that continuity, the fisheries structural policy loses much of its meaning. For instance, we need continuity of measures to maintain a modern, safe and competitive fleet or measures that have proved to be extremely effective instruments of fisheries policy, such as joint enterprises with third countries. These are drained of content by the Commission"s proposal, when they could be an excellent formula for cooperation with third countries, as will surely be demonstrated in the future in the case of Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">These demands are perfectly reflected in the report by Mr Arias Cañete, his final task for the European Parliament, and he leaves us with one of the finest and most comprehensive fisheries documents we have ever had the opportunity to consider. I therefore call on Parliament to vote in favour of this report.</p>

The situation is very serious up in the north of the country. Part of the problem is that activity in large segments of the state sector – and the private sector too – is either ceasing altogether, or being curtailed. In two thirds of Sweden"s municipalities, the population has been on the decrease for several years now. And let us not forget that population densities were already very low beforehand, with three or four inhabitants per square kilometre. Many jobs in the interior are disappearing and local authority finances are extremely stretched. Regional policy is not proving very effective at all; in fact, it is rather ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the package Sweden negotiated when joining the EU, Norrland"s interior was granted special Objective 6 status. Objective 6 is now to be merged with Objective 1. Equally, Objective 5b – which covers rural and island areas – is to be absorbed into Objective 2. We hope that the new Objectives 1 and 2 will prove beneficial for the areas affected, so that the northern parts of Sweden – and of other EU countries – are spared still further depopulation and migration. There has been a call for Objectives 1 and 2 to be granted an adequate share of overall resources; we trust that there will be something positive in the package for the development of northern Sweden.</p>

This decision is particularly important for Dublin. I cannot be repeated often enough: in an otherwise very successful city there are pockets of enormous deprivation. The URBAN initiative will allow for projects to be undertaken in these areas to tackle the ingrained problems of long‐term unemployment and urban decay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, including the Irish Government, actually failed to reinstate this project. But we in Parliament had it reinstated. We succeeded there. This proves again how relevant Parliament is to ordinary people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my valedictory speech, Mr President. I want to thank you and all the Members and say what a pleasure it was to work here in this Parliament over the last five years. My colleague has spoken about the end; the end is nigh. I hope I will be back. We have a democracy in Ireland, a funny type of democracy: it decides who will be elected and who will not. We do not have a list system. Commissioner Flynn will appreciate that. I want to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission because in all the heated debates we have had nobody has stopped to thank those members of the Commission who have worked very hard for the people of Europe, the people we all here tried to represent. We have a very good line‐up of hard working Commissioners tonight.</p>

Political considerations have taken precedence over economic ones, including in the way we have formulated and implemented our strategy in regard to the applicant countries. We are delighted that pre‐accession aid has been principally focused on strengthening the administrative and institutional capacities of the relevant countries, including social dialogue, which is an important aspect of society in these countries. Democracy and states based on the rule of law form the basis of the European Union. They lie at its very heart and consist of much more than the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . There is a place for countries which seek to become based on the rule of law, but not for those that do not. This clear stance has been a major force for good. In Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic states it has been taken very seriously, even if it is not always easy to apply political criteria in practice. A good example of this is the position of the Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia.</p>
<p class="contents">Decentralisation as an objective belongs among the political and administrative criteria and the EU must keep to this. I therefore welcome the fact that the reports have specifically referred to this point. Where possible management must be transferred to the governments of the applicant countries, which are already involved through cofinancing. It is good that the European Union is sticking with the PHARE priorities in all of this, making them its own strategy. Part of this is also the attempt to get the applicant countries involved in European political union, which is gaining a higher profile because of the emphasis on political criteria. There are great differences between the applicant countries, Mr President. This is why the guidelines and multiannual programmes must be drawn up for each country and for each sector. It is each country"s own merits that count. However, it is not fair to constantly impose extra demands on applicants on the basis of our own national interests. I have in mind, for example, the resolution on the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, which is on the agenda this morning. Nuclear safety is important, but we cannot simply demand or pressurise countries to close down nuclear power stations as part of the accession process. The accession conditions cannot be used in order to settle bilateral scores.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in two years of negotiation for seven years of European regional aid, of course there are areas where we would have wished to go further: clearer commitments, the partnership by local and regional authorities, even further guarantees that payments will be made on time to those delivering projects, a specific figure for social risk capital for the smaller voluntary organisations to benefit. Nevertheless, our intentions are clear. I want to underline two parliamentary achievements in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">First, not only have we ensured that urban poverty and neglect are dealt with directly for the first time, but against all expectations we have retained an urban community initiative too, which can target the small‐ and medium‐sized towns which currently receive less than 10 % of the funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, whilst retaining a 5 % eligible population for poor rural areas, we have also succeeded in redirecting some CAP support from within Heading 1, off‐farm, and Heading 2, rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">My own region, Essex, in the east of England, has 18 urban wards in the 25 % most deprived in the UK. In the Cambridgeshire Fens, which have been part of the £50m 5‐B Programme across East Anglia, but where 73 % of villages have no food shops, 74 % no daily bus service and not one a bank, these decisions offer hope. But for Europe as a whole, it ensures that the needs of severe pockets of poverty and deprivation can be tackled alongside help to large regions suffering industrial decline. It is an agreement which we can welcome.</p>

Opinions may differ slightly on the individual points, but one aspect is clearly of overriding significance. The fact that we have kept to the timetable is an enormous advantage. It means that the review of the Structural Funds will be able to take effect in good time, in contrast to 1994, and that we will not be faced with a repeat of the dilemma we had five years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has from the outset declared itself in favour of reforming structural and regional aid, so that the financial resources available are concentrated on the regions in greatest need of development, but also so that greater individual responsibility is assigned to the Member States, particularly where entire regions are not eligible for EU structural aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the new Objective 1 regions receive 70 % of resources. This means that it is now possible to target support at specific regions. However, we regret not having managed to introduce a separate objective for rural development which we have been openly in favour of the whole time. We also regret that with regard to the possibilities for national involvement, the Member States will not be allowed to select Objective 2 regions which do not meet the strict criteria, but will still be limited by criteria and the Commission"s reserving the right to grant authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always urged that a regional GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the Community average be strictly applied as the criteria for the selection of future Objective 1 regions. This has been successful on the whole, even though in the meantime there has repeatedly been the danger of speaking out in favour of flexibility on this matter. Opinion is divided within my group as far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned. Some of my colleagues – particularly those from the southern European countries – support the Commission"s and Council"s proposal to continue with the Cohesion Fund in its present form. Others believe that for the countries which are taking part in monetary union, the Cohesion Fund has achieved its objective and has made a fundamental contribution to nominal convergence. There is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, not all dreams can come true. Wishes still remain to be fulfilled. However, the compromise as a whole is a step in the right direction for the next planning period.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elles </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, the last few weeks have been successful ones for the European Parliament in terms of our powers under the Amsterdam Treaty, the issue of discharge to have better control of Commission management and also, and not least, the vote on the Statute we took today to defer it to avoid some Council agreement being imposed on us. But what then of the financial perspectives?</p>
<p class="contents">There has been great progress and I would thank the German presidency for what it has done to add on to the financial perspectives vis‐à‐vis the Berlin Summit. We have made considerable progress, not least in classification and the way in which we can have conciliation across the whole of the budget. But for me, and many of my group, there remain some gaps in relation to the financial perspectives as they currently stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The first refers to the rigour – not in categories 1 and 2, but 3, 4 and 5 where there is ambiguity in some of the declarations, in some of the phraseology, which needs to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of flexibility, we have indeed lined up for rigour in the financial perspective, but where we see that there is very little scope for flexibility, where some of it has been absorbed by URBAN initiative under category 2 and where we have no means of being able to use what parliamentary powers we would have under Article 203, then that means for me that a rigid corset has been set for financial discipline which is inappropriate for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in this context, there is no general review clause of this financial perspective which is heading off for the next seven years with no fixed date for revision and so no possibility of this Parliament or the new Commission collectively reviewing it at a particular date, irrespective of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, there is a problem which I notice has just arisen. It comes from our own President. Mr President I should be grateful if you would investigate this because our President seems to be paying more attention to influences outside this House than to parliamentary rights, claiming that the vote on the financial perspective should be a simple majority, rather than a qualified majority, though the chairman of the Committee on Budgets actually said it should be done by a qualified majority. I would appreciate it if this could be clarified tomorrow, otherwise there will be vigorous opposition in this House to what will be apparently imposed upon it by the President.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, may I say that in terms of Parliament itself, I believe that we risk being without better flexibility and having this – what I would call – bureaucrat's dream of being able to spend money without having effective parliamentary control over a long period of time. We should continue to negotiate and come to a good deal with the Council as soon as we can, probably in the early autumn, alongside the agreements on the Statute. That way we will make sure that parliamentary rights are properly preserved and yet have continuity as we should in the budgetary process.</p>

<p class="contents">Loyola de Palacio concealed the fact that the extra 550 000 tonnes for the milk quota does not attract a premium, and for bovine animals the increases will not make up for the agreed reduction of 20 % in prices, thereby producing a fall in incomes in this sector of some 30 000 million pesetas.</p>

<p class="contents">By now everything has already been said at least once in the House on the subject which we are dealing with today. I would ask Mr Langen not to be tempted to heckle. However, one point has not been made, a point that in my opinion should be made, namely that we should rediscover the market economy if we want the people and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to one day fulfil the criteria for EU membership. If we are really showing or want to show solidarity, then it is not sufficient to hand out money. I know what I am talking about, since I come from a part of Germany which receives a considerable amount of funds from the European Union and western Germany. However, this alone is not sufficient. The principle of the market economy must be embraced wholeheartedly. If we really want to show solidarity, we must help the people of Central and Eastern Europe to rediscover this instrument. However, this means that we in the European Union first of all have to begin to actually embrace the market economy again ourselves. I am sure that you will not mind if I do not quite use up all of my two minutes" speaking time.</p>

I should therefore like to begin by sincerely thanking Parliament, the Commission and the Council for the work that they have done. Countless negotiating rounds had to be held in order to achieve an acceptable compromise. Parliament was actively involved throughout the entire process and was able to influence the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always declared our support for the further development of the common agricultural policy and of rural development policy. A radical course has been set for shaping the future European agricultural policy. This involves strengthening rural development policy as the second pillar of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of important environmental measures can still be pursued by means of this. Environmental measures for farmers can be safeguarded in the long term, and hill farmers and farmers in disadvantaged regions can be given greater support. I welcome the fact that the individual Member States have the opportunity to take part in the decision making. Certainly, the lowering of intervention prices for beef and cereals could not have been avoided, but it is due among other things to the commitment of the European Parliament that these were not reduced on the scale originally proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that agreement was not reached on the reforms in the milk sector. However, in terms of promoting disadvantaged regions, the decision to continue with the milk quota system, even beyond 2008, is of prime importance as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to matters which apply across the board, I certainly cannot agree to a degressive model of direct payments. In principle, I should like to say that the compromise already worked out by the Commission, the Council and Parliament has produced satisfactory results as far as I can see. On no account, however, should the outcome be jeopardised by the final vote which Parliament has yet to hold. It is now up to the individual Member States to use their room for manoeuvre as nation states as far as possible, and there are a number of possibilities for examining national peculiarities. These should also be taken into account for the benefit of our farmers, thereby creating and securing more jobs in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe"s farmers and thus our European cultural landscape must not be sacrificed in favour of the world market; instead, we are demanding fair conditions for European agriculture, and this also applies to future WTO negotiations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gillis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – I should also like to add my thanks to the Commission, to the Commissioners present, and all the others who have worked so hard during the period I have been in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the EPP group, can only note the result of the Berlin Summit and while it is a significant improvement on the original Commission proposal it falls far short of what is needed by producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The promise of full compensation for price cuts given in 1992 has not been honoured in Agenda 2000 decisions, and while farmers suffer much lower prices, the cost of the common agricultural policy continues to rise. More importantly, consumers continue to pay more and more for their food.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully realise the absolute requirement to make way for enlargement of the Union to the east and to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming WTO round. However, it is not acceptable that so many farmers are given no alternative but to withdraw from farming because of the impossibility of making a reasonable income. Rural depopulation is rife, in spite of all the rural development measures. As I have repeatedly said, without the core business of farming most rural development projects cannot be successful, because they cannot stand alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise it is difficult for colleagues from other Member States to realise how low farm incomes have fallen in my country, Ireland, mainly due to the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on export markets, both in the EU and in third countries. Ninety per cent of our total beef production and 80 % of our milk production is exported. The BSE crisis in the UK has almost ruined our export markets. As consumption falls sharply and other countries rely on their own production without importing, the collapse of the Russian economy has further weakened a fragile market.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on agricultural reform, while an improvement on the original Commission proposals, are not a long‐term solution. If we are serious about protecting the European model of agriculture, with all its constraints and additional costs, and if we are serious about maintaining the rural countryside we must return to prices which are in some way based on, or linked to, the cost of production. Do we want a vibrant, living, well‐maintained countryside or do we want a giant national park without people – and especially without young people? I believe that is where Agenda 2000 proposals will take us unless we make changes without delay.</p>

At Parliament"s first reading on the European Social Fund, I recognised that the orientation of the programme will have a great effect on the objectives and regions in question. Nearly all the amendments we tabled have been included by the rapporteur. The ESF is still basically orientated towards labour market policies, and the PPE has placed special emphasis on this. Fund support only makes sense if the results of the projects are sustainable and they actually reach the target populations as well. The PPE agrees with the common position on the ESF.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see the new ESF swiftly and smoothly implemented within the next year, without further loss of time and guaranteeing prompt and reliable planning for those responsible for the projects and for the Member States. For this reason, we absolutely reject a third reading and will be voting against all the amendments which would result in this. As shadow rapporteur, I would be able to support the amendments which have arisen as a compromise from the negotiations within the Council if the Council and the Commission confirmed that the amendments in question would in fact be adopted and the danger of a third reading therefore did not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe expect us to support development in their regions, and to do so by means of speedy and practical measures which are not bureaucratic. We are placing a fund into the hands of the Member States in question, and they should not encumber or hinder it by laying down additional rules; instead, they can use it in a way which is genuinely in line with the objectives.</p>

It is not really appropriate, but I will now move on to the subject of the organisation of the market in wine. We have heard that there are certainly many things to find fault with in the part of the Agenda 2000 package that deals with agricultural policy. We must praise the Commission, the Council presidency, Mr Funke, and also Parliament for the progress made in one area; Mr Fischler, you took a long time to put forward such a good proposal, and you refused to withdraw the old one for a long time. Together we have managed to reform the organisation of the market in wine reasonably well, and I believe that after holding a debate like this one, we should not only voice criticism, but we should also give praise. It is sad that there is no wine here for those attending the last evening sitting of this parliamentary term. Mr Funke was certainly present when the former Federal Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced his watchword for the future wine‐growing policy on German National Wine Day: we must drink more. A quotation from the past!</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to get back to the point. We have pushed through Parliament"s demands in this reform of the wine market, and I can only emphasise here once again that it would be a good thing if Parliament were able to take part in the decision‐making in the future, since we have mastered horse‐trading in this House just as well as the Council. What has come out of the organisation of the market in wine is in any case praiseworthy. Corrections have been made to the regulations on distillation and the rights for planting new vines. The Member States have greater individual responsibility. It is now possible to set up inter‐branch organisations throughout the whole of Europe. The reform includes programmes financed by the EU for restructuring, switching to different varieties, and modernisation of production techniques. The Council retains its powers. After all, we do not want to give the Commission too many powers, for instance over regulations on labelling and oenological practices. We must therefore preserve the traditional growing methods in Europe. Mr Fischler has also recognised and actively supported this. We are therefore satisfied with the reform, and I think that the broad agreement on the organisation of the market in wine has been a great achievement for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Only those who know of the dispute that has taken place in the last five years within Parliament over the issue of the organisation of the market in wine are in a position to appreciate how much progress has been made. I should like to thank you all, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to drink to this outcome with a glass of wine in the next parliamentary term, if not this evening.</p>

The Union"s structural policy plays an important role in supplementing development at national level. Just as important as how much aid the Union can afford to give is the question of how aid is used. The Member States have the ultimate responsibility for acting wisely. Regional policy administered according to the principle of transparency will also boost the confidence of the public in the work of the Union and how achievable results can be.</p>
<p class="contents">EU structural policy resources must be targeted on investment in the creation of genuine jobs. The bottom line must be safeguarding employment and welfare in different parts of the continent. Regional development policy has to be all‐embracing, motivating, and it must promote enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">The final decision on Agenda 2000 is a good European compromise. The fact that talks led to results in a situation in which the Commission had already resigned is proof of the viability of the Union. The Union can congratulate itself on the introduction of a package of reforms.</p>

Let us leave aside the many positive aspects. As I believe that it is always possible to mitigate negative factors, let me highlight three of them. First, the reform of the common agricultural policy, which I regard as being a poor reflection of the concept of rural development, as in the end both the winners and the losers will be the same as before. Secondly, the reduction in public participation in private revenue‐generating projects, which, as it penalises companies, will also have an adverse effect on jobs. And thirdly, the concentration of funding under the next Community support framework in the earlier years, which, taken together with the normal flow of funds, will make accessing the Structural Funds a complex business, whilst funds that are not taken up will be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these general factors, there is another which I consider to be of crucial importance, namely the absence of practical recognition for the ultra‐peripheral regions. After years of work to have them included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, it makes me very bitter to see that they have been ignored in Agenda 2000.</p>

For here we are at a quarter to eleven in the evening, with Parliament still in full session and even the Council still present, on which I congratulate you, Mr President‐in‐Office, as I have never before seen the Council remain in Parliament until a quarter to eleven in the evening.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now been busy for more than a year with the reform of the Structural Funds for the next term. It is now high time to give our final verdict, as otherwise the projects are not going to be able to start on time and I strongly oppose any postponement. I am therefore pleased to learn, as I did earlier today, that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a number of amendments to the European Social Fund which were threatening to lead to postponement.</p>
<p class="contents">In November I argued for the Community"s URBAN initiative to be continued, as the small and medium‐sized towns which lie outside the objective areas, areas which are weak and ailing, also have their problems. I also argued for a new Community initiative designed to provide a flexible response to unexpected serious economic crises. In the Euroland era we need such a device, if you compare it to what you find in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament supported both initiatives, but the Council wanted just three and we already had three. So there were two too many. However, the Treaty amendments from the Amsterdam summit made it compulsory to take clear account of Parliament"s views and we fortunately reached a compromise. URBAN and RESTRUCT were combined to form the new URBAN. The European Regional Fund will in future help solve the economic and social problems of towns and neighbourhoods in a state of crisis with a view to promoting sustainable development. I am pleased about this, and it would be a welcome development if the Commission could now find a little more money somewhere to spend on this initiative. I have already heard details of the new allocation, Commissioner, and thank you for giving the innovative measures greater scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, perhaps I could make just one final comment to the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the 1997 Structural Funds discharge I should like to draw your attention to the fact that a country such as the Netherlands constantly comes out badly in the reports of the Court of Auditors, precisely because it adopts a more exact manner of reporting than all the other countries. Could you not take a look at these systems, so that this does not always come across so badly in the news coverage?</p>

<p class="contents">Today we are listening to proposals to make us condemn the interinstitutional agreement, thus leaving us without a financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, taking account of the latest negotiations and the flexibility accepted by the Council, I do not feel that the budget cut agreed on in Berlin justifies seriously endangering the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Unless there are final agreements between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I am afraid that the only thing we are doing is promoting euroscepticism.</p>

I will concede this, Mr Funke, but the fishing industry is a relatively weak sector of the European economy and requires special treatment, especially as there are mostly no alternative forms of employment in the regions dependent on fishing. Even our original demand for a separate Objective 4 for rural development with separate treatment for the regions dependent on fishing did not gain acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, therefore, the same measures will be funded by different sources in the different Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions, with Objective 1 regions clearly being in a better position. As a result, there is the threat of companies in the new Objective 2 regions moving into the Objective 1 regions solely because they will find better conditions and support there. Where I live in Cuxhaven‐Bremerhaven, there is the threat of just this kind of sword of Damocles; such distortion of competition must not be the result of European structural policy. Mr Funke, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, I think there are still some important things we need to do here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by thanking all those who helped to ensure that we continue to have an independent Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament. For this reason I am looking forward to the new parliamentary term.</p>

In the past, dictatorships were always given preferential treatment in terms of accession to the European Union if they were able to make their governmental structure a democratic one and found a way of doing this. If this was the case in the past, then it should certainly remain so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hatzidakis pointed out in his speech that along with the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe we also have an island in the Mediterranean. He was talking about Cyprus, which is also thinking of joining the EU. I should like to include a further Mediterranean island in the discussion, namely Malta. Neither of these islands comes under the preparatory pre‐accession measures which apply to the other countries. However, like Cyprus, Malta is important geographically, and it has a stable democracy. It is true that both countries have been granted an extension of one year for the fourth financial protocol, but the structures are not in place for a pre‐accession phase. If we are thinking of a kind of mini PHARE, then I would urge the Commission at some point in the near future to demonstrate to the applicant countries the perspectives under which they can approach their pre‐accession phase, so that they obtain the same degree of specific planning criteria as the others, since those of us from the large EU Member States in particular should feel responsible for the small applicant countries.</p>

We can now see the results of this. In my view the winners are: the Member States in the Cohesion Fund, in particular the three which we believe should in fact no longer have been eligible; the Objective 1 regions that receive an even greater amount of funds than has so far been the case in the urban areas covered by the new Objective 2, which still even receive funds from the Community initiative URBAN; and the applicant countries which I only hope will not become a market economy, as Mr Schröder said, but a social market economy.</p>

<p class="contents">The losers are definitely the rural areas and especially the regions bordering with third countries. When I look at the Commissioners sitting there at the front, it is clear to me why the regions bordering with third countries were not particularly taken into account. They do not come from these areas.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Three kilometres from the border regions, I have been told! Commissioner, the unemployment criterion, which we argued about for a long time, still accounts for 50 %. Soft criteria are only 50 %. The problem with this is that the number of unemployed might not be very high, but the infrastructure and the number of skilled jobs might not be adequate either, and young people who are well qualified then move away from the area or commute. This is not everything. Capping agricultural expenditure – Mr Fischler referred to this himself today – is obviously an important issue that has to be viewed as negative. This will naturally result in even less money being made available in rural areas in the future, particularly in the areas where it is urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have no wish to conceal how positive it is that we now have a safety net in the former Objective 5b regions, as well time‐limits for transitional periods – it was not certain we would have them – and that the Community initiatives, Interreg and Leader, are better provided for than before. We must be fair and admit this. I think that we will also benefit from EQUAL.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the financial perspectives, I feel that it is crucial for the European Parliament to approve the framework defined in Berlin. If not, we will be responsible for enormous confusion and instability in the management of Community policies and we could even distort the fundamental options under Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the CAP, I must stress that the final agreement reached in Berlin was far better than the Brussels agreement. Nevertheless, the Berlin agreement was still a long way removed from the position adopted by the European Parliament. It failed to restore a proper balance to the CAP in terms of fairness and cohesion, and the less‐favoured and peripheral regions are still threatened by depopulation and desertification. It also failed to create practical conditions for applying the European farming model and to establish the prerequisites for the European Union to go on the offensive in the forthcoming WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Portugal is concerned, I deeply regret that some of my country's key specific problems were not taken into consideration. First, the effects of enlargement were not considered, although it is well known that the Portuguese economy is by far the most vulnerable to competition from our future partners. Second, the specific nature of Portuguese agriculture was not recognised, and the various kinds of production quotas were not extended, although Portugal is the country with the greatest deficit in the European Union, nor was any consideration given to increasing irrigation quotas, which would be invaluable given that in Portugal, which has the most backward agricultural sector in the European Union, irrigation has an essential part to play in modernising agriculture.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I want to confine my remarks to the report by Mr Arias Cañete on structural measures in the fisheries sector. In devising structural measures in this sector for the new millennium the overriding objective should be to keep them as simple and as cohesive as possible, to ensure that they are flexible enough to respond to the specific regional needs of fisheries and areas dependent on fisheries or where there are significant fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The original proposals of the Commission on structural measures were, to say the least, complex and in some places certainly could not be considered cohesive. For example, a proposal for the same measure to be financed from the FIFG for Objective 1 and 2 regions but from the EAGGF Guarantee Section for other regions could only encourage ‘fund chasing", whereby fishing enterprises might relocate within the Community just simply to avail of funds for their particular project. If ever there was a recipe for regional dislocation and discrimination against traditional local industries likely to create unnecessary unemployment in the fishing sector, this was it.</p>
<p class="contents">Contradictions in the Commission proposals for the restructuring of the fleet which is subject to the rules of the MAGP, which require national programming, compared to Objective 2 regions, which are subject to regional programming, would only serve to confuse other matters. The less favourable redefinition of coastal areas in Objective 2 from areas depending on fishing and in Objective 1 which would eliminate areas distant from the coast requiring structural funds to support aquaculture and processing has to be resisted and changed, as this is clearly discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I must welcome the Commission's decision to reverse its proposal to require fishermen to purchase an additional 30 % tonnage, which, if it had gone ahead, could only have been described as a penal law, designed to hinder the urgent need for modernisation and renewal of the fleet. The case to drop this proposal was forcibly pressed by Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and the unanimous view played no small part in reversing this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to place on record my support for the Union's fishery sector to have a single cohesive structural policy. It is essential to guarantee that all regions with fishing communities continue to have improved access to fishery structural funds without any attempt to reduce the levels of funding or restrict or exclude access through increasing complexity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nicholson </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – Mr President, there is no doubt that Agenda 2000 will bring tremendous change to the European Union, be it in agriculture or be it in regional policy. On regional policy I have to admit that I am extremely disappointed that Northern Ireland does not retain Objective I. But I want to pay tribute to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly for their support for me, and to the Council and Commission because I believe we have achieved a deal that we can live with and will be good for Northern Ireland in the long term. I am content with that. It is a compromise – a compromise that was a good one for my region. But I feel there is a real need to refocus, to relocate and reconsider and attain objectives that we have not been able to attain before: that is to ensure that we have not only got value for money but we also leave something positive behind where European money has been concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">On agriculture the proposals will not improve the position of my farmers. It is a very difficult position that agriculture faces at the moment, not only in my own region but right throughout the whole of Europe. Low income has been a tremendous problem. But we in Europe must defend the principle of the family farm and must not allow others in the rest of the world to import into our area food that does not meet our standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my last contribution in this Parliament, but I have every hope of returning to a future Parliament. I want to thank you, Mr President, the Parliament services and the Commissioners. I understand that on Friday I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to Northern Ireland. I understand I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies to Northern Ireland before the election period is over. I am sorry I am not going to be able to welcome Commissioner Fischler to Northern Ireland before the election is over, but if he wants to change his mind he would be very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a great pleasure not only to be a Member of this Parliament, but over the past ten year I have found that Parliament has done tremendous work. And I say to you, Mr President, thank you very much indeed. While at times you get criticism – we all get criticism, so what! You have been a good President.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – Thank you Mr Nicholson for your kind words. We have arrived at the end of a marathon debate on Agenda 2000. More than 80 colleagues spoke, even if for a very short time. I had every sympathy. Although I tried to be a bit hard because of the lack of time, we are still half‐an‐hour behind schedule, which means that we are going to go well over midnight. I would like to thank all the participants, firstly the President‐in‐Office of the Council. A colleague remarked earlier that it is rather rare that a President‐in‐Office sits so late at night to listen exhaustedly to an exhaustive debate. Naturally the Commissioners have been more accustomed to sit with us until very late.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is closed.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 am.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
