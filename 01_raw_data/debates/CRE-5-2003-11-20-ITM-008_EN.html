<p class="contents">The decision by the Indonesian authorities to extend martial law and carry out a military crackdown is deeply regrettable, and there has been very heavy-handed military action. An estimated 45 000 troops have been sent into the province against 5000 rebels. As ever in these situations, it is the civilian population which is paying the price, with reports of disruption to food supplies, infrastructure and schools being destroyed. Tens of thousands of civilians are reportedly displaced.</p>
<p class="contents">These are only estimates, of course, because the Indonesian authorities are not allowing observers in to monitor the situation. This has to stop. There is no point in the Indonesian Government complaining when the international community, the United States, the EU and Japan, draft a resolution expressing their concern if they in turn are not prepared to allow international monitors in and are not prepared to allow humanitarian organisations into their country to bring assistance to the civilian population. Our joint resolution makes a series of demands on the Indonesian Government and I hope very much that it is listening and that it will heed those concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to get both parties back to the negotiating table as quickly as possible. Time and time again we hear people telling us that military action is the answer, that it will be a quick military action and that once it is over everything will be sorted out. We have heard this so often, but often been disappointed. So often we have seen a high price paid in human lives. So both sides, the GAM and the Indonesian Government, must get back to the negotiating table, stop the fighting and resume the talking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the Commission for what it is already doing as regards Indonesia, particularly Commissioner Patten, who has always taken up issues about Aceh when we have asked him to do so. I hope the Council and the Commission will now do everything possible to assist Indonesia in getting back to the negotiating table with GAM and get those talks started as soon as possible. This is a matter of some urgency and I am very grateful to colleagues in this Parliament for agreeing to have today's debate and for supporting this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She also pleaded with them not to let a single drop of the people’s blood stain the earth. Today, Aceh is in a state of emergency. Violent military operations are under way, and people are being displaced, killed and raped. There is no access to the province, and emergency aid is being delivered, contrary to all international standards, by the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Concern about the population of Aceh should be growing for several reasons. In May, the message was that the insurgents would be defeated before long. After a six-months’ offensive, 40% of the people are living under the poverty line. Now, the state of emergency has, moreover, been extended, and the government has begun to speak about a lengthy war, perhaps of another ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Aceh is naturally complicated, involving as it does diametrically opposed political visions, competition for gas and oil resources and a population that, for a long time, has been denied the autonomy promised during the war of independence. Support for the separatists cannot, now or in the future, be crushed by the military operations. On the contrary, the military’s violent infringements of human rights will lead to still greater support for the insurgents. I fear that both parties’ armed forces believe that they can escape unpunished from their misdeeds when independent observers are unable to gain access to Aceh. Especially worrying are the latest rumours that a military group suspected of having committed systematic human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, together with a group of soldiers from the Indonesian army charged with, or convicted or suspected of, serious human rights abuses are now also active in Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the most worrying signals for the Indonesian Government. It is therefore crucially important that access to Aceh be given absolutely top priority internationally and in the EU’s dialogue with Mrs Megawati. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is very worrying and this climate of violence throughout the province risks ending up in another diabolical spiral. Since the end of May, the Indonesian military have arrested or killed almost two thousand people suspected of belonging to the GAM rebel group, a movement that demands autonomy for Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this spiral of violence, we call on the Indonesian Government and the pro-independence movement to resume negotiations in order to implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement. The populations that are at risk must be protected and Indonesia must quickly re-establish genuine dialogue so as to put an end to this unnecessary fighting, which leads to serious injustices and paves the way for the death of innocent people and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In Aceh, where the security forces have for many years been present in large numbers and have been murdering citizens with complete impunity, the climate is getting worse every day and is further reducing the confidence of the province’s inhabitants. The Indonesian Government’s passive attitude to the thousands of violations reported in Aceh, the majority of which have been committed by its own security forces as part of the anti-insurrectionist operations in recent years, has fuelled the people’s resentment and created conditions likely to strengthen violent opposition. The hope of lasting peace in Aceh will never be fulfilled unless steps are taken to protect the civilian population from the human rights violations. Today, we call on the Indonesian authorities, but also the ASEAN countries, the Council and the Commission to ensure that Jakarta makes every effort to defuse the situation in the region and that the flagrant human rights violations are strongly condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that the GAM will also have to cooperate in any investigation carried out into the human rights infringements attributed to its members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a debate about the escalating humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, most of Aceh's 4.2 million people live outside the two main towns. For them food, water, electricity and communications have been disrupted. Healthcare and education have become impossible. Five hundred schools have been burnt down, thousands of people have fled from their homes and Governor Puteh has said that unemployment and poverty are now at alarming rates.</p>
<p class="contents">We worry about human rights and I raise two issues. One is the fact that 77 community heads have been replaced by military personnel and the second is that active in Aceh are people like Major General Damiri, Brigadier General Suratman and others who have been convicted of crimes against humanity in East Timor. They are on duty in Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">Kofi Annan has appealed to Indonesia to ensure access to humanitarian aid and human rights organisations. He is right. The obstacles to this are in Presidential Decree 43/2003, which states that international and local NGOs are not allowed to conduct activities contrary to the objectives of the military emergency conditions. That is a catch-all provision that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. It is not acceptable that all aid has to be rooted through the Indonesian authorities, nor that NGOs are restricted to Banda Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call on Indonesia to investigate with urgency the disappearance of the human rights defender Abdussalam Deli, and the killing of his colleague, Raja Ismail. I hope the Commission and the Council will assist us in these aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation deteriorated even further after the breakdown in May of the fragile Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the establishment of a state of emergency by the Indonesian Government and the closure of the province.</p>
<p class="contents">The imposition of martial law led this House to adopt, in June, an initial resolution, in which we denounced the lack of freedom for the people and of freedom of the press. We expressed our concern regarding the fresh upsurge of violence, the daily murders and the increase in the number of arrests and disappearances.</p>
<p class="contents">This condemnation was not sufficient, as martial law has just been extended for six months. We regard this decision as unacceptable. Our main concern, however, relates to the closing-off of the region and the fact that it is impossible to gain access to the people, and particularly the victims of the conflict, because when there is a state of emergency the military governs the region and distributes the humanitarian aid. We call on the Indonesian Government to respect international military law and to allow humanitarian organisations access to the area so that they can provide assistance to the refugees, displaced persons and prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about the radicalisation of the conflict and the marginalisation of civil society campaigners at a time when moderate critical voices are needed to move towards peace and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">With the hope of re-establishing dialogue, on behalf of the human rights group of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I organised, in October, a discussion on the critical situation in Atjeh and Papua. Unfortunately, the Indonesian Government’s failure to face the separatist movements and civil society representatives prevented us from making any progress in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, it is all too clear that the fall of the Suharto dictatorship and the return to democracy in Indonesia have not been accompanied by a significant improvement in human rights. In reality, the army is still in power. Civil liberties, trade union freedom and the freedom of expression continue to be scorned. The tragedy in East Timor does not appear to have served as an example for the Government in view of the demands for autonomy that are coming from Borneo, the Moluccas, Atjeh and Papua. There is no doubt that the rise in fundamentalism and in the number of terrorist attacks that are in the headlines of the international press are of grave concern, but it is in the name of national unity and the fight against terrorism where, far from the view of the media, freedoms are treated with contempt every day and a savage repression rages, not only in Atjeh but also in Papua.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we do not support the armed rebellions, we call on the Indonesian Government to engage in dialogue with the fighters in order to build peace, and we call on the European Union to promote the reconciliation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, we are now seeing the result of the conquest of Aceh by the Netherlands a century or more ago. Peoples that have been assigned to large, powerful neighbours run the risk of becoming second- or third-class citizens for good, without access to leading positions, without the possibility of active political participation and without having their natural resources at their disposal. These peoples can only be protected by a large degree of self-government or by secession. The more armies are deployed to prevent such a possible secession by means of terror, the more hated they make themselves, and the more difficult reconciliation between the ruling and the other peoples becomes. This is how the breeding ground for those secession movements grows.</p>
<p class="contents">In Indonesia, the failing government is striving for popularity among the Javanese by showing that it is dealing with other population groups firmly and giving the army free rein. That is comparable with the situation in Sri Lanka we discussed in an earlier agenda item. The President needs this war to keep herself in power. Negotiations are alternated with forceful military intervention. Refugees from Aceh have told me how hopeless the situation has become. Anyone who was present at the peace talks in Japan can no longer safely enter Indonesia. In East Timor, we saw the devastating consequences of this kind of policy on the part of a previous president.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must not resign itself to the current hopeless situation, and it must not put trade relations with Indonesia, particularly the supplies of arms that were resumed in 2001, above human rights. This is an alarming situation, and must lead to our ensuring that the autonomy and emancipation of the peoples of Indonesia have their place, and that there is no military victory, oppression or uprooting of these peoples.</p>

<p class="contents">The situation in the province is obviously a matter of concern for the Commission, and in a recent statement the European Union presidency and the Commission, as co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference on peace and reconstruction in Aceh, voiced their concern about the extension of the state of military emergency in the province. We also expressed the hope that it will end as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is seeking to encourage the government of Indonesia to suspend martial law as soon as possible, and in the meantime has impressed upon it the need to carry out its activities with the minimum possible impact on the well-being of the people of Aceh. In pursuing such a process we always include references to humanitarian aid, the restoration of civil institutions and respect for the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also pressing for improvement in the transparency of the situation in Aceh and continues to call, as honourable Members have, for access to Aceh for international agencies and relevant non-governmental humanitarian organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission reiterates its commitment to the territorial integrity of Indonesia, it is also firmly convinced that the conflict in Aceh can only be ended by political means. Despite the difficulties of obtaining reliable and verifiable information, our delegation in Jakarta is closely monitoring developments in the province in coordination with Member State missions to Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">It regrets that a recently planned mission to Aceh by political councils from several embassies was cancelled at the last moment by the Indonesian authorities. The Commission will monitor the situation very closely and continue its efforts to impress upon the Indonesian authorities that they should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and, in the meantime, allow independent humanitarian aid providers to operate in Aceh without hindrance.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause of decency and humanity is well served by the interest demonstrated by this House, especially in the way in which honourable Members were able to illustrate their concern and arguments by reference to the reality of the wretchedness inflicted on the people of Aceh. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
