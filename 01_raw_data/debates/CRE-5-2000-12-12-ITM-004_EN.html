<p class="contents">You are all familiar with our aims. I discussed them in this Chamber on 4 July. I think that we have been able to fulfil our commitments, although you will be the judges of that. I am also aware that this outcome certainly owes a great deal to the contribution made by the European Parliament. I have just returned from Nice after four days of intense negotiations, led by my Prime Minister and the members of his government. Today I join you, the representatives of the European peoples, to tell you the results of the Intergovernmental Conference on institutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The stakes were high and we feel satisfied that we reached an agreement that would have been impossible three years ago. We feel satisfied that we overcame the difficulties blocking the path towards the much sought-after aim of fulfilling the commitments that were given at Helsinki to the candidate countries without destroying the Union, of enabling tomorrow’s Europe to continue to function effectively. I think I can say that we met these conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite aware that the Treaty of Nice does not fulfil all of the European Parliament’s desires, but I do believe that this treaty is the best agreement possible, given the existing constraints. It responds to the challenge we were presented with, which was to provide the Union with the ability to take decisions and to act once Europe has gone ahead with enlargement on an unprecedented scale. It is a balanced agreement and although the negotiations were tough, as you know, there were neither winners nor losers.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amsterdam, three and a half years ago, it proved impossible to achieve the tricky balance between being representative and being effective. We were able to achieve this at Nice, as a result of the efforts made by all the Member States. It must be said that some agreed to make more of an effort than others and we must pay tribute to them for that. We must also pay tribute to the European spirit, which finally enabled us to leave Nice having resolved those issues left over from Amsterdam and having paved the way for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As we promised, there are no leftovers from Nice. We were concerned that the Commission should remain a strong institution within the Union, capable of making ambitious proposals. In deciding to abolish a second Commissioner, and in deciding on a varying upper limit for the number of Commissioners when there are less than 27, with a scrupulously fair system of rotation, the Treaty of Nice guarantees both the Commission’s task of embodying the interests of the Union and also its effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">This effectiveness will also be achieved by means of the new powers that have been given to the President, who will now be elected by qualified majority, which constitutes real progress. I know that Parliament considered the number of areas in which qualified majority voting will apply to be one of the priorities of these negotiations. This also proved to be one of the thorniest issues, but progress was made. I am talking about real progress, even if it does not go as far as the presidency – which, I should point out, has shown great openness at national level – would have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">When you consider the results of the Nice Summit, I would ask you not to underestimate what has been achieved. Thirty or so additional measures were switched to qualified majority voting and we made progress on justice and home affairs, external trade and cohesion, all chapters about which several Member States had major reservations at the beginning of the negotiations. The presidency regretted the fact that the same consensus could not be achieved in the fields of taxation and social affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement reached on the issue of the number of Member States’ votes within the Council is a balanced one. Reweighting was made necessary by enlargement, but it also takes account of the legitimate concern to see Member States with a smaller population continuing to make their full contribution to the workings of the Union, a contribution that is crucial. I would add that the democratic legitimacy of the Council’s decisions will be guaranteed and that the Council will be able to function properly. The mechanisms that are implemented, be they the demographic verification clause or the so-called “majority of States” clause, will not affect the Union’s decision-making abilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to one of the most positive outcomes of the IGC. This concerns the procedure for enhanced cooperation, which has, to a large extent, been made possible under the first and third pillars. This cooperation will always be open to everyone. It will, of course, take place in full respect of Community legislation and the institutional framework. By making this cooperation more flexible, however, we are enabling it to be used properly. This therefore provides us with a guarantee that Europe will be able, no matter what happens, to forge ahead rapidly. The opening up of enhanced cooperation under the second pillar is also a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also highlight the fact that this IGC resulted in an extension of the powers and competences of the European Parliament. The new mechanism provided for in Article 7 on the warning procedure in the field of fundamental rights gives a major role to your institution. A new legal basis has been laid down for the status of European political parties and Parliament has been given the status of institutional plaintiff laid down under Article 230 of the Treaty. These are notable advances, even though I acknowledge that progress in extending codecision falls short of your expectations, and of those of the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in addition to the IGC, the need was felt to engage in a rigorous debate on a few issues that are crucial to the future of the European Union. The further ahead Europe moves, the greater duty we have to strengthen its democratic legitimacy, the clarity and transparency of its institutions and to clarify the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States. Only by so doing will Europe be able to respond to the aspirations of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to achieving these objectives, a study on the future of Europe will be carried out, as decided by the European Council. The European Parliament will, of course, be closely involved in this. This study should be concluded in 2004. We will thereby be responding to the concerns that have been expressed very forcefully in recent times. This process will by no means constitute a precondition for enlargement and will therefore not delay this project. These are, in short, the results of the institutional work carried out in Nice. They will take Europe forward and I am delighted that the candidate countries have welcomed them so positively over the last few days. This positive response bears witness to the fact that we have met their expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, enlargement is clearly the major issue facing Europe today. It is both a huge challenge and an historic milestone on the path towards the reunification of our continent. The French Presidency has lent all its support to the progress of the negotiations. Thirty new chapters were closed, including some in the most complex areas of Community legislation, and some countries, which have only just entered into negotiations, are already demonstrating their ability to catch up with the longer-standing candidates. In Nice, on the basis of the excellent work carried out by the Commission, we gave ourselves a travel permit for the next eighteen months. This is proof that the Union intends to forge ahead. This is a powerful signal, which was given a very positive welcome at the meeting of the European Conference last Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last six months, Europe has also made progress in the field of growth and employment. We have continued to deepen economic and monetary union, we have improved the coordination of our economic policies within the Eurogroup and have speeded up our joint preparation for the entry of the euro into the daily life of the European public. In the last three weeks, progress has been made in three major areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the conclusion of the long-standing and difficult negotiations on the tax package, including savings tax and, secondly, the adoption of the European Social Agenda following a lengthy consultation procedure, particularly with our social partners. The Union has thereby given itself a working programme that sets objectives and meetings for the next five years in the fields of employment law, social protection, mobility, lifelong training and the fight against discrimination and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the adoption, not without difficulty, of the social chapter for European society took place at Nice. This is the culmination of a project that dates back thirty years. The French Presidency is delighted to have been able to unravel the threads of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the Union has begun to implement the Feira decisions on the new economy and growth. We agreed on a significant lowering of Internet access costs. This has been done. The Union decided to divide up access to the local loop. We wanted to introduce a Community patent and the Union has given a commitment to establishing one and is including the necessary legal measures in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, France’s ambition for its presidency was also to respond to the concerns of the European public. In Nice, we proclaimed the Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, a text of very great political importance. Its significance will be assessed in the future and I wish to pay tribute to your Parliament which contributed so greatly to its drafting. As a result of this Charter, our Union will be stronger and have greater guarantees of the values of dignity, freedom and solidarity that are its cornerstones. We shall now echo this as widely as possible and very shortly consider its status. I realise how much importance your Parliament attaches to this Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Under this presidency, the Union has also given a new boost to cultural and student life in Europe. Two months ago, our Education Ministers adopted an action plan for mobility – a forty-two point action plan – and we agreed on a substantial allocation of EUR 400 million for the Media-Plus programme, which is so important for European cinema and audiovisual services and which – as you will be aware – the whole profession was hoping for.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you remember that I mentioned in this very Chamber France’s desire to ensure that the Union took greater account of the specific characteristics of sport and its social function. This is the purpose of the declaration adopted at Nice and of the study that has been commissioned to coordinate the fight against doping at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to instil the adventure of European integration in people’s hearts we must also ensure that this union that we are building keeps its human face. We must preserve the things to which every citizen is legitimately attached: a familiar environment, the balance of our territories, and a good quality of life, by which I mean services of general economic interest. The presidency welcomes the fact that the discussion started within the Commission and the Council led to the adoption in Nice of a declaration that emphasises the crucial role of these services in maintaining Europe’s social and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the course of the past six months, the presidency has firmly committed itself to making Europe respond better to the security needs of our citizens. The presidency has one ambition, which is to be more protective, in the best sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">In Nice, therefore, we laid the foundations for an independent food safety authority. The consequences of the mad cow epidemic are, of course, on everyone’s mind. What was needed first and foremost was to re-establish consumer confidence by means of immediate measures, which were vigorously advocated by France and adopted at the last Agricultural Council, such as the ban on meat meal in animal feedingstuffs and the widespread use of screening tests for BSE. Nor should we forget breeders and all the professions in the cattle industry that have been profoundly affected by this crisis and we have clearly highlighted this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is also on everyone’s mind is maritime safety. A year ago, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> ran aground off the French coast and despite the amazing mobilisation of charities and the authorities, the coast is still suffering the consequences of this shipwreck. A few weeks ago, the chemicals tanker, the <span class="italic">Ievolo Sun</span>, sank just off the Channel Islands. There must be no more occurrences of this type of disaster, which is caused by human negligence.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few months, the study of the Commission’s excellent proposals has made considerable progress. Your Parliament gave a firm commitment, on 30 November, to a preliminary package of measures which, next week, will be submitted once again to our Transport Ministers. The Swedish Presidency, one of whose priorities, I would remind you, is the environment, now has the task of concluding the second batch of proposals, which includes in particular, the creation of a European maritime safety agency. As a quite exceptional case and in view of the urgency of the situation, the Nice Council urged the Member States to implement, in advance and as a preliminary stage, the aspects of this mechanism which will be subject to a political agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone knows, another threat we face is global warming. At the Hague, the European Union rallied together to reach a credible and effective agreement, in line with the urgency and the importance of the issue. We were able to demonstrate our coherence on the Kyoto commitments. We will ceaselessly continue our efforts to convince our partners to commit themselves too. Next year, we are due to conclude an agreement which will finally stipulate the necessary reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also made progress in the fight against organised crime: we now have a directive on the fight against money-laundering, concerted action has been taken against non-cooperating countries and territories identified by the Financial Action Task Force, Europol’s competences have been extended to the fight against dirty money and a European Police College has been created. These are the main aspects of a coherent and broad range of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the backdrop against which the provisional judicial cooperation unit “Eurojust” was created, foreshadowing the body for judicial cooperation in criminal matters whose creation, due to take place next year, is already included in the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Finally, the French Presidency fostered an international ambition for Europe, a long-term ambition, which was to give the Union the means to assert itself in major world affairs, to have its voice heard and to be able to act. This is the draft common foreign and defence policy. The French Presidency also fostered a more immediate ambition, which was to show straightaway the political determination of the Fifteen to assert their own interests when European issues are at stake, and I am thinking here of south-eastern Europe in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these two aims, we have indeed made progress. First of all, at Nice we concluded the round of negotiations begun at the Cologne and Helsinki European Councils. We set objectives for ourselves and they were achieved. A year ago, we defined the military capabilities that the European Union should have by 2003 in order to be able to prevent and manage the type of crises envisaged by the Treaty. The Member States then committed themselves to providing a contribution in terms of armed forces and military resources. In addition to the troops themselves, the European Union will have the necessary resources for command, planning and intelligence gathering to lead complex joint army operations. The Union intends to use this military wing in complete harmony with NATO facilities and, if necessary, with their support. By making itself stronger, Europe will clearly be strengthening the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, at Nice, the European Union established the permanent bodies necessary to define and conduct a common foreign and security policy, which are: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European defence staff. The decision was taken to include the creation of the political and social committee in the Treaty, as this is the real mainstay of the system. Through delegation, the committee will be given decision-making powers when crisis management so requires. The revision of the Treaty on this point confirms the importance and the irreversible nature of the decisions taken in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">We were also concerned, even before these bodies were created, that the Union should have a greater say on the major international issues affecting its interests. First of all, with regard to south-eastern Europe, we had to state more clearly what the aims and expectations of the European public were. I think that this message was fully understood at the Zagreb Summit, which, for the first time, brought together the countries of the Western Balkans and the Fifteen. The prospect of membership of the European Union was offered and every country saw that this path was also the path of peace, of human rights and of regional cooperation. Admittedly, the Zagreb Summit did not solve all the problems, but it set a course to follow by means of the process of stabilisation and association; it consolidated the progress of democracy and defined a prospect which is in line with the values underpinning European action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Euro-Mediterranean Summit in Marseilles demonstrated, despite, unfortunately, the crisis is the Middle East, the importance attached by all the participants to maintaining and renewing the Barcelona process. We can welcome the fact that the Union was able to announce that it would be dedicating some EUR 13 billion to the process over a period of seven years, including, of course, the loans from the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I think that today I can say that in the last six months, our Union has gained strength from the process of preparing to welcome new members, to reunite the family now that we are all assured of being able to work together, to gain a firmer place in the hearts of our citizens in the fields of values, growth and employment, of solidarity, security and the preservation of the European social model and finally, to grow stronger and gain support on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Credit for this progress must be given to all of the institutions. I wish to pay tribute here to the quality of working relations between Member States within the Council. I wish to pay tribute to the Commission and its President, Romano Prodi, and to his determination to bring the initiatives and projects listed in the Presidency’s programme to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, however, in this Chamber, on my own behalf, on behalf of the French Prime Minister and Government, I wish first and foremost to thank this House for its contribution. It was crucial that the European Parliament, which is the mouthpiece for the European public and its ambitions, played a full role in taking the decisions that will affect the future of all of us. France has been particularly aware of this. You have often seen Mr Moscovici and the other ministers because the Council Presidency spoke 68 times on policy during your part-sessions and to the committees. The French Presidency thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for this cooperation, for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us.</p>

This was always likely, given its agenda and indeed that is precisely what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Positive decisions were taken at Nice, some of them long-awaited. The Charter of Fundamental Rights was solemnly proclaimed. I personally have no doubt that this is a seminal text and I would like to remind those who feel that it does not go far enough – and I know that many in this House are of this opinion – that it was drafted and conceived with care precisely with a view to giving it legal status.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission have already made it clear that, for their part, they intend to apply the Charter in full. Ladies and gentlemen, the original foundations of a European Company Statute were laid over 30 years ago. It is a legal instrument of obvious value which our operators had long been pressing for and which was sorely lacking during the major company restructuring we have experienced recently. I am happy to say that now there is no longer anything to prevent us from implementing it rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, the strategy proposed by the Commission was endorsed. The Social Agenda was also adopted, the fruit of productive cooperation with the Presidency, as has been pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals on maritime safety and the creation of a European Food Safety Authority met with strong support, as did the decisions on our seven outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the issues which were put before the Heads of State and Government. I would mention one other issue which I can sense will be of considerable importance: the Council also discussed the way in which the summits are organised. These events involve a huge amount of work, they are complex and they are held in a different place each time. The European Council took the wise decision to move gradually towards holding them all in Brussels. This will further reinforce the city's status as the capital of Europe</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">and, once the summits which have already been scheduled have taken place, one out of every two summits will be held in Brussels. Once the European Union has grown to 18 Member States, the decision will apply to all the summits. I sincerely believe that we should welcome this convincing initiative from Mr Chirac.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of Nice, I would first of all like to pay heartfelt tribute to Michel Barnier for his work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">He worked, as I did but to a greater extent, in collaboration with Parliament, particularly with Giorgio Napolitano and his Committee, with the two rapporteurs, Mr Leinen and Mr Dimitrakopoulos and, of course, with Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, whose commitment was total and absolute. Finally, Madam President, I would like to praise the truly exemplary clarity of your own speeches to the meetings of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will remember, Madam President, the last time that I addressed this House, just before the Summit, I said that we needed a treaty with genuine added value. In particular, I promised to return to this House with a frank assessment of the outcome. Moreover, in your own address at the beginning of the Summit, you said that Parliament would judge the success of Nice in terms of quality as well as quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a little while before we can make a full, accurate assessment of the progress made at Nice, but we can at this stage hazard a few observations. The first relates to the extension of qualified majority voting. This is a quantitatively important step forwards because it has brought 30 or so new chapters under this umbrella. As a result, qualified majority voting will increasingly become the general rule at the Council, and this must not be underestimated. Qualitatively, the same cannot be said. Little or no progress was made on the sensitive issues of cohesion, tax regulation and social legislation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in these areas, the Conference came up against the intransigence of some Member States. This is something which deeply disappoints me, not just because of the short-term consequences but because the attitude behind it shows a lack of openness and understanding. Anyone who sees Europe merely as a "clearing house"</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">to approach when necessary and to stay away from when they cannot get what they want or once they have got everything they want from it is not just making an error of historical analysis but is cheating future generations, who have the right to expect much more from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This inward-looking backdrop of reciprocal failure to make concessions does offer some small progress on justice and home affairs, however, although it has to be said that most of this progress has been deferred until after 2004. This is not to belittle it. It does, however, mean that the speed of development of the major new policy area of legal matters and cross-border crime, which was adopted in Tampere, is now under threat, and that the Tampere "scoreboard" will start to show delays. I hope that these delays will not be blamed on Parliament or the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Chirac and the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, for making it possible to put paid to the main ambiguities of our commercial policy. A good balance was struck between the legitimate concerns surrounding issues such as cultural diversity, in particular, and the effectiveness of our powers of negotiating with our trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Another source of satisfaction lies in the result in the field of closer cooperation. Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that what we have here is a tool that is vital for the enlarged Union, one that the Commission will make use of while taking care to play its "guarantor" role fully, firstly to make it possible for countries that wish to work together more closely towards major new common goals to do so, and secondly to counter any risk of fragmentation that unregulated use of such cooperation might bring.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the institutions themselves I would like to say three things. Where the Commission is concerned, there has been sweeping, far-reaching change. The Commission will be able to grow to 26 members. After that, the necessary and much hoped-for alterations will be made. These changes have been accompanied by the launching of major reform of the way in which the Commission is organised. The President will be appointed by majority rather than unanimous vote. After the vote of the Commission, the President will have the power to dismiss Commissioners and a wide degree of discretion regarding the actual organisation of the Commission itself, for example in matters such as the assigning of portfolios and the appointment of Vice-Presidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's main gain is a statute for political parties at European level. The Commission defended – unfortunately with no success although the matter has not yet been closed – our shared concerns regarding the protection of the Union's financial interests by proposing that a Prosecutor should be established. However, it is worrying that MEP numbers are being used essentially to counterbalance the equilibria in the Council. Much greater attention will need to be devoted in the future to this and other related problems, and we must move from a defensive role to a more strongly proactive one.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it was the weighting of votes in the Council that gave rise to the most difficult debate and the most difficult decision. This was inevitable given the approach taken, but the outcome was regrettable for two reasons: firstly because it made a qualified majority more difficult and a blocking minority accordingly easier, whereas logically, in an expanding Union, the exact opposite is required;</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">and secondly because it has made the decision-making process even more complex, which runs counter to the legibility and transparency for which the citizens are calling.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To respond to our citizens' demands, we had advocated a double majority as the only solution which is objective, comprehensible and widely supported by smaller and larger countries alike.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, we must pay particular tribute to the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, who fought to the very end for a more equitable presence for the candidate countries and to set the qualified majority threshold at a less unreasonable level – although one that is still too high. He thus confirmed Belgium's great historic role in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise that the hard-won conclusion of the Nice Summit was an achievement in itself. A conclusion had to be reached and, thanks to the efforts of the Presidency, we got there in the end. There are no leftovers from Nice. The next step is to work realistically towards ratifying the Treaty as soon as possible. This will enable us to move on to welcoming the new Members, in line with the Helsinki conclusions. We must proceed resolutely in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel – as President Chirac remarked – that the Nice Summit was characterised by the efforts of many to defend their own immediate interests, to the detriment of a long-term vision. Nice does, however, include a declaration on the future of the Union which gives me cause for some optimism. The Commission is aware of the importance of establishing a more precise division of competences between the European Union and the Member States. Incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, simplifying the layout of the Treaties and reviewing the role of our institutions. This review must be an open, thorough discussion on a vast scale, involving the governments, parliaments and citizens of the current Member States and the candidate countries and demonstrating the dynamism of a Europe which is still being built. There is a great need for such a discussion for the experience of Nice shows that the current method of reviewing the Treaties is no longer a valid one.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Like the Community structure itself, the process being used to produce institutional change is under stress and needs to be changed. The Commission will come up with proposals for improving this process, and I am counting upon your participation and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after these initial, incomplete remarks which I have tried to put to you objectively and with conviction, I would appeal to everyone to remember that the final objective of the Nice Summit was, and still is, the unification of Europe. The new Millennium has given us an unprecedented opportunity to bind together the countries of our continent in a wide area of peace, stability and economic growth. Nice is a step in this direction: a shorter step than we had hoped for, or indeed, could have made, but a step in the right direction all the same. I therefore ask you to lend us your support.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Chirac, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Chirac, our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has always received you here in the European Parliament with the greatest respect, open-mindedness and esteem. The same applies today because we value you as a person and because your office so demands. We appreciate the fact that you were here in July and have returned here today, but the esteem in which we hold both you as a person and your office does not absolve us from honesty and we have a duty to express our convictions loudly and clearly today in your presence.</p>
<p class="contents">You said at the end of the summit that the Nice Summit would go down in the history of Europe as a major summit. Unfortunately, our group cannot concur with that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We witnessed an Intergovernmental Conference which dragged on for months, followed by a summit in Nice at which we felt, even as we watched on television, that the Heads of State and Government – and this is a perfectly human trait – had reached the end of their physical and mental resources. Allow me to cite an example: thank God, the awful proposal that Poland should have fewer votes than Spain, despite having the same population, was revised. What sort of impression would Poland have had, with its experience of national socialism and communism, had it not been treated on a par with Spain. Thank God this has been corrected.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I mention this because proposals such as this arise in the maelstrom of a summit such as Nice but should never be repeated in the history of the European Union. We say today to the people of central Europe: you are welcome in our European Union and it was Alain Lamassoure's proposal, which then became our group's proposal, Parliament's proposal, the Commission's proposal – and thankfully you too have adopted it – that we ensure that the first central European countries are able to take part in the next European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we also witnessed the contrast between large and small countries over recent months – and this too should never be repeated, because it acts as an insidious poison in the European Union – with many large countries behaving most meanly and many small countries behaving most generously.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And we have seen with great concern over recent weeks and months, that governments are taking ever greater recourse to intergovernmentalism and governmental cooperation and I can only hope that the spirit of Pierre Pflimlin, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet will be the spirit and vision which determine the future of Europe ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... because we are firmly convinced that only a Europe of communities with strong European institutions can safeguard law, democracy, solidarity and peace for us on our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice obviously had its good and bad points; unfortunately there were a great many bad points. However, our yardstick for Nice from the beginning was the European Union's ability to act. Commission President Prodi, whom we thank, together with Michel Barnier – because we have not forgotten, Mr President, that Mr Barnier is a member of the Commission on your recommendation and we do not only want to criticise – has pointed out that it is precisely in the fundamental areas that qualified majority voting has not been extended in the Council of Ministers. For the European Parliament, which was the winner in Amsterdam, there has been no increase in codecision by the European Parliament and this is one of the great failings of the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to comment further on the complexities of the decision-making process because Elmar Brok from our group will certainly do so directly. But we have not achieved greater transparency. We have hope for the future and we do also see the good side, such as your commitment to the foreign, security and defence policy and the increase in Commission posts. We take you at your word, President Chirac, and I was delighted to hear that you want to involve the European Parliament closely in the post-Nice process. We expect all the Member States of the European Union and their governments to configure a conference in which the European Parliament is involved and helps to set the agenda and the procedure. We take you at your word that this will happen and then we shall perhaps move together towards a brighter future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard many fine words. You rightly speak of transparency. Above all, we need transparency in the Council of Ministers and we are most concerned to see that even the secretary-general – Mr Solana is more of high representative than a secretary-general – is prevented by the Community procedure from performing his duties as secretary-general as he would perhaps like to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We were delighted to hear that the European Parliament will be fully involved in the post-Nice process. On this depends our final answer, whether we say yes or no to Nice. We want a post-Nice process in which the European Parliament is involved both in setting the agenda and in the decision-making process. If you secure this then we shall have the chance to work together in a spirit of trust. We shall have to keep a very critical eye on the Council over coming weeks and months in order to ascertain if it too is in a position to safeguard the transparency of which you spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">These will be our yardsticks and, like you, we hope to be able to do our job so that we, the European Union, with our values, are truly open to the people of central Europe, who suffered a long time under Communism and who now wish to join our Community. We must open the door, but decisions must be made so that the European Union is also in a position to enlarge.</p>

For now we have got out of the tight spot. Now we need to look at the text carefully in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, I can tell you what is on the Council web site, or at least what was on it at 10.00 this morning: the Treaty will be available when it has been approved. Please ask the Council staff to at least update the text. I think that ‘something’ was approved in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the fact that an agreement has been reached is an achievement in itself. Because it was not about residue, leftovers or ends to tie up from what was discussed in Amsterdam and not agreed on. It was about fundamental issues for the governance of Europe, and we can now start working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are taking your word on the content of the agreement but, from what we are gradually discovering, there is not much cause for satisfaction. It should be pointed out that, in principle, the aim of the Intergovernmental Conference was to improve the functioning of the Union in order to achieve enlargement. I am afraid that we have before us a compromise between national interests that has been hammered out all in one go, at night, which will make it even more difficult to make Community decisions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is the unanimity rule being maintained in a few crucial areas, but we also now have three types of qualified majority. The level of 62% of the population has been replaced, according to some, by 71% and, according to others, by 73.49% in order to achieve a qualified majority. The percentage is so high that it amounts to re-establishing a veto, especially for the largest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a step backwards that applies to all areas of Community life, and I predict, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that our fellow citizens – and I am afraid also the Members of Parliament and the Heads of Government – are going to have to go back to school for lessons in arithmetic.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will have to look very carefully at the role that has been allocated to the Commission and Parliament in the Union’s decision-making process. If we want the Union to reflect the interests of all of its Member States and all of its peoples as a community of values, according to the Community method, the institutions that can guarantee this are the Commission and Parliament, acting within the framework of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. If those institutions are weakened and the Charter remains outside of the Treaty, how are we going to bring Europe closer to its citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the declaration on enlargement – which is a positive one – says that the applicant countries will be able to join the Union at the end of 2002, and the Heads of Government of the countries that are in negotiations have welcomed Nice. Now we have to take something into account: this is like when a child invites his friends to a birthday party and it is not sure whether there is enough room in the house or whether there is enough money for the food. We have to be responsible in our commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">How have we come to this situation? It is too easy to blame the President-in-Office of the Council, especially as the majority of the political families represented here are also represented in the Council. And we have come to this situation because the method of the Intergovernmental Conference no longer works.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the Union make constitutional decisions by staying up for three nights? What was the point of eleven months of Intergovernmental Conference, two conclaves and countless meetings of the General Affairs Council?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, by the way, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that this is paid for by taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">How can decisions that reflect the dual legitimacy of the Union be made by only one side? I would like to make an appeal to you: no more Intergovernmental Conferences behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the declaration on the future of the Union – which I welcome on behalf of my Group – for the first time there is a mention of the need to renew its working methods: the need for a wider debate in which all the parties involved can take part. There is already such a method. It is the convention method: nine months, a happy delivery...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">...while in Nice, we still do not know what the child is like. And I really think that we should use the convention method to determine the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is certain that, as far as the subjects of Nice that you yourself, Mr Chirac, pointed out – the European Company Statute, the Social Agenda, mad cow disease, maritime safety – there are sufficient causes to say that the Summit was a success.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the institutional matters are concerned, however, we will have to study them and make a judgment. Today, we cannot take a decision. We want to make a positive contribution, but now – and I will now conclude, Madam President – in order to live up to our ambitions, what we have to do is ask the Swedish Presidency to initiate the process of debate, in which we need precision timing, because it is what this Union needs, positively affirming our defence policy and developing the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the challenge that we now face.</p>

That is my point of departure, because without a Treaty at Nice we would be in a significant political and institutional crisis; without a Treaty at Nice we would send a clear signal to candidate states that there were indeed serious obstacles in our path. Therefore the outcome is to be welcomed. With regard to the content of the Treaty of Nice, as others have said here today, we must reflect, we must see the texts, we must form a considered judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say that there are parts we like and much about which we are concerned. The ambition which was taken to Nice was the greatest European ambition for a summit meeting now for many years. It was the ambition to prepare the way for a continental-scale enlargement in Europe and that is the test by which we must judge the content at Nice. Is it capable of delivering an effective operational continental-scale enlargement? That was the ambition, and many in this House fear that it may have fallen short of what was required.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has nonetheless reached one definitive conclusion which others have also referred to today. That is that the current intergovernmental model of deciding these things reached and passed its sell-by date with Nice. After nine months, more than 330 hours of preparation in formal sessions, thousands of hours of preparation surrounding those sessions, it ended up in the spectacle of the extraordinary difficulty of the negotiators being stuck at the end still having to try to resolve everything because in all that had gone before, nothing of substance had been decided. That is not the way to do business for Europe, nor, in fairness to the French presidency, is it the way to ask any presidency to have to conclude such a complex process. We believe the time for change has come.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment, albeit at second-hand having followed in the media the detail of what happened at Nice, about the general atmosphere surrounding the discussions. When we look at the progress which has been made on the reweighting of votes, clearly it is complex and difficult to explain, but the emphasis that was coming out of Nice in reports to the media from the various national delegations was how things could be blocked rather than how things could be promoted. The atmosphere had more to do with the negative aspects of a great European project and vision than a positive promotion of what is deep and good about the European dream, and that is a disappointing feature of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I want to salute the work of the European Commission. I want to salute the European fortitude of Romano Prodi. I want to salute the detailed work of Commissioner Barnier. I want to salute the European spirit of Mr Verhofstadt, the Belgian Prime Minister which held up to the very end at four or half past four in the morning. But those who stood up most for Europe, I think found it rather a thankless task and that is greatly to be regretted. I want to say for my group that when it comes to dealing with the European Commission, when it comes to the model that has made Europe achieve what we want to see, when we look at the dual legitimacy of the European process based on a Monnet method with a strong intergovernmental input, we do not see the European Commission and their advisers as <span class="italic">petits fonctionnaires</span>. They are central to our European politicians' mission and they are essential to that task.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are tensions now. There is a creeping tendency towards intergovernmentalism. But the Schuman-Monnet method has helped us not only to create but to deliver the European dream. I would say to those who trample on that: do so with great caution because you trample on our dreams when you break up a method which has worked so well. I know some sceptics do not like it but they never will. The substantial majority in this House, however, believe in it and the substantial majority in this House appreciate why it has worked.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to contemplate the next phase 2004. I am pleased to hear President Chirac remark it will not be an obstacle to enlargement. I believe it will be an opportunity and we must grasp the opportunity also to raise the questions of reforming the Council, of reforming the method that we bring to these important tasks and to make sure that the Charter on Fundamental Rights becomes meaningful as law and not simply as a proclamation. This will give us a real opportunity to address the perceived shortcomings of Nice. I have listened carefully to what Romano Prodi has said. He said we must be ambitious but temper our ambition with reality. It is an important message and it is understood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to give you a little history lesson, concerning a famous French doctor, whose name was Coué and who invented a method – the Coué method – based on the principle of autosuggestion and self-hypnosis.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This doctor suggested that every one of us should say the following to ourselves, when we get up in the morning: today I feel better than I did yesterday but not as well as I will feel tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think that in politics, this is a valuable principle, but it should not be used too liberally. I welcome the fact that the various Members present today have not done so. I therefore welcome their speeches. I do not often feel this way but I am actually very happy with what has been said so far. My personal view of the Nice Summit is that it was a failure. I consider it to be a failure not only in terms of the European Union’s stated ambition to change the institutions so that they are capable of properly receiving the new Member States by improving the European Union’s efficiency, but I also consider it to be a failure in terms of another important aim, which has perhaps not been sufficiently highlighted, which is the rapprochement of the European Union and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to my first point, I think that everything necessary has been said on the matter. I would nevertheless like to mention a number of factors that concern the European Parliament, the European Parliament to which President Chirac very kindly paid tribute, but which has largely been forgotten in the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For the first time – and I would remind you that I took part in Maastricht and in Amsterdam – Parliament has been given less weight in the European decision-making process. This is a very serious matter. Granted, the number of Members of the European Parliament has increased in relation to what had been envisaged, which goes a little way to allaying some of our fears, but the result will be more Members with fewer powers. I am not sure that this is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my concerns for democracy and transparency. I should like to give an example with regard to transparency: Article 133 on commercial policy. I have not seen the definitive texts – no one here has – but I have seen three pages, annexes 5 and 6, on commercial policy. I read them three times and I promise you that I did not fully understand them. Perhaps I am not clever enough, but the truth is that I could not fully understand them. Nevertheless, I did understand one thing: the European Commission would gain power; the Council would increase its control and Parliament would be left out. In an area as sensitive, as politically sensitive, as this, for which there is popular support, I consider this to be a serious political mistake. I felt the need to say this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are many things I could say about codecision. Where is this codecision? Almost no progress has been made on this. This is also extremely serious. I therefore believe that, on this point, as Members of the European Parliament and as representatives of the public, we have a genuine obligation to show our annoyance and, politically, to translate our annoyance into positive action. This is what I shall be taking a few words to do. I think that what was lacking at Nice was a European vision.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This was completely absent from the Nice Summit. It is national governments that are responsible for this and I am not blaming any particular government here – and I am not blaming the French Presidency more than any other presidency, as this is not the time or the place to do so. Mr Barón Crespo was quite right when he said that we must challenge the whole intergovernmental method. Governments are responsible for their image in international national public opinion and must look after this image. This is quite reasonable, but nevertheless, they do not bother about their image where international public opinion is concerned. A few do, but many do not make any effort. We should be aware that this leads to considerable nervousness in European thinking. We must therefore find a new method. We have seen the limits, which have become clearer and clearer. We now have the beginnings of a process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am somewhat less enthusiastic than others about the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This has been described as a baby that is delivered at full term, but which is nevertheless a puny little thing. I had hoped for a healthy baby, and that is why we would need a method which is probably based on that of the Convention, but which has a much more ambitious mandate for the reform of the European institutions and above all, which functions more democratically. We cannot escape from having a widespread debate on the European Union’s objectives, on the European Union’s ambition on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is what I hope for. I take genuine pleasure in the consensus that I feel exists in this House. This is the first time that our analyses of the situation converge so strongly and I think that this is a positive indication for the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Republic, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my group takes a very dim view of the Fifteen following the rather unappetising spectacle they put on for the European people, who were probably amazed to see on that occasion, and at first hand, the real common vision, sense of solidarity and mutual trust that exists between the major European leaders. Although, despite everything, I welcomed the conclusion of an agreement with a certain amount of relief, I did so because, as Mr Cox said, a failure at Nice would have been used by the shameless opponents of enlargement if not to sound the death knell, at least to call for the indefinite postponement of this great project. We would then have sent the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe a signal of incalculable political consequences. There is nothing less secure today than a successful enlargement but at least the way remains open for action in favour of such a prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, what a cruel illustration of the crisis which is not only institutional, but which, at a deeper level, is an identity crisis for European integration in the face of the titanic issues confronting the European Union! The problem facing the Fifteen lies, I believe, less in their difficulty in providing sound responses, than in their refusal to address the right questions. We feel that the right questions are those on the lips of the impressive human tide which converged on Nice from all over Europe on the eve of the Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">This was not a handful of troublemakers from the margins of society but workers who were uniting with the most representative waves of public opinion in their respective countries. Some of them were supporters of the beginnings of European integration and probably voters – men and women – from most of the political families represented here. Beyond their differences, all their questions in one way or another concerned a fundamental issue: the purpose of this integration whose institutions we wish to reform.</p>
<p class="contents">For whom is it designed? What is its point? Where is this Europe of the Fifteen headed today, and even more to the point, the great Europe with twenty-seven or thirty, tomorrow? Is it condemned to collapse under the current system of liberal globalisation? Is its purpose to speed up the process of deregulation? To make competition the be all and end all of their economic policy? To try to destroy everything that is the essence of our societies through the rationale of commerce, to the point that people need to rally together to achieve a few exceptions and to concentrate all the power at the top, far from everyday life and far from the people?</p>
<p class="contents">Is there any more relevant question than that of whether other choices are conceivable? Choices in which most members of the public can recognise themselves? Major joint projects in Europe itself and on the international stage, in which they would find reasons and pleasure in committing themselves together, projects designed to achieve a shared dominance of the markets, a common, proactive political approach in the economic, social and cultural fields, real access for social actors to the necessary information and to the decision-making and control procedures, from their company to the institutions. What preliminary answers to these legitimate questions did the Nice European Council give the public? The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was supposed to be a figurehead for this summit was dispatched without ceremony.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is the European defence force, along with the military language that has accompanied its miraculously rapid creation, able to give the European adventure the boost that it needs. Symptomatically, it is in the few areas in which the demand for concrete measures had been clearly demonstrated in our societies that a few positive agreements have finally been reached between the Fifteen. I am thinking of food safety, maritime safety, the declaration on the specific nature of sport with regard to competition rules or even the European Company Statute. With regard to the Social Agenda, although we would be hard pushed to find the specific objectives that we hoped for, at least it offers elements that will provide support for action in the next five years. That may be true, but this does not make a project and unless there is a common project, institutional reform could only lead to a form of soulless and unceremonious inter-State horse-trading.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I share my group’s view that the Nice European Council will ultimately have been the turning point for a kind of institutional and political construction that has shown its limitations and has reached the end of its useful life. The absence of a coherent, comprehensible, and inspiring common project, the refusal to hold a public and transparent debate on the various options due to an apparent consensus, which is inevitably liberal and hostile to any sign of independence from the established order, the exacerbation of violent relations between partners from the same Community and the excessive concentration of power in the leadership of States over the heads of their citizens – these are all issues that are not recent but which are now undeniable in the open debate on Europe’s future. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pasqua (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate you on the marvellous stamina that you demonstrated at the Nice marathon. My congratulations must end there, however, as I am sorry that you did not apply this stamina to the subjects that were entrusted to you.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that the Nice Summit was a success because it finally led to an agreement. I would say to you, “big deal!” because everyone knew from the outset that the French Presidency was set on doing everything to ensure that an agreement was reached in Nice, largely for reasons of domestic politics. I wish to say, at the risk of destroying your illusions, that no one here has been fooled. The obstacles between the Fifteen that multiplied during the Summit are symptomatic. Any clear-thinking person can see that they herald the very serious consequences to which the project of a Federal Europe of 27 or 28 Member States is leading us. The most astonishing thing is that you are cobbling together this pipe dream at a time when the opinion polls suggest that the majority of Europe’s citizens are against this.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking mainly on behalf of the French members of my group, I will say that there is a permanent contradiction between the virtues attributed to this Europe and the aberrations seen in the daily workings of the Union. Europe’s leaders, of which you are one, are reduced to carrying out increasingly frequent operations to manipulate the media and public opinion. The technique is now tried and tested: always put off for another time the burden of proof; take decisions that are void of content or which will not be implemented for a long time and finally present the whole business as a magnificent success. The Nice summit is to some extent the apotheosis of this sleight-of-hand strategy. First of all, the Fifteen signed the agreement on the sly and under the smokescreen created by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This document is a monument of ambiguity and was presented by some people as a crucial text, which would be a prelude to a future European constitution, and by others, as a simple declaration of intent with no legal force.</p>
<p class="contents">This text has been exalted as the democratic progress of a citizens’ Europe but no one has bothered, of course, to find out what the European public actually wants. You yourself, Mr President and your Prime Minister have presented this text as the triumph of French secularism and by Chancellor Schröder as the victory of German religious sentiment. All it took to achieve this was quite simply to have the French and German versions of the Charter not say the same thing. We should have thought about that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Nice Summit then adopted a European Social Agenda, but this document has no binding power. It simply sets a handful of objectives for the next five years, which the Member States are free to decide whether to pursue or not, depending on the policies they choose. Then the summit announced that an agreement had been concluded on maritime safety. Hallelujah! Is this a decisive agreement? Not at all. It is simply a decision inviting the Member States’ Transport Ministers to agree on the measures needing to be taken. Let us add to this list of triumphs the announcement of the creation of a food agency that will not come into operation until 2001. To crown it all, the European leaders who met at Nice decided to open a new institutional project in 2004. This will – apologies for it being so minimal – clarify the European Treaties, the precise status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and lay down the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly something rotten about the whole business. From evasions to pretences and from hypocritical agreements to sermons on the future, this Federal Europe is beginning to look like a house of cards whose roofs are growing higher and higher but whose foundations are quaking, because the real lesson of the Nice Summit is the enormity of the historical misunderstanding in which our continent has been mired since the Treaty of Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States do not have the support of the people because there is no such thing as a European people and they are therefore forced by public opinion to advocate their national interests with increasing fervour, even if this means changing the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is already out of date, and even if this means increasing the number of European Commissioners to 27, even though the current Commission of Fifteen does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that, after Nice, France appears once again to have been the clear loser. Because you are paralysed with the fear of having fewer seats than Germany in the Council of Ministers, you have definitively capitulated on everything else: on the number of French Members in this Chamber, which is reduced from 87 to 74 – oh, I agree, this would not be a big loss – whereas Germany will keep its 99 Members without losing a single one: at least for the sake of those who believe that this House serves some purpose, the number ought to have been maintained; on the so-called “demographic slice” principle, which gives a considerable advantage to Germany; on one of the two Commissioners in Brussels and on our right of veto in the very many areas concerning our vital interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The final result is preposterous. No one understands the operating rules of this labyrinthine system any more. It upsets almost everyone, beginning with those known as the smaller countries. The only clear outcome is that the European nation-states are on their way – unwillingly – to becoming nothing more than provinces within an authoritarian federal state, whose strategic and military objectives appear to be those of the United States. This will happen unless we oppose it. We must bring an immediate end to this insane abdication of the sovereignty of the European Nations. This is why, as far as we are concerned, we will ask the President of France to consult the French people at the appropriate time by means of a referendum on this Treaty.</p>

Having wallowed in cohabitation, these professional politicians have lain down in resignation over a treaty that they just had to sign in Nice as if Germany’s fate depended on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal and Belgium have, on this occasion, had a greater influence than France, which conceded on everything and obtained nothing apart from preserving a vague cultural exception, which is a pretext for a new concept, which Mr Védrine has invented, for the sake of the cause, of a sovereignty that would be both national and exercised jointly. Even Edgar Faure must be turning in his grave!</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when these so-called leaders are incapable of transposing fifty or so directives except by edict, in other words, by decree-law, they are accepting, with straight faces, to reduce French representation in the European Parliament by around 20%, despite having given these representatives the task of protecting French interests under codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as France is concerned, each of these Treaties is, unfortunately, worse than the one before, but they confirm the rationale of Maastricht, a fine example of Mitterrandesque finagling that is likely to end badly. And what about poor Mr Chirac, who believes what Gerhard says, in the same way that Jaurès believed in world peace!</p>
<p class="contents">Into what situation will all these people have dragged France when the European bubble bursts and the French have nothing in their mouths but the bitter taste of having been conned once again by their mediocre and self-serving leaders? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At Nice, it simply boosted the power of the technocrats.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis within the Commission has not led to any reform of its role or of the way in which it functions. All that has been proposed to us is an increase of its President’s powers and I doubt that even this would have prevented the dysfunction demonstrated by the Santer Commission. The negotiations of the last few days have proved that it was nothing but a laughable process of haggling. People are fighting over power of influence and postponing the distribution of competences and the clarification of the European Union’s objectives until 2004, even though making everything uniform is still clearly the order of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told of parity between the larger States but the division is confirmed with 27 additional seats being allocated to just one country. Enough hypocrisy! The right of each Member State to be heard within the Council should have been recognised in Nice. For this to happen, one vote is enough and would enable us to avoid the countless calculations of weighting imposed by qualified majority voting. Taking into account these interests and differences within the Council would have avoided the debates on the number of Commissioners to which each State is clinging.</p>
<p class="contents">When I hear a Commissioner calling for an end to the cultural exception and for the extension of qualified majority voting to Article 133 in international negotiations, I must state that, personally, the loss of one Commissioner would not be particularly serious.</p>
<p class="contents">This House ought to represent the expression of an elected majority that backs the decisions of ministers who, I would remind you, are answerable to their respective national parliamentary representations. You chose to follow another path. We find this truly deplorable and it will benefit neither Europe itself nor any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Summit’s conclusions, I am stunned to see the discrepancy between the proclamations on the services of general interest and the dismantling of the postal service, which is on the agenda for this part-session. My fear is that the objective of full employment, which is part of the Social Agenda, may suffer the same fate.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Europe’s image is concerned, this Presidency has been a failure. The common interest appears to diminish the signing of a treaty that is designed to provide solutions by transferring ever more sovereignty against the wishes expressed by the public. Furthermore, we could adopt the formula suggested by the Economic and Social Council and say that Europe is experiencing a serious lack of public debate. Sometimes out of convenience or as a matter of urgency, the issue is dodged or cut short and sometimes a debate does take place but the experts and the elites are often the only players that are heard, that are listened to and who really influence decision-making. The danger of this is that the public will feel alienated from the decisions that actually concern them directly.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is disappointed by this Treaty and is worried about the future that it holds for us and we will therefore use all our power to oppose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I take it as a welcome sign of the fact that tensions have eased since then. While waiting for the outcome from Nice, I was put in mind of my old mathematics professor. Two out of four problems unsolved elicited a pitiless "unsatisfactory" from him. Until late into Sunday, it looked like Nice too might earn such a mark. Then a compromise was found. In essence, the total compromise is less than the sum of its parts. Nonetheless, from an Austrian point of view, it is a result we can live with.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally welcome, above all, the juridification of all stages of the sanctions procedure, especially the facility for the Court of Auditors to exercise control. As an Austrian I know what I am talking about. The rule of law has triumphed here over political arbitrariness. Many have complained about the lack of progress on qualified majority voting. I take a more relaxed view. The heads of state and government may have exercised restraint in certain areas, but at least they did not use their right of veto after long hours of negotiation just for the heck of it. On the contrary, their restraint was driven by serious problems and concerns and the result of informed national opinion, which cannot be swept to one side and must be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we make our citizens identify more closely with Europe if we do not heed their concerns? For many citizens, things are simply moving too fast. Many still have no sight of the port into which the European Union is supposed to sail one day. As far as I am concerned, deliberate, considered action makes far more sense than rushing into the fray. However, what is worrying in this situation, and this is something which both I and Mr Poettering have warned against, is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation may be used as a circumvention strategy in areas in which no decision can be reached by a qualified majority. This sort of approach would not only contradict the <span class="italic">ultima ratio </span>clause; it would, in my view, also represent a serious threat to the development of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Chirac,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have, of course, listened with great interest to the comments made by all the groups through their chairmen’s speeches. I shall simply make a few comments and then leave Mr Moscovici the task of answering all the questions dealing with specific matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard what Mr Poettering had to say, I wish to make a general observation. I understand and share the ambition of a Chamber such as yours, which is by vocation, by definition, to assert a vision of the Europe of tomorrow or even of the more distant future, and to ensure that ongoing impetus is given to these changes and to the implementation of this vision. I understand this perfectly as it is your role and I would even say, your function.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is also, of course, the reality of the situation, the daily reality, the opportunity for the public represented by their governments to accept the pace of these changes and even their objectives. In the framework of European integration, I have been struck several times by the claim by a Head of State or Government that, “of course, we could take that path, but the fact is that the public in my country would not accept it”.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the political position of my own government is at stake in this matter. Beyond that, however, and more seriously, the accession process, whether adopted by means of a referendum or by parliament, risks sanctioning changes that have not been approved and which would consequently bring European integration to an end. That is the danger. I shall not mention any names of course, but certain Heads of State or Government say, with regard to sensitive issues, and rightly so because they are in the best position to understand them as the democratically appointed representatives of their people, what is acceptable or not to public opinion in their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to integrate Europe as quickly as possible, but if we come up against a refusal that threatens the whole structure and which leads to everything grinding to a halt, then this is not what we want to see at all. We must move ahead as quickly as possible, but we must take care to avoid obstacles that would drag the process out indefinitely. There is therefore a trick to carrying off this process, in which everyone must play their role. It is up to the governments, which are – I repeat – representatives democratically appointed by their citizens, to lead them and to see the limits that they can or cannot exceed and the pace that they can accept as a whole. It is up to others, mainly Parliament and the Commission, to provide the necessary impetus and to convince the public. In other words, we must make our minds up but we must also convince, as decisions that do not convince are not particularly useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I have simply tried to highlight all of the negative comments made about the outcome of the Nice Summit, because I know very well what would have happened if no agreement had been reached, which was a possibility right up to the last minute. Enlargement would have been halted, which would have been the worst situation in which we could have found ourselves. Our objective was first and foremost to put ourselves in a position in which we could enable enlargement to take place. Well, we achieved that objective. It is true that this does not fulfil all the ambitions that we might have, which are legitimate, noble, and justified and which I share, but the time also comes when realism must be applied, in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a general observation, to which I shall add two more specific observations following on from what Mr Poettering said about the shortcomings of majority voting and the development of qualified majority voting. The Presidency regrets these shortcomings and itself had reservations and made a considerable effort to ensure that France made progress in areas about which it is particularly sensitive. I am sorry that not everyone was able to adopt the same attitude. Here too, however, there is the problem of the citizens concerned and of the responsibilities that their representatives may or may not assume. Let us not forget that, with regard to referendums, some countries have voted against whilst others voted in favour – I am referring here to Maastricht – and rightly so. There are, therefore, also constraints that must be appreciated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I do not want people thinking they can put it about – I do not know where you get your information, Mr Poettering – that one draft gave Poland fewer votes than Spain. There was a technical error which meant that, momentarily…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">No, no, please, I was in charge of it. Irony on a matter like this is misplaced.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a technical error on one paper, momentarily. Actually it was a typing error, and the paper was immediately withdrawn and of course the right figures were put in. Nobody could have imagined that anyone – certainly not the French Presidency, everyone knows what close ties France has always had with Poland – was suggesting handicapping Poland by comparison with Spain, when their populations are just about the same. I needed to say that to stop false information getting about.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the Charter. The French Presidency is absolutely open about incorporating the Charter into the Treaty. Some countries are not in favour of that, as you know. It was never envisaged that this would be an item on the Nice agenda. From the start the issue was always to be held over to the next presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Like a number of other speakers, Mr Barón Crespo also mentioned the defects in the method. First, I entirely endorse your support for the convention method, and I will tell you the whole truth: when I heard that the convention method had been chosen for drawing up the Charter, I was sceptical. I have to say that the facts have proved me wrong, because it has been a great success, and that means the method was a good one. I think so and I have taken the opportunity to emphasise that, at Nice especially. It should also be said that the way the convention is being chaired by President Herzog is absolutely exemplary, which also makes things easier, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt we do need to reform the method. And I know the Commission – President Prodi mentioned this just now – should be making some proposals on this. Certainly something needs to be done about it. It is not normal to work day and night, keep staff working when they have hardly had a wink of sleep for three days, and still hope to draft decisions or take decisions in a calm atmosphere. I think that is right. Obviously, there is all the advance preparation. It was not wasted because it meant a whole series of issues that had been dealt with earlier did not have to be raised at Nice. I am thinking of the tax package, the Social Agenda, and lots of other things. But in the end, on the essential points – and this is in the nature of things – the Heads of State and Government reserve the right to wait till the last minute to take decisions or accept compromises, and they will never allow staff to deal with those issues at an earlier stage. So there is a problem with the method and, as several speakers have said, it ought to be reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cox paid warm homage to the Commission and I naturally endorse that homage. He also mentioned something President Prodi said, which I particularly endorse and which brings me back to my first remark: we must be ambitious, President Prodi said, but we must temper our ambition with realism. That is wise, and we must always remember it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye talked about a setback for enlargement. What would have happened if there had been no agreement on enlargement? I think it is a bit extreme to talk about a setback there. Anyway, all the countries concerned were unanimous in approving what was done in Nice. He also mentioned reversal for the European Parliament. I listed the areas where progress has been made earlier. I am not going to go over that again. Perhaps we did not make as much progress as you were hoping for, but you know, there again, some countries had reservations. Still, there has been no reversal and the European Parliament can never have been – I think this can be said, I am speaking under the eye of the President and those responsible – can never have been as much involved and consulted as it has been during the French Presidency. I would just like to make that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz mentioned the human tide in Nice. Not counting certain irresponsible troublemakers who, of course, turned up with intentions which had nothing to do with the progress of human thought, there was indeed excellent and extensive participation, for which the European Confederation of Trade Unions was largely responsible. That was not a problem; I think it was a form of participation in the general debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we should try to ensure better conditions for a more general debate, which is more inclusive of civil society, if only to give our thoughts some oxygen. That is often difficult to do, precisely because people do not necessarily always have the same ulterior motives. But when it comes to globalisation, which calls for very broad public debate, we need to find ways to allow everyone to express their views somehow, in a calm atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation is inevitable; it means considerable progress in terms of standards of living, social advances and economic development, which determines everything else. But if we are not careful, globalisation will also entail grave dangers like exclusion: exclusion of some countries, indeed a growing number of countries, and exclusion within the countries of a growing number of men and women. It will also entail considerable risk to the balance of our ecosystem, our ability to bequeath a suitable environment to our successors; it will entail dangers for development, notably because of modern communications techniques and cyber crime. These are serious dangers and it is our duty to control and humanise globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that some leaders are getting a bit carried away here by the cult of theory and, one way or another, all shades of public opinion need to be expressed. On this point I recognise the value of the arguments set out by Mr Wurtz.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to my friend Charles Pasqua who was kind enough to compliment me on my physical prowess. That does not surprise me and I thank him for it. What does surprise me is the philosophical direction of his criticism, because what is he really telling us? He is telling us that within these walls and at Nice we have taken empty decisions or decisions which will not be implemented for a long time. And he adds that we have decided on a handful of targets which the Member States are free to apply if they want to. So that should not worry you…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and that does not justify your claim that those empty and distant decisions, or those targets, whether applied or not, amount to an insane abdication of the sovereignty of the nations of Europe. There seems to be a contradiction there…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… that I cannot entirely resolve. But, after all, I do know and appreciate the subtlety of Charles Pasqua’s thought, I have known him a long time and consider him a friend. So I will have a good think and try to understand his argument.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Coming to Mr De Gaulle’s speech, I have to say that I am simply not capable of penetrating the subtleties and nuances of his remarks. So I leave the full responsibility for his assertions to him.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Saint-Josse said there is a lack of public debate. I have already responded on that score and I fully endorse what he said about the need to improve public debate considerably. I will not repeat what I said, but it is true that citizens too often feel alienated from decisions taken in forums they do not know. That is one of the challenges we must take up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say to Mr Hager that in my view the instrument of enhanced cooperation is a useful instrument giving Europe a dynamic, and lighting the way ahead as Mr Romano Prodi said just now, I think. Personally, I am very much in favour of it.</p>
