<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we are seeing an increasing frequency in natural disasters here in Europe and around the world. As we have seen recently, floods and forest fires wreak havoc, causing human and economic problems and also serious damage to our environment. Of course we are trying to combat these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to forest fires, a series of common measures in the field of prevention, protection and restoration have now been put in place. Our rural development programmes provide support for a wide range of forest activities, providing funds for prevention of fires and restoration of forests damaged by fires, according to priorities decided by the Member States. In Portugal approximately EUR 149 m from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund is available for prevention and restoration for 2000-2006. In Spain the total budget allocated for forestry measures for the same period amounts to EUR 820 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently created EU Solidarity Fund was established to respond to major disasters which caused direct damage of more than EUR 3 bn or exceeded 0.6% of the affected country's gross national income. Only in very exceptional circumstances can the Solidarity Fund be mobilised for disasters that remain below this high threshold. It has already been mobilised following the huge fires last year in Portugal and Spain and, at their request, it provided EUR 48.5 m for Portugal and EUR 1.3 m for Spain. The Commission has not yet received any requests for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Forest Focus regulation is our most recent instrument to monitor and to implement prevention measures in the field of forest fires, as well as to detect the reasons for their frequency. The financial framework for the implementation of the Forest Focus scheme for 2003-2006 is fixed at EUR 65 m, of which EUR 9 m can be used for fire prevention measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our civil protection assistance mechanism is also proving its worth. In 2003 and 2004 Portugal sent requests for assistance to the EU Monitoring and Information Centre, which then coordinated support offers from other participating countries. Thanks to the mechanism, it was possible to ensure the rapid despatch of aerial forest fire-fighting means to Portugal. In 2003 Portugal accepted the assistance of two aircraft from Italy and three aircraft from Germany. In 2004 Spain supplied three aircraft, France two, Germany two, Greece two and Italy one. Additional assistance was offered by the UK and Norway but was not taken up by Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Four years ago I expressed my concerns about the increasing number of forest fires and the damage they cause, stating that the risk for forest fires and the vulnerability of our forests have now reached a level beyond which further fires would seriously endanger the ecosystems and their sustainable management. Sadly we saw this happen during last year's heatwave, which hit southern Europe in particular and which culminated in the destruction of large parts of the Portuguese Natura areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by saying that the Commission has taken your resolution of 4 September 2003 on the effects of the summer heatwave into account, and it serves as a very useful compendium for actions and measures on which to base future initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are 45 000 fires per year in the European Union and they are going to become increasingly frequent, because drought, a structural problem in the European Union, is going to cause increasingly serious environmental problems, and not just in the south of Europe, but in the north as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the United Nations’ experts tell us that, as a result of climate change, this problem is going to continue to worsen, and we are faced with a situation in which we have no genuine common policy for combating fires aimed at tackling these 45 000 fires per year in the European Union. We lack measures, resources and money.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you of Regulation 2158/92, the expiry of which led the European Commission to show that it wanted to put an end to the lines of aid for fighting fires.</p>
<p class="contents">When this Parliament debated Forest Focus, it managed to obtain the ridiculous figure of EUR 9 million until 2006 from the European Commission. On the other hand, we have the forestry chapter of the Rural Development Regulation. That Regulation has not worked. I agree with the Commissioner when she talks about EUR 820 million, but this sum is under-utilised. It is badly used because there is no coordination at either inter-regional or inter-State level. The Member States act as they wish and improvise. It is true that the French have sent two aircraft to help fight the fire in Portugal, but in no way was it done in a coordinated fashion. And neither is there any inter-regional coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of this is what has happened this year in Spain. There is a region in the north of Spain – Galicia – which contains the greatest area of forest. Ninety-nine per cent of the fires that break out in that autonomous region are brought under control within 24 hours. Forest fires are fought effectively in Galicia, and progress is being made through forest activation plans which are increasing all the time. Its rate of fires is five times less than the average for the Spanish State. Nevertheless, in Andalusia we have seen 42 131 hectares burn because the resources available have not been used. This is a dramatic situation and this should be a good opportunity to put it right. How? By applying a bit of common sense to all this, because, since the European Commission has to present the European forest strategy over the coming months, this must be the opportunity to consider this problem in depth and to implement a forestry policy in the European Union that takes measures for protecting forests from fire seriously and, above all, that helps to coordinate administrations so that, as a minimum and if resources are not increased, the scant instruments available at the moment are used properly and so that the experiences of the Junta de Andalusia and the European Union as a whole this summer never happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figure relating to the area burnt suggests a genuine ecological disaster. In my region alone – as has already been pointed out – in Andalusia, so far this year more than 40 000 hectares of forest have burnt down in a total of 753 fires.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the consequences of this summer’s fires, we should ask ourselves frankly whether the Commission’s opposition to increasing the budgetary contributions stemming from the Forest Focus Regulation was justified. The Commission should also ask itself seriously whether it was right to shift the burden of fire prevention to regional and rural development funds without establishing suitable control mechanisms to ensure that they are actually used for prevention, reforestation and the regeneration of these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality at the moment is that there is an urgent need for help in our countries. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to clarify whether it is studying the possibility of allocating any additional funds in order to restore the funds in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should not take a single step backwards in terms of its policy on climate change. The question is very clear: does the Commission believe that the European Union is acting appropriately to protect its forest heritage? Does the Commission believe it would be possible to allocate extraordinary funds from the Solidarity Fund or employ some other much quicker mechanism to alleviate the effects of these fires, which are destroying a natural heritage that the whole of Europe benefits from? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We Greens call for a pre-emptive war against fires. The current abandonment of rural areas, depopulation, demographic movement away from the countryside, is having horrendous results. The European funds do not reach the people responsible for managing the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who have lived from forest resources such as cork, or holm oak acorns, for example, in Andalusia, have lost their source of income. This is no accident, but the obvious result of a policy that puts the rural areas last, which does not provide the resources and which is aimed at planting species such as eucalyptus and pine – something which some Members of this House are now criticising but previously advocated – leaving behind a legacy of ignorance which then leads to fires. This situation requires investment in civil and rural society, both in programmes like Leader, the abandonment of which is now being considered, and in other rural programmes, which reflect some of the social fabric of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, little has been learnt and this year forest fires have tragically hit my country again, with more than 100 000 hectares of forest burnt. Worst hit has been the Serra Algarvia region, where many families, whose incomes depended on forest products, have been plunged into serious poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of preserving forest heritage, due to its environmental, economic, social and cultural importance, and given the extent of this disaster, what is essential is not only European solidarity and assistance, but also significant investment, Community investment, in reforestation, in research, in coordination, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the area of civil protection, and in funding aerial means of combating forest fires. We therefore urge, once again, that our proposals and Parliament’s proposals be complied with, thereby strengthening the element of fire prevention and the relevant funding within the scope of the ‘Forest Focus’ programme, in accordance with the previous Regulation 2158/92. We are aware, however, that if we are to solve this problem, we must change the common agricultural policy in order to combat human and economic abandonment of rural areas, since it is the main cause of an agriculture and forestry policy that encourages people to abandon the countryside and prevents these forest areas from surviving economically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst it is true that this year’s fires were not as devastating as last year’s, they ought still to be a concern for everyone. In my country, Portugal, this is partly because last year, around 11% of Portuguese forest territory was destroyed. In other words, what is already burnt cannot be burnt again.</p>
<p class="contents">The emergency aid approved by Parliament last year, which helped to bolster the resources made available by the government, made a difference. It was a genuine expression of European solidarity with Portugal at a time of suffering for so many Portuguese people. A significant part of Europe’s forest heritage cannot be destroyed year upon year with total impunity. Quite apart from its relevance for the whole of Europe, the Mediterranean forest is essential to the regional and local economy, to job creation, to the safeguarding of a territory and to the quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that there are environmental reasons, related to climate change and to global warming. It is a fact that average temperatures are rising and that the number of days with high temperatures and low humidity is also on the increase. We are also aware that criminal acts are often the cause of these disasters. In many cases, however, the disasters are the result of a lack of prevention and an absence of adequate resources to fight the flames.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned by, among others, Mrs Herranz Garcia, Parliament set an example when it debated ‘Forest Focus’, which laid down the need to provide the resources to prevent forest fires. Better resources are required, both in prevention and in European civil protection assistance and cooperation in the use of major resources, to which you so aptly referred in your speech, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I should like to mention something to which we alluded last year and to which we shall probably always allude whenever such circumstances arise: the dedication of the fire-fighters, the dedication of the people who, through their acts of courage, generosity and even heroism, proved what we already know – that in times of tragedy that demonstrate the worst in human nature, there are also many people who demonstrate the best in human nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This summer’s fires, in the case of Portugal, devastated more than 100 000 hectares, in addition to last year’s disaster. The Algarve was the worst hit area, with 40% of its total area burnt. What we are witnessing is a veritable environmental, economic and human tragedy that has become a public catastrophe. It is therefore a matter of urgency that we hold a debate on fire prevention measures, backed by real investment. Otherwise, in a few generations’ time, there may be no forests. The Mediterranean forest is part of the common heritage of the people of Europe and must therefore be preserved. Some of the cork trees burnt were over two hundred years old and most were between one hundred and two hundred years old. Some EUR 80 million of damage was caused and replacing these trees would take approximately one hundred years. The tendency these days is to channel more funds into addressing the consequences of natural disasters than into preventing them. We do not have an unlimited capacity to repair damage and prevention requires political courage and coherent regional development. I ask the Commission to show that courage in the face of this tragedy and to table here a restructuring and reorganisation of the Structural Funds, so that these people can see on the horizon at least the possibility of rebuilding their livelihoods to pass on to their grandchildren. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no complex strategy, though it is a complex interdisciplinary problem requiring cooperation amongst institutions. It is the job, moreover, of us politicians to solve complex and difficult problems. To this end, I believe we must create a model for the management of risks, for management and cooperation, because we are faced with issues ranging from judicial procedures, because there is a lot of terrorism, to the issues of policing, the civil population and the local authorities. We must create models, as was done for Agenda 21. The European Union is capable of doing this. Above all, I am concerned, however, about the need for shared effective technological development, because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European Commission must do what the countries or the regions cannot do. The problem of technological development is extremely important, in terms, for example, of the transfer of military technology, the development of the GIS and many other things that are being applied in some regions very successfully and which require technology shared amongst the 25 countries, amongst all the regions and amongst all the local authorities, because it is clear that, without that technological progress, all we can hope for is human effort and a lot of good will, but little success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 96% of cases, the causes are attributable to man, and that is why the Spanish Government has announced a series of measures, including stiffer penalties for this crime and a ban on building in the areas in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither must we forget other causes, as has already been pointed out. The change in the socio-economic structures of rural areas seems to be the most fundamental one, but also the lack of success of European forest and rural development policy. The majority of fires start in forests which are uncared-for, as a result of the abandonment of traditional agricultural activity, the ageing of the population and the demographic crisis. The EAGGF funds or the rural development policy cannot, however, carry the whole burden of this serious problem, Mrs Wallström. The serious environmental consequences of forest fires make European action necessary. The difficulties you are aware of in the application of the Solidarity Fund should be alleviated through the creation of a specific rapid intervention mechanism in the event of these disasters of a smaller scale and involving lesser sums than those provided for by the Solidarity Fund. Furthermore, and at the same time, European forest policy should be reoriented, recognising the special nature of southern forests and creating a specific plan for their protection and for the complete environmental recovery of the burnt areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying something – and I hope it is not taken the wrong way: I believe that party politics should be left out of this debate and that we should seek consensus amongst all of us. Otherwise – in Galicia it rains and in Andalusia it does not – certain Members should perhaps start to ask themselves what the EUR 820 million Commissioner Wallström has mentioned has been spent on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, and even though the effects of fires continue to be too serious and disastrous, the fires which have affected, in particular, the southern Member States of the EU this year have been less fierce, and there has been no summer heatwave causing thousands of deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, the European Union set up a Solidarity Fund intended to deal with natural disasters of this kind and their consequences for our peoples. Last year, this Fund helped to deal with the aftermath of the fires in southern Europe. In late 2003, the Forest Focus Regulation was adopted, but it was allocated only EUR 9 million of funding for the 2003-2006 period, which is not enough to prevent fires. In the long run, there are plans for cofinancing via the common agricultural policy and the rural development fund, which means a partial withdrawal from the EU’s forestry policy. What image of solidarity do we wish to present to our fellow citizens, especially those from the South?</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem facing us is the role of forests in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. Not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive CO2 emissions, they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the Union’s carbon sink capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue, and rightly so, to express our dismay at the fires and other natural disasters which have affected all of Europe over the past few years. We cannot, however, show our solidarity with words alone. Words are never enough. Action is necessary and must be taken to greatly reduce the scale of forest fires and of other natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a matter of urgency: we must reduce these disasters and show our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that climate change will probably increase these types of extreme weather events and it is quite probable that we will see more of these problems occurring, as the International Panel of Climate Change has told us. That underlines the responsibility that is shared between the different levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the Commission and the institutions will have to act in a coordinated way to ensure that we have the necessary capacity. Member States will also have to be sure that they have done everything for prevention and that we have a higher level of preparedness to deal with these forest fires, extreme weather events and catastrophes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of resources – such as fire brigades – and being able to mobilise them quickly. It is also a matter of having resources for prevention activities. So there is a whole spectrum of activities and responsibilities. We are addressing that. You know as well as the Commission does that Member States in general are very reluctant to engage in a debate on a common forest policy for Europe, so we are also touching upon very sensitive political issues and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we set aside more money, it is not always true that this would help immediately, unless there is better coordination of activities, unless there is better planning for prevention and preparedness on the part also of Member States. I just want to underline that as welcome as more money is, it is not always a matter of only having more money; there also has to be better planning and coordination in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for this valuable debate on an issue that we risk having to raise again in the near future. I appreciate the interest you show in finding common solutions to prevent forest fires, to fight them and also to mitigate the damage they cause – because the funding has often been a matter of mitigating and trying to come in after the damage has been done – as well as to help Member States restore their potential for forestry production.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted several suggestions that I will also take into due consideration after this plenary part-session and there will be a follow-up. I believe we could further increase transparency concerning the application of existing instruments. We will also examine the need for additional prevention measures when implementing the Forest Focus regulation as we will do when considering the proposal for the Council's Rural Development regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As a first modest step, next November the Commission will hold a conference entitled 'Citizen participation from restoration to prevention – good governance for the restoration campaign to follow forest fires in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and Cyprus'. So it will also take into account the experience that we have gathered. It will focus on restoration and involvement of civil society because, as you said, the causes can be anything from climate change to the human factor.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek to identify the lessons learned from last year's events, raise awareness among citizens and local and regional authorities, and collect suggestions for the future. So there is also work to do to improve our activities in this field. I am happy that we have found today a common view on possible actions that we should focus on for the future. I once again thank you for this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
