<p class="contents">The result of 97% of votes in favour of the Government was reached without counting votes, with a dubious census, with the opposition leaders in prison and without freedom of expression throughout the campaign, and with no freedom to vote in secret on election day, when the voting tables were presided over by the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections from which, in the face of so much disaster and outrage, the opposition parties withdrew. In short, fraudulent and invalid elections, the results of which should not be recognised by the international community, with the European Union taking the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, recalling that this is the fifth European Parliament resolution on human rights in Guinea, and taking into account the statement made by the Presidency of the Union on the elections in Guinea, the Socialist Group asks the institutions of the European Union to use every means possible to ensure that a peaceful transmission to democracy is initiated in Equatorial Guinea, that political prisoners are immediately released and that the international commitments made by President Obiang are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we attach a great deal of importance to paragraph 7 of our Joint Resolution, which states ‘Asks the Commission to draw up a report on the impact on democracy and human rights of the policies of the oil companies operating in Equatorial Guinea’. We are talking about a country that has oil, the income from which goes to President Obiang, his family and friends, but not to the population of Guinea. One third of the population has a life expectancy of 40 years and 57% do not have access to drinking water.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, perhaps we need to promote, in the United Nations Security Council, an embargo on Guinean oil and, perhaps, now that there are four Member States of the European Union that are part of the Security Council, one of its agreed actions could be monitoring the democratisation processes in a series of countries and promoting appropriate measures in order to encourage the necessary changes, in accordance with the priorities stated by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to say ‘that is enough’ to the countries in which only a minority benefits from the resources while the rest of the population continues to live in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, we consider that this Resolution is very good and positive in terms of achieving something that is among the priorities for Parliament and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The trial held last spring, which ended in the conviction of 68 people, showed that there are no legal guarantees that can be backed up internationally, as was clear in the declaration made by this House in June. The trial broke off what was slow but positive progress, which is reprehensible. However, it should not be forgotten that it is not always the best solution to shut off channels of communication with a country that is in deficit when it comes to respecting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that we should maintain a critical dialogue, seeking to make gradual progress. We need to strongly condemn abuses, but we should also acknowledge steps forward when they are made, for example, the freeing of 120 people who had been in prison for some time on 12 October in honour of the 34th anniversary of the independence of Guinea. I am of course aware that this is not enough, but we must recognise that it took place.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the slow pace of the democratisation process, it should be criticised that four opposition candidates had to withdraw on the day of the presidential elections due to irregularities in the votes, even though the electoral campaign had run without any serious incidents. Of course we cannot forget that members of significant parties are being detained or are in exile, such as Severo Moto, the president of the banned Progress Party, who is in exile in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that the next elections, the legislative elections planned in a few months’ time, will be held with more guarantees and freedom. Therefore, in the Resolution being debated today the Guinean Government should be invited to take measures to give credibility to its will to make the system democratic, establishing a serious dialogue with absolutely all of the political movements. At the same time, the political movements should avoid making speeches like those made by the four candidates who withdrew, which could lead to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to criticise what there is to criticise, but help progress to continue. We cannot therefore support this Resolution, because it is simply a head-on attack on the Guinean Government, which could have counterproductive results and not benefit the people of Guinea or lead towards a democratisation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When a president is elected with 97% of the votes, the elections are unsound. The so–called struggle at the ballot box, which resulted in President Obiang holding on to power, was a farce. This is exactly what we would expect from a government that for years has failed to comply with international recommendations to introduce a democratic order. The United Nations and European Union missions to observe the elections were not welcome. The secretary–general of the largest opposition party was arrested. The opposition leaders were subjected to unfair trials in the spring. Not surprisingly, all the other candidates apart from the sitting president withdrew from the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Equatorial Guinea is the umpteenth poverty–stricken African country in which someone is clinging on to power, enriching himself, violating human rights and completely ignoring the international community. The European Union must engage vigorously in the political dialogue. Any pledge under the ninth European Development Fund is completely out of the question unless the situation improves dramatically. Even if this situation does improve, in the context of democratisation or capacity building, this regime will claim that this gives them legitimacy. This political abuse cannot be tolerated. The opposition leaders and all other political prisoners must be released immediately. The elections must be declared null and void, and new ones therefore need to be organised. There must be an international investigation into the way the oil companies operate and the president’s role in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Democratisation is a necessary precondition for effectively counteracting poverty. Poverty in African countries is not only caused by globalisation, restricted access to markets or inadequate aid. Many African countries mess things up themselves. Equatorial Guinea is one of those countries in which development is stagnating because of the abuse of power. Those poor people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must recognise quite clearly that we have a very substantial responsibility here. Of course, there are abuses of power, corruption, and dictatorial violations of any attempt at the rule of law in that country. That is absolutely correct and we must vigorously condemn them.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet on the other hand, we ourselves have a responsibility, because this country – like many other African countries – has become a pawn in the international competition for resources, and unfortunately, this involves European interests as well. The major role played by the oil companies in Equatorial Guinea, but also the diamond trade – and illegal trades such as human trafficking play a part there too – unfortunately destabilise the country as well. Ethnic and political conflicts – although these are generally rooted in ethnic conflicts – are exploited in a cynical policy designed to safeguard resource supplies. For this reason, I think that paragraph 7 of the resolution is extremely important, for we have a responsibility here, and we also have opportunities to exert influence. We genuinely need the proposed report on the oil companies' role.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not endorse the call for an outright boycott and the cessation of all financial assistance. As a rule, such measures impact not on the dictators, but – if they have any impact at all – on the people of this already benighted country. I completely agree with my Spanish colleague on this point. I believe that we must vigorously condemn the abuse of power. Nonetheless, we must also seek dialogue with President Obiang in order to achieve a situation in which the opposition can gradually resume its work and the exiled politicians can return home. We must also work to ensure that the planned conference on reforming the judicial system can take place. Unless we start with very basic institution–building in this country – as we sought to do in European countries, as in Kosovo and Bosnia–Herzegovina, where conditions are far more straightforward and stable – we will never achieve any success.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot apply European standards overnight in Equatorial Guinea; this will take decades of development, which have yet to commence. This is why, as I have already said, the next steps are dialogue with President Obiang, supporting the conference on the judicial system, the release of the opposition, legalising opposition parties, and fresh elections with international supervision. These are the next steps we must take, but it would be disastrous if we now tried to run before we could walk. I therefore recommend a measured approach. Simply imposing sanctions is not a solution. Above all, we should not point the finger at others; we should accept our own responsibility first, and that means examining the role played by our oil companies in what is sadly a very dirty game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In terms that are sure to please Commissioner Solbes, who deals with economic and monetary affairs, the deficit is such that the Government of Guinea is simply bankrupt in this respect. Not only is it bankrupt, but it is also continually failing to comply with each and every one of the commitments made, first of all to the European Union and, in general, to the international community in terms of moving towards the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent elections were a clear example of the fact that Mr Obiang does not want democracy or human rights in his country. An even more dramatic example was the trial of the opposition which resulted not only in political prisoners but also in deaths due to torture at <span class="italic">Black Beach </span>prison, which we have condemned in this House on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a responsibility towards democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea and some of its Member States have a twofold responsibility. Two of them are currently sitting on the Security Council: France and Spain. I therefore feel that it is essential that the European Union – why not at the suggestion of those countries? – approve a joint action to commit itself to democracy and human rights, and also that it talk to another country that is extraordinarily interested in Guinea, not due to these matters, but because of oil, that is the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore highly important that we retain the paragraph of the Resolution regarding a code of conduct for the oil companies, as we cannot allow them to act without one. Oil, the great resource that is draining the citizens of Equatorial Guinea, is now the crux of the matter and the source of the strength of President Obiang Nguema’s regime. The European Union therefore needs to act firmly; let us adopt this common action, let us talk with the United States, let us make an agreement with Washington and let us also call on the oil companies to fulfil their obligations, quite simply to comply with their obligations towards people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to assess what is happening with oil in Equatorial Guinea. I would even ask for more, I would ask the Commission to consider reopening its office in Malabo. The United States are going to reopen their Embassy. Why? For oil. Let us reopen our office. Why? For human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Socialists therefore entirely support this Resolution, because it will be well received by those who, like Celestino Bacale, the CPDS presidential candidate, who brought thousands of supporters together at campaign meetings, will be able to say: the European Union is with us, like President Cox, who in his time spoke clearly and firmly in favour of democracy and human rights in Guinea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that the situation has deteriorated considerably in the past year and that the slightly positive progress that seemed to be taking place up until the end of 2001 has been halted. This deterioration casts doubt on whether President Obiang’s regime has a genuine desire for democratisation and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share your doubts and your assessment of the elections on 15 December, which were called early, breaching the provisions of the Constitution and preventing electoral observers from attending. They obviously cannot be described as democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the general pardon issued by President Obiang in October should be applied to all of the political opponents detained in spring 2002 and convicted in unsafe trials.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in agreement regarding cooperation with Equatorial Guinea, which is very dependent on the problems in the democratisation process and on the progress of human rights in the country. Cooperation was blocked for several years, and five years ago partial cooperation began. It is true that the National Indicative Programme of the eighth European Development Fund, signed in July 2000, highlighted support for democracy, human rights, civil society and the rule of law as a priority area in which we should act. It also establishes that providing European funds for other measures is subject to visible efforts by the Guinean Government in this area. We are therefore aiming to promote democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to paragraph 7 of your Resolution, I would like to point out that in October the Commission proposed to the Government of Equatorial Guinea that a mission should be conducted to evaluate the overall application of activities associated with consolidating the rule of law and promoting and respecting human rights, as laid down in the cooperation programme. We need to know the progress of that situation and its conclusions in order to make any decision on continuing cooperation activities in that country and, in particular, in order to sign the new National Indicative Programme for the ninth EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission considers, as some of you have said, that we need to step up our efforts and international pressure in all institutions, particularly, but not solely, in the International Monetary Fund, in order to ensure transparent and efficient management of oil resources, in order to ensure that the increase in these resources translates into an equivalent improvement in the standard of living of the people of Equatorial Guinea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
