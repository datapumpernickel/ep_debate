<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schröder, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three weeks ago today, at about this time, the European Council held its extraordinary meeting in Berlin. Even as we arrived in Berlin, there were growing fears that it would not prove possible to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo. During the days before the Berlin Council, the attacks by the Serbian security forces ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">... against the Albanian ethnic majority had increased massively. President Milosevic used the weeks after Rambouillet and Paris to embark on the systematic expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo. The community of states could not just stand by and watch.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Kosovar Albanians quite rightly expect human rights, the rights to freedom, to their homeland and to inviolability, to apply unconditionally to them too. The European community of values would become an empty phrase if we Europeans allowed the principles on which the European Union is founded to be trampled underfoot in a place just one hour"s flight away from here, that is to say, in the middle of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">These principles are democracy, justice and the rule of law, freedom and solidarity with the weaker members of society. Since the evening of 24 March, the allied air force has been attacking targets in Yugoslavia. That same evening the European Council in Berlin gave its unanimous support to the actions of the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it quite plainly: anyone who violates human rights as brutally as President Milosevic has done must expect a resolute response from us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who with cold‐blooded calculation bases his rule on the misery, the persecution and the murder of part of an ethnic minority must know that the western community of values is prepared to take the ultimate step to prevent an even worse scenario and also to enforce the fundamental values that are its values. It was not with a light heart but only after real and careful consideration of all the arguments that we decided to use military force. I am firmly convinced that there was no alternative to this decision in view of the increasingly tense situation in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of the Kosovo crisis, the resignation of the Commission and Agenda 2000 probably represent the biggest challenges any European Council has ever had to tackle. Each of these tasks in itself would have taken up an entire European summit under normal circumstances. In Berlin we managed to tackle all three challenges at the same time. Berlin – and this must be emphasised – demonstrated more impressively perhaps than any European Council meeting before it that the European Union is capable of action. We are convinced that is the message of the Berlin summit. Europe is without any question living up to its responsibilities. The European Union will not be divided. The signal of the Berlin summit is this: we Europeans speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">We managed to adopt Agenda 2000 on the summit morning of 26 March. With the Berlin package we have found a compromise under which all parties concerned have to make concessions. It is a compromise that is sensible and that we can all live with. That is why it is, in my view, a good and fair agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In Berlin, we nominated Mr Romano Prodi for the office of President of the Commission. With your assent, ladies and gentlemen, by the summer we will again have a fully functioning Commission under undisputedly competent leadership. I am also happy to be able to confirm to you that Berlin has finally paved the way for a trade and cooperation agreement with South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I know that many Members of this House are very committed in their support for the new South Africa. I personally was also very pleased that after all these years of negotiations we finally achieved this breakthrough towards the end of President Mandela"s term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin package on Agenda 2000 creates a viable foundation for European Union action in the coming years and sends out a clear signal to the people of Europe, to the markets, and also to the applicant countries. It signals that the Member States of the European Union were prepared to put their common responsibility above their own national interests. I need not, at this point, discuss the Berlin agreement in detail once more. But let me emphasise that two principles did and still do take precedence: stability of expenditure on the one hand and solidarity with the weaker on the other. We agreed in Berlin that we would also exercise stringent budgetary discipline in Europe in future. At the same time we want to and will maintain cohesion between the Member States, as provided in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that the Member States" original positions on many aspects of Agenda 2000 still diverged very widely up to the time of the summit. I will remember that night in Berlin as one of the most difficult and lengthiest negotiations I have ever had to conduct. As German Chancellor, I left no doubt in Berlin that my country would be prepared to subordinate its rightful national interests to a reasonable overall solution. This approach based on European responsibility paved the way to an adequate solution. In the end all the partners were more interested in achieving European added value than in asserting their potential own interests in individual cases. This made it possible to reach a compromise that paves the European Union"s way into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament – that is to say, you – were closely and constructively involved in the preliminary work on Agenda 2000 up to the summit, sometimes under great pressure of deadlines. I would like to express my very real gratitude to you for this commitment and the accompanying flexibility and willingness to seek joint solutions, and at the same time to ask you: please do all you can to bring the ongoing legislative procedures to a speedy conclusion as quickly as possible. The implementation of the Berlin package is not just the condition for further steps in the enlargement process. The uninterrupted continuation of structural aid after the end of the year would also be at risk if we did not cooperate rapidly. Against this background, I hope it will prove possible to adopt the necessary legal acts quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens, the people of Europe, want integration. Our common Europe has long since become a reality in terms of good neighbourliness, of countless cultural, economic and social links. At the same time the people of Europe are rightly urging us to make the European institutions capable of action now and in the future. They have no sympathy for any inefficiency in transposing Community policies and expect all concerned to show the highest personal integrity. Following the mass resignation of the Commission under Mr Jacques Santer, the European Union risked facing a serious institutional crisis. By rapidly nominating Mr Romano Prodi on the very first morning of the Berlin summit, the European Council made an important contribution to preventing the looming crisis. That too is a major and lasting success of the Berlin summit. While I was still in Berlin, I informed the President of the European Parliament of this nomination, in my capacity of President of the European Council. I also took that opportunity to point out that he must certainly be appointed under the procedure provided to that effect in the Amsterdam Treaty. Today I would ask you to deliver your vote on the future President of the Commission in good time, so that the entire Commission can be appointed before the end of this summer following the selection of members of the college by the President‐designate and the Member State governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has clearly gained in stature over the past months. I am confident that the people of Europe will reward this by a high level of participation in the elections on 10‐13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, the EU Heads of State and Government will be holding an informal meeting in Brussels. It will begin with an in‐depth discussion of current progress on the Kosovo issue. I will be returning to that at the end of my statement. During the second part of the meeting, we will start discussing the Commission"s future working procedures with Mr Romano Prodi. We are firmly convinced that the European Union needs a strong Commission that really can live up to the requirements of efficiency, transparency and – quite crucially – closeness to the people. That is why we will ask Mr Prodi, the Commission President‐designate, to draw up a programme, on the basis also of discussions with the European Parliament and the Member States, which clearly defines the Commission"s changed working procedures. Some of the improvements here will require a revision of the Treaty. To that end we should use the opportunity of the intergovernmental conference that is in any case scheduled to resolve the institutional questions that remained outstanding in Amsterdam. I will suggest to my colleagues that they should adopt the timetable for this intergovernmental conference, which if possible should take place by next year, at the European Council in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in retrospect the last few years will prove to have been good years for the European Union, for European policy. The introduction of the euro was a major step towards integration.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The countries involved took a sovereign political decision to pass on a national responsibility for a central aspect of their economic policy to a European institution. Among other things, the Amsterdam Treaty laid the foundation stone for a common justice and home affairs policy and for a common and viable foreign and security policy for the Union. The European Parliament acquired much‐improved codecision rights. The enlargement process was set in motion and we have opened accession negotiations with the best‐prepared applicants, in the awareness also that European integration can succeed only if Europe does not stop at the borders of what used to be the iron curtain. All of this, as also the adoption of Agenda 2000 in Berlin, was also achieved thanks to the outgoing Commission under Mr Jacques Santer.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Whatever criticism there has been, and however well‐founded it may have been, I want to repeat my warm thanks to Mr Jacques Santer and the college at this point!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Once again we are facing major tasks. They can only be mastered by a strong Commission that is able to act. In the person of Mr Romano Prodi the Heads of State and Government have appointed a candidate for the office of President of the Commission who, I am firmly convinced, fulfils all the requirements for mastering these tasks together with us and with you. Even before the Kosovo situation began to worsen, we knew that the EU"s common foreign and security policy needs to be further strengthened. The Amsterdam Treaty that will enter into force on 1 May brings definite improvements in that direction. At the European Council in Cologne we intend to appoint the future high representative for the common foreign and security policy. We need to definitely intensify cooperation in the field of security and defence policy. With the adoption of a cross‐pillar common strategy on Russia, we want to send out an unmistakeable signal that the European Union wants to further expand its relations with Russia and will do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a quality of cooperation with Russia which we for our part will certainly not call in question again. We welcome the Russian endeavours, in the current crisis, to exert a positive influence on Belgrade. I am in close contact with President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov. Russia – I am convinced – is a central factor of stability in Europe and we must ensure that it is and remains in a position to advance along the road to reform on which it has embarked. Here the European Union remains prepared to cooperate. Indeed, where at all possible, it would like to intensify this cooperation. As I have learned from talks I have held, this is also recognised in Russia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we need tangible improvements in EU cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs. Here too the Amsterdam Treaty opens up new opportunities and potential, which we want to grasp courageously. A first test of this will be whether we manage to treat the Kosovar refugees who come into the European Union generously and on a basis of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Combating mass unemployment has to be a central concern of the European Union. We must find ways of maintaining social cohesion and the European social model even under the conditions of the global competition of the 21st century. Important work was done in preparation for the launch of the euro in the field of economic policy. But we should not focus on a one‐sided, purely doctrinal stability policy. In the long term we would not be able to convey it to our citizens in political terms. In Cologne we therefore want to supplement the stability and growth pact, which we continue to uphold, with a European employment pact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">One important task for the future remains enlarging the European Union to the east and the south. Unless the Union is open to new Member States, in the long term European integration would remain a half‐baked project and would fail for lack of a political rationale.</p>
<p class="contents">But, ladies and gentlemen, there is also a lesson to be learnt from the Kosovo crisis in relation to the applicant countries. Some of them have now found stability in their external and security policy within NATO. But what they want and what they need is for this stability also to be backed up by economic stability. That is the reason they want to join the EU, and quite sensibly so. In relation to the existing Member States, it should be said that they too have a very real interest in enlargement. The lesson of Yugoslavia is that peace on this continent is only possible if economic and social development can and does advance throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Under the German Presidency we have made headway with the ongoing accession negotiations. The European Council in Berlin sent out a message to the applicant countries once again confirming that the enlargement process will resolutely go ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of Agenda 2000 we have created a further condition for achieving that. The aim of the intergovernmental conference on key institutional questions, to which I referred earlier, is to ensure that the European Union definitively removes the last possible barrier to the accession of new Member States. Then it will be up to the applicant states to fulfil the requirements of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . We will continue in future to support them in this with all our strength. I want to put it clearly on the record that the progress made so far by the applicant countries is impressive and really does give grounds for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude what I have to say, let me come back again to the situation in Kosovo. You will be discussing the development of the conflict today, which I very much welcome. Europe must speak with a strong voice in times such as this and the words must be spoken not just by members of the governments and national parliaments. As an expression of the new Europe, Parliament too must take a definite position, in favour of peace, stability and respect for human rights in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The dreadful developments in Kosovo are not an internal Yugoslav problem. They affect us all! Good neighbourliness and justice do not end at national frontiers. We bear common responsibility for our continent. There cannot and must not be any excuse whatsoever for a cynical policy of driving out, indeed of deporting hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">One million people have had to leave their houses and homes or were driven out by Serbian security forces, 500 000 of them since March alone. There are more than 300 000 refugees from Kosovo in Albania. The small country of Macedonia is also in an extremely difficult position. That is why the EU Member States launched a large‐scale aid operation jointly with other states. We want to alleviate the plight of the refugees and we want to show solidarity with the neighbouring states. That is why the Council decided last Thursday to earmark EUR 150 million for humanitarian aid to the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We will support the main host countries, Albania and Macedonia, together with the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, with another EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling: So will we!) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Very good! The Council has also requested the Commission to submit proposals on further tightening the European Union"s relations with Macedonia, looking even to a potential association agreement. The extremist Belgrade leadership bears sole responsibility for the situation that has arisen. The decision to put a lasting and verifiable end to the operations of the military and security forces and to allow the refugees to return is in its hands. Mere cease‐fire declarations, which are not meant seriously and which we know from the wars in Croatia and in Bosnia‐Herzegovina to be lies, are not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Belgrade must immediately take verifiable steps to resolve the conflict. In addition to a genuine cease‐fire, that means the withdrawal of all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, including the infamous bands of paramilitaries, the return of the refugees and the deployment of international troops to protect the refugees and the population.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kofi Annan, the Secretary‐General of the United Nations, who will be a guest at the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government this evening in Brussels, also supports this demand. It is now up to the Yugoslav side to accept the demands of the international community unconditionally and to implement them at once. That and that alone would open the way to a political settlement of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The western alliance is not just fighting in the Balkans to prevent suffering and to secure justice and the rule of law in the Balkans. The credibility and validity of the European model of civilisation are also at stake. The Belgrade regime is waging war against its own population. That is why the democratic and constitutional societies of Europe had to oppose the totalitarian regime in Belgrade. The ‘European integration" model of the future is confronted with a hermetic concept of ethnic nationalism, which leaves no room for minorities and different opinions. You could say, if you like, that the 21st century is confronting the 19th century.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking further ahead, there can therefore only be one future for the states and peoples of the region. If we want to help democracy to become established there on a lasting basis and win over the people of the region – and here I definitely include the people of Yugoslavia – for the European model, we have to offer them a European prospect.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">By that I do not mean early accession to the European Union, which would in any case place too heavy a burden on these countries. I am thinking far more of a comprehensive regional strategy, of a kind of stability pact for the Balkan region. The aim of that kind of strategy is to pave the way to establishing links with the European Union, with the single market and with the European community of values. The German Presidency has submitted a proposal to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to determine, through resolute action, under what auspices Europe will end this bloody century of national egoism and inflated ideology. It is our duty to bring about the definitive, irreversible advance of democracy, human rights and cross‐frontier cooperation throughout Europe. Wherever the plight of the people in this region requires it, we will be generous and give real proof of our solidarity with the weak.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us tackle this task together, in the name of Europe, in the name of its people and in the name of its values! Many thanks for your attention!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santer, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July 1997, I presented Agenda 2000 to this House, one of the largest packages of reforms in the history of the Union. On that occasion, I stated that it represented an historic opportunity to strengthen the Union and prepare for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I am extremely pleased that the Berlin European Council was able to successfully meet this challenge. This outcome would not have been possible without strong independent institutions that are capable of taking action. Of course, the negotiations on Agenda 2000 have been complex and difficult. We had to continue with the agricultural reforms launched in 1992 and maintain the essential elements of economic and social cohesion, whilst taking enlargement and the financial constraints into account.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, negotiations began on the basis of legislative proposals put forward by the Commission, and these negotiations developed satisfactorily under the British and Austrian Presidencies. The negotiations were completed in Berlin thanks to the German Chancellor and I should like to pay tribute to him on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the work is not yet finished. There is still some legislative work to be completed before the end of your parliamentary term. We must also negotiate the interinstitutional agreement, to which you quite rightly attach so much importance. But the Berlin agreement has created the political bases needed to complete a package of measures that I would describe as ‘ambitious". I am well aware that there will be disappointment over some points here and there but, overall, there is every reason to welcome an agreement that falls within the guidelines followed by the Commission since 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agriculture is concerned, we needed to preserve competitiveness and the exporting role of this increasingly multifunctional sector while developing rural areas. It is common knowledge that the Commission would have liked to have gone a little further down the path of reform. Nonetheless, I believe that Agenda 2000 was a real step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the common organisation of markets, the idea of price reductions with partial compensation has been upheld. Our proposals for rural development have been adopted as they stand. The issue here is to adjust the scale of such development. These reforms will allow us to strengthen agriculture whilst remaining within a rigorous financial framework for the whole of the new period. They will also smooth the way for enlargement and for an agreement within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second major category of expenditure, namely structural operations, our objective was to preserve economic and social cohesion whilst achieving greater concentration of available resources. The Commission felt it was crucial to maintain the levels of aid that were achieved in 1999 for the most affected regions and social groups. We succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we had to resolve certain specific problems. Rather than distorting the objective criteria for allocating resources, the European Council decided to set aside a small proportion of the budget within the overall budget to deal with such cases in the appropriate manner. The main principles behind the proposed reforms were therefore also maintained, although this has indeed led to a somewhat tedious listing of ad hoc solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Agenda 2000 communication, proposed by the Commission, set out to provide the Union with the means it needed to create the appropriate conditions for lasting growth that generated employment. To this end, the Commission wished to strengthen heading 3 on internal policies. The amount decided on in Berlin is at the bottom end of the bracket proposed by the presidency. I have often drawn the Council"s attention to the importance this House attaches to heading 3, and I am sure that you will succeed in raising our ambitions during the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The last element as far as expenditure is concerned is administrative expenditure. In Agenda 2000, the Commission had already begun to consider its own reform. In this context, the issue of balancing political objectives and administrative resources is of the utmost importance. As far as heading 5 is concerned, even though the amounts decided on in Berlin are at the top end of the bracket proposed by the presidency, they will barely allow staffing levels in the institutions to remain constant. This is unsatisfactory. Here, again, the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement will allow Parliament to try to change this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Union will not continue to develop with the current 15 Member States alone. Intensive preparations are underway to enlarge the Union to include our friends and neighbours. In Agenda 2000, the Commission had suggested setting aside a considerable part of the financial package for the pre‐accession process and future enlargement. I see that our proposals, the equivalent of a real Marshall Plan, have been adopted in their entirety in this package, and we are talking here of a sum of EUR 80 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">We had to combine the two objectives of deepening and widening the Union within a strict, efficient and equitable financial framework. The Berlin agreement must now lead to an interinstitutional agreement that will help guarantee budgetary discipline within ceilings established by rigorous but realistic financial perspectives. As far as the Union is concerned, commitments will stabilise in 2006 at a level lower than that forecast for the year 2000, and this will involve considerable efforts to reduce expenditure. By stabilising the expenditure for 15 countries, we will create the necessary margins within the own resources ceilings that will allow us to welcome new members between 2000 and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is also solidarity. We have finally been able to reach an agreement on own resources that will lead to a more equitable system. Partially replacing the VAT resource with the GNP‐based resource will ensure that Member State"s contributions are more in line with their ability to contribute. The change in the financing of the British rebate will remove some of the burden from the countries with the greatest budgetary imbalances, without introducing new corrective mechanisms. Before the end of the new financial perspective, the Commission will have the opportunity to once again examine the own resources system, including the effects of enlargement and the question of new autonomous own resources, something that is close to Parliament"s heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the agreement reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000 is a success and it is a success for the Union. I am counting on Parliament to provide the few corrections needed. Once again, the Union has shown that it can find solutions to enable Europe to progress. I am not hiding my personal satisfaction at having been able to contribute, along with my colleagues in the Commission, to such a positive outcome. We have thus come to the end of the cycle of important deadlines that I presented to you on 17 January 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President‐in‐Office has just described the situation in Kosovo in detail so I will only add a few words. We are clearly very worried about the events in Kosovo. I will not go back over the origins of this situation except to point out that it is entirely the product of the Belgrade government"s refusal to accept any negotiated settlement. The representatives of the international community, and of Europe in particular, stepped up their efforts to find a peaceful and just solution for Kosovo, a solution that was just for all, for those of Albanian origin and for the Serb nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those efforts failed and the current military action hopes to use force to ensure that the principles and values forming Europe"s <span class="italic">raison d"être</span> are respected. To take no action would be to accept this situation and Europe and its partners will not accept murders, will not accept deportations and will not accept terror and hatred amongst peoples. Europe and its partners, allied in this difficult military action, have clearly laid down their demands. The international community is now taking action to make the leaders in Belgrade put an end to the suppression, allow the return of refugees and accept the presence of an international force. In time, stability in the Balkans will have to be the subject of a far‐reaching initiative, which was already outlined by the presidency at the last General Affairs Council. The Commission will fully support such an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, Europe is faced with a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions. The neighbouring regions of Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are affected most. We must also give consideration to the displaced persons within Kosovo. The Commission immediately attempted to make use of Community resources to respond to the most pressing needs. As always, we are working in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, you will be aware that, during a special meeting, the Commission adopted two far‐reaching initiatives which it has forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council. The first requirement was to prepare to mobilise additional resources for humanitarian aid. A request has been passed on to the budgetary authority for EUR 150 million to be transferred from the emergency reserve in the ECHO budget line. With these EUR 150 million, the Community will have released EUR 180 million from the 1999 budget for humanitarian aid for the refugees in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission believes that we should provide assistance to the neighbouring regions of Kosovo that are taking in refugees. These regions are, first and foremost, Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro, but other areas could also be eligible if they take in a high number of refugees. We are fully aware that massive flows of refugees into a country places heavy demands on its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore plans to allocate up to EUR 100 million to help finance costs directly involved in taking in refugees: providing security for them, administrative costs, additional transport costs, electricity, water supplies, and so on. A mission from the Commission is currently in the region to analyse what is needed. I must point out that this aid will only be granted if the beneficiaries fulfil the international obligations incumbent upon them, particularly under the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">This specific aid to third countries is fully in line with the decision taken to provide particular assistance for the refugees entering Kosovo"s neighbouring regions on a temporary basis. However, in this respect, I must mention that there is the possibility that the Member States may decide to take in refugees on a temporary basis, in response to appeals from the UNHCR. To enable the Community budget to support these Member States, the Commission has amended its proposal for a joint action to allow us to make use of the European Refugee Fund. This will allow us to draw on the European Refugee Fund, a fund which, I would remind you, holds EUR 15 million. This amendment takes account of the new situation created by the war in Kosovo. Parliament has supported it and we are now waiting for the Council to give its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these operations, we need Parliament"s full cooperation. As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, there are no difficulties in using the emergency reserve. As regards the aid of EUR 100 million designed to finance the cost of taking in refugees in Kosovo"s neighbouring regions, the situation has proved to be rather more complex. The Commission"s main aim in this case is to rapidly mobilise these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to another important point that I must mention, namely, the additional staff the Commission will require for these new operations. I believe that Parliament is well aware that the Commission must have the necessary resources to perform its tasks under favourable conditions. We can no longer continue to say that the cavalry is coming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will need additional personnel in Brussels and in its delegations to deal with these new operations and with the subsequent restructuring needs. What is more, it will need technical and administrative assistance on site. As a result, in the very short term, the Commission will have to continue to redeploy its staff, but that will not be enough. We will need extra staff in the next financial year, for both this sector and others. The current situation once again highlights the fact that the Commission must have additional staff to perform the tasks required of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication that was forwarded to you last week mentions this lack of financial and human resources, and I am counting on Parliament and on the Council to take these constraints into consideration. Each institution must contribute and help Europe respond to this crisis in an efficient and responsible manner. I believe that your debates on these two central issues – financial requirements and human resources – must reach the obvious conclusion.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hänsch </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin on a personal note. I am happy to be the first speaker for my group to welcome the German Chancellor as President‐in‐Office of the European Council to the European Parliament; everyone will understand that as a Social Democrat I am particularly glad to do so, especially following the statement you have just made, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Rarely has a presidency of the Council had to take such important decisions as you have in the first three months of this presidency"s term of office, and whatever people may think of particular aspects of the decisions, one thing has become clear: our European Union has proved its ability to act, for which we thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">Under your presidency the European Council nominated a candidate for the post of President of the Commission in the space of one hour, a process that dragged on over more than two summit conferences five years ago. That is certainly worth something in this Union. We will now ensure that we approve Mr Prodi"s appointment during this electoral term of Parliament – i.e. in May – and that we vote on the entire Commission by early September at the latest. I think that tallies with your timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, the resignation of the Commission was not an institutional crisis, quite the contrary. I see it as a step towards European normality. Surely it is normal for Parliament to control and sanction, and surely it is and will remain normal in future too for the EU bodies to assume political responsibility for inadequacies and mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this has now happened for the first time also deserves our respect. What we need now is a radical reform of the administrative structure and the administrative culture in Brussels, and that is not a task just for the new Commission but also for you in the Council and for us in Parliament. We want not a weaker but a stronger Commission. The new Commission must be able to become what it must become, namely a European government.</p>
<p class="contents">It we transfer tasks to the Commission, we must also ensure that it is given the funds for the staff it needs in order to fulfil these tasks. Looking at the financial agreement reached in Berlin, I do not have the impression that the Council has fully realised that yet. In fact we here in Parliament have not fully realised yet either that the Commission has to be given the funds to enable it actually to assume the responsibilities we are transferring to it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 are a compromise, which is only normal, yet in some respects it is a difficult one to accept because some of the compromises that were and had to be reached between national interests will in fact be to the detriment and at the expense of Europe. Over the next few weeks Parliament will subject them to critical and detailed analysis and you may be sure that we will find quite a few things to quibble about in these compromises. I will not go into that in detail now. Let me just say this: the agricultural reform was watered down. You will have to improve on it in a very short time, not just because the reform does not go far enough to cope with enlargement but also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a new financial perspective requires an interinstitutional agreement. We do not want to undo the Berlin financial package, but we want to organise some parts of it in such a way as to make them more consistent with our demands and priorities, e.g. the measures to combat long‐term unemployment and support an active labour market. We want an interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective, we really do want it, but not at any price. After all, this is an agreement, not a dictate. Nevertheless and overall, with Agenda 2000 you have set in motion the greatest reform of EU policies that the EU has ever undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the European Council: we will do our utmost to obtain the necessary majorities for Agenda 2000 in Parliament and to adopt it before the end of this electoral term. We know that it makes up only a part of the reforms needed to make the EU fit for enlargement, which is why I welcome your announcement today that you will determine the timetable for the necessary institutional reforms in Cologne in June. We firmly support you in your intention to conclude this reform process before the first Eastern European country joins the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else we expect of your presidency of the Council. The European Union managed to conclude a pact on stabilising the common currency, which was a good thing. But now it must also manage to conclude a pact on employment, which is an equally good thing. That is why we support your intentions for the Cologne summit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Kosovo: this is a difficult subject for all of us, particularly in my group. We welcome the united support shown by the European Council in Berlin for NATO"s military action. That was another test of the common foreign and security policy, for it showed that Europe is a community of values, not just an economic community. A large majority of my group supports the Member States" position on military action. We regard this action as inevitable, but over and above the limits and necessity of military action, I would like to highlight two or three points. It is true that we have to restrain the criminal Milosevic and his bands of soldiers and murderers. At the end of this bloody century, nationalism and racism must no longer be given a chance in Europe, not anywhere in Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">International law builds on national sovereignty and territorial integrity. These are important values, but no state in Europe may take national sovereignty and territorial integrity as a licence to oppress, displace or commit genocide.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why, over and above the military action that has now become necessary, we need to develop international law further, and we invite you to play your part in doing so. The people of the Balkans will only find peace within a European perspective. We welcome your initiative in calling for a Balkan conference to discuss political, economic and social reconstruction in this stricken region. We firmly support the proposals you made here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say here: we thank the troops from the Member States committed to NATO. We thank them for risking their lives to put an end to the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We also thank the men and women from non‐governmental organisations who are endeavouring, again at the price of great sacrifices, to make the situation of the refugees and displaced persons in this region a little more bearable. They too deserve our thanks.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the European Council, you took over the presidency during one of the most difficult times the European Union has ever had to go through. We wish you success, because that is also our success, the success of our European Union. In the difficult task still ahead of you, we, the European Parliament, and in particular my group, will always be a critical, sometimes perhaps even a highly critical, but always a reliable partner. Many thanks.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brok </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I am convinced that my group too supports you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, in the pursuit of human rights and in the action to protect the people in Kosovo. We know what a heavy responsibility has to be shouldered at a time such as this. And here we certainly must be in a position really to define the aim of the war and to bring the operation to a conclusion. Mrs Doris Pack will be discussing that in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe this should also be a warning to us that we must at last embark on a viable European foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">During the remainder of your term of office until the end of June, it is your task, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, to implement the appropriate provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in relation to key issues. It should not be left to the technocrats. Instead, this potential should be put to real political use, so as to give us a greater ability to act and enable us in future to pursue the kind of foreign policy that will not allow a situation such as that in Kosovo to arise in the first place, that will not mean having to resort to armed force.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">On Berlin, I believe that a number of mistakes were made not <span class="bold">in</span> Berlin but <span class="bold">before</span> Berlin. I agree with you that the choice of Mr Romano Prodi was a good choice. But if the presidency of the Council had cooperated with Parliament on this matter earlier on, in January this year, then we might not have got into this situation at all.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">When I think back to some of the statements made in December last year I am tempted to measure the outcome of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 against what you yourself considered necessary at the time from a German perspective. However, I speak here not as a German representative but on behalf of my group. That is something else you had to learn as President‐in‐Office of the Council: that these are two different things!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we should not undo the Agenda 2000 package. But the European Parliament attaches great value to obtaining margins of manoeuvre in relation to other policies, margins of manoeuvre in foreign and security policy, margins of manoeuvre that would, for instance, also relate to enlargement. After all, the uncertainty in relation to agricultural policy has given rise to new concerns among the applicant countries about time‐scales. We should make it clear that these uncertainties inherent in Agenda 2000 will not mean any delays in enlargement. Kosovo teaches us that we should use every means available to push enlargement ahead as quickly as possible. I believe it is our political responsibility to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">You will have to prepare the Cologne summit. This concerns the intergovernmental conference. We eagerly wait to see what kind of mandate is defined and in what way the European Parliament will be involved in that intergovernmental conference. We would like to be involved in the same way as the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, it would have been a good step in that direction if the President of the European Parliament had also taken part in today"s informal summit. He was not invited!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I also think it would be a good idea to make use of the possibilities offered by the Amsterdam Treaty in relation to justice and home affairs. In the light of Kosovo, we should move rapidly towards the possibility of majority decisions on questions of asylum and immigration policy. That could be achieved by a simple Council decision and it should be done in order to create a genuine ability to act in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is right for the Cologne summit to attach great importance to employment policy. But we should ensure that the discussions are substantive. We should make it clear who really can actively pursue employment policy in Europe. If an employment pact is concluded that has no real substance but that gives the impression that Europe can resolve this problem, and if it then turns out that it cannot resolve the problem because it does not have the necessary instruments, that will damage Europe. European employment policy must not be used as an alibi for the failure of national employment policies! We will put great emphasis on that when we evaluate the Cologne summit.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, today you will meet the newly nominated President, Mr Romano Prodi. We hope that you will confirm what you said earlier, that we need a strong European Commission. Of course there should be a new administrative and new political culture, but we need a strong Commission. I would like to thank President Santer, despite all the difficulties we have had, for what he has done in the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also needs to be fully involved, in the coming period. We have certain queries about the intermediate period. It cannot be that the Council takes three months, while Parliament only has two or three days to play its part in the nomination of the President.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agenda 2000 package has, as you have indicated, been agreed under extraordinarily difficult circumstances: bombardments by NATO as a result of the crisis in Kosovo, resignation of the Commission. We welcome the fact that you have kept the European Union together in a very difficult phase. The alternative would have been the hopelessness and helplessness of the European Union. That is not an acceptable alternative. But at the same time, we know that the price of the package which has been agreed has been very high. We have seen the presence of eleven individual Member States of the European Union rather than the presence of the European Union as a whole. That price has been an unacceptable reduction of the financial margins in areas which are essential for the innovation and renewal of the European Union. As Mr Prodi said here yesterday, we need a start in a new direction. The financial basis for the European Union to do so has been significantly eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, the European Parliament wants an interinstitutional agreement, but not at any price. In this respect I would like to underline that Parliament, in the last few years, has been a very efficient and useful partner. But you need to understand that it is essential that we achieve flexibility in the margins for the future. It is against that background that I make a personal appeal to you, Mr President, to seek some elements of innovation so that we have flexibility and some margins. Otherwise, Parliament will remain a rubber stamp, in budgetary terms, for the next seven years. Let me give you two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">One is what you said about Kosovo. Yes, indeed, Parliament's Committee on Budgets agreed yesterday on the EUR 250m. At the same time it means that we have exhausted the total margin that you decided in Berlin for external affairs. This shows, therefore, that the financial structure of the Union is still not right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that background that we would like to move in the direction of a draft budget which gives the Commission the opportunity to move towards more positive financial gains. I hope that you will find room for more flexibility than is the case at the present time.</p>

As regards Agenda 2000, in spite of the agreement reached in the early hours of 26 March, the image portrayed by the Heads of State and Government was one of confrontation and a lack of vision for the future. In Berlin, each of them stubbornly defended their own interests, but no one furthered the common interest of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has still not provided the resources needed. We cannot consider major objectives with a budget that, in the best case scenario, will only represent 1.27 % of the Community gross domestic product. If the budget is not increased, we cannot coordinate economic policies, stimulate job creation or strengthen solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are disappointed with some of the Berlin conclusions. The allocations for structural policies and for internal policies break with the upwards trend that began in 1988 and that was reinforced in 1993. In addition, the resources needed for the enlargement of the European Union are not guaranteed, and enlargement is now in danger of being postponed. In quantitative terms, the EUR 240 000 million proposed in Agenda 2000 for structural policies has been reduced to EUR 213 000. There is also a gradual decrease in the percentage of GDP set aside for cohesion policies, from 0.46 % at the moment to 0.42 % in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the common agricultural policy is concerned, the compromise reached in Berlin continues with the 1992 reform. One of the consequences of this reform was the disappearance of many farms and the subsequent loss of jobs. Corrective mechanisms should have been introduced in Berlin but this did not happen. We are especially concerned for small family farms, as the fall in prices, which is only partially compensated for by income aid, will mainly affect small and medium‐sized farms. We are also very disappointed that a fair modulation system to provide greater benefits for small producers was not adopted. This could have helped rectify the current situation, where 80 % of aid goes to 20 % of the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the institutional crisis, we welcome the rapid nomination of Mr Romano Prodi as a candidate for President of the Commission, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty. However, we note that there was no dialogue or agreement with the European Parliament on establishing a timetable of investiture for the new Commission, which would allow us, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this temporary situation and, at the same time, strengthen the democratic legitimacy of this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the war in the Balkans, which we will discuss later, I should like to point out, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, that the 15 Member States only approved the NATO military intervention in Yugoslavia once it had already begun. It is clear that the underlying reasons for NATO"s intervention are the Milosevic Government"s constant suppression of the Kosovar Albanian population, after having taken away Kosovo"s autonomy, its disregard for human rights and its refusal to commit to an agreement in Rambouillet. But this harsh and sustained military intervention, which has no mandate from the United Nations, sets a disturbing precedent for the biased use of discretion in international law. Moreover, this military action is now having the opposite effect to its stated objectives: the Serb people are showing greater support for Milosevic as a reaction to the NATO bombings and to the innocent civilian victims it leaves in its wake. The bombings are destroying the country"s infrastructures and, at the same time, having a negative effect on the situation of the Kosovar Albanians, who are being expelled from their country in an unprecedented example of ethnic cleansing. There is also the serious problem of relations with the Russian Federation becoming increasingly tense and the danger of widespread destabilisation in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, I regret that I have to end this speech, but I would like to conclude by stating that it is very unfortunate that the European Union and its institutions have become subordinate to the decisions of a military organisation and relinquished their political responsibility in Europe for so many years. If we do not wish to have to act this way in the future, we must try to prevent such situations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I want to offer my warmest welcome to Chancellor Schroeder who is here on behalf of the German presidency. I thank him very sincerely for what I consider to be one of the finest statements I have heard in Parliament from a President‐in‐Office for a considerable period of time. I thank him for what he said in relation to the crisis in Kosovo. Parliament, by its applause, has shown its satisfaction with that statement. I would also sincerely thank him for the Berlin Resolution in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the President‐in‐Office is having a meeting this afternoon with Heads of State and Government and it is important that during this discussion he convey to his colleagues that it is of the utmost urgency that the relief effort to help Kosovar Albanians continues and that the European Union play a leading role in the humanitarian aid mission. Financial resources must be made available to ensure that the relief programmes continue and that appropriate medicinal and food supplies reach the refugees in need.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have hoped that as this millennium ends we would have left the spectre of war in Europe behind us. Sadly, the totalitarian despot, Mr Milosevic, is fuelling the flames of genocide and compounding the misery of the Kosovar Albanians. I very much hold the view that there should be no escape for Mr Milosevic and that at some stage he must face the charges of war crimes in a court of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one negative point to say to Chancellor Schroeder. I believe that you are genuine in your expression of appreciation of the role of the European Parliament. But your credibility is somewhat questioned by the fact that our President, Mr Gil‐Robles, is not invited to the meeting this afternoon. I regret that. It is a mistake that has happened somewhere along the line and even at this late stage I feel you should reconsider it. It is a bad mistake and gives a wrong signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a special word of thanks and appreciation to Mr Santer for the magnificent work he has done for the European Union for the last four‐and‐a‐half years. I thank him very sincerely for what he has contributed, and also his colleagues in the Commission. I very much regret that he is the victim of circumstances at this particular time. You have my full respect, President Santer, and my appreciation for what you have done for Europe during your term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin Summit of 25 March was a good summit. It achieved a lot in terms of finalising the overall financial parameters for spending within the EU for the seven‐year period after 1999. Ever since the Agenda 2000 proposals for reform of the Union policies were first published in March 1998 it was always felt in some quarters that it would be difficult to find an agreement that was balanced and even‐handed across all the territories of the European Union. The German presidency can take solace from the fact that the spending parameters for the budget for the Union for the period 2000‐2006 commands the confidence and the good will of all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget totals of £506bn will put in place various programmes to lay the foundation for the impending enlargement of the European Union itself. Equally, it will ensure that the common agricultural policy will be properly financed and that many social and regional aid schemes will continue for the poorer Member States of the Union after 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment. It was suggested in a document entitled ‘The future financing of the European Union", issued by the Commission before Christmas, that possibly 25 % of the CAP should be financed by the national exchequers of individual Member States. This would have been a regressive step for the European Union to have taken. It would have been a very divisive move because one of the successful aspects of the CAP is the fact that it is administered in a uniform manner across all the territories of the European Union. Renationalising part of the CAP could only have led to the ultimate disintegration and fragmentation of the common agricultural policy itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to Chancellor Schroeder: you got off to a reasonably weak start in your presidency; you have made tremendous progress in recent times. There are still a lot of important items on the agenda for completion by the end of your presidency. I congratulate you on the progress you are making to date. You are two‐thirds of the way to the winning post. We want to see you put in greater effort between now and the end of June.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Müller </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in Office of the Council, the war in Kosovo puts everything that is happening in Europe, including the Berlin summit, in relative terms. Suddenly every peaceful compromise is worth more than was originally assumed. But every peaceful compromise is only worth what it brings us in terms of security in the next seven years of the reform and enlargement of the European Union. From that point of view, the Berlin summit with all its decisions was a total success. I would like to make three comments from a budgetary point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">One: the financial package is to be welcomed because you managed to reserve the appropriations for the applicant countries on a definitive basis. My group was particularly concerned about that. The EU of 15 has cut back, especially in the structural field, which meant that Berlin sent out a clear and reliable signal to the applicants for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Two: I criticise the financial package because in my view it unfortunately failed to take the decisive step towards redirecting agricultural policy. This is a heavy burden and calls for a review earlier than planned. The Franco‐German engine simply does not run on milk. We all know that. After the elections and under the new Commission, this subject must undoubtedly come back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: from Parliament"s point of view the financial package is not acceptable where it relates to internal and external policy, to administrative expenditure and to the flexibility we want to see. The terrible events in Kosovo show us that foreign policy tasks in particular will increase over the next few years, that we need more than fine words here if we are to organise a genuine common foreign and security policy initiative in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am assuming that we will be able to use the margin for manoeuvre that is still available during the trilogue, and I ask you to support us here. At the same time I join Mr Collins in asking you to reconsider your decision, so that Mr Gil‐Robles can after all take part in the special meeting this afternoon as representative of the European Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lalumière </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, the extraordinary summit in Berlin was, in fact, extraordinary in more than one respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit took place with the dreadful tragedy of Kosovo as a backdrop. It followed on from the first political crisis in the European Union with the Commission"s resignation. It also had to take decisions on Agenda 2000"s major guidelines, particularly the budget guidelines, for the beginning of the new millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">You succeeded, Chancellor, in obtaining results on all the points you had to address. What is more, Germany was able to look above and beyond its own interests and surpassed itself in playing its role as president of the whole Union. Being firm believers in Europe, we sincerely thank you for this. It is good for Germany"s image and good for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the final compromise is not completely satisfactory. As regards budgetary issues, we are still concerned about the capping of resources as, with enlargement and the aid to Kosovo, expenditure is bound to increase. We would at least have liked to have seen the introduction of an automatic review clause for the financial perspectives on the occasion of each enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the common agricultural policy, we fear that the timid compromise that was eventually adopted barely equips us to face the future WTO negotiations. As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, it would have been better if the Union"s measures on economic and social cohesion had been more in line with the Commission"s more generous proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite these reservations, we are, in fact, pleased that the Berlin summit was able to make progress on the main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">You acted very quickly in terms of nominating the President of the Commission. We hope that the rest of the process will be carried out in an efficient manner and without rushing; the main concern must be to rapidly provide the European Union with a new, reformed Commission that can play a true political role.</p>
<p class="contents">This leaves Kosovo, the most important issue. The Berlin summit obviously could not resolve this tragedy, but what was said in Berlin, and what you have just said this morning, is along the right lines. I am thinking here, in particular, of the political role that Russia could, and should, play. I am thinking of the fact that you have called on our countries to immediately take in displaced people and refugees, albeit on a temporary basis. I am also thinking of the idea of some form of stability pact for the Balkans to help relieve the people of their misery and their isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">Your idea is a good one. And when you tell us that Europe should speak with a louder voice and that Europe must respect the values that form the cornerstone of European integration, Mr President‐in‐Office, we can but approve your ideas and hope that everyone will listen to you.</p>

The Council is now saying that the Commission can both be and not be at the same time. The Europe of Nations Group and the June Movement demand that the Commission should actually resign and be replaced by a clean‐up team, which can carry out a clear‐out and clean‐up operation before a new Commission is selected. We urge the national parliaments themselves to select the person who is to represent their country in the European Commission. It should not be Prodi or a majority in this Chamber that decides who should be the Danish member within the Commission. The Danish member should not be the EU's agent with regard to the Danes, but the Danish electorate's representative in the EU, and besides: 1 000 committees, 10 000 different laws and 100 000 projects are far too much to be controlled from Brussels. Cut away the fat! Put the EU on a diet, and give greater freedom to democracy in our countries!</p>

May we just point out that had NATO strategists studied the odd history book over the last ten years they would have discovered that ethnic cleansing is habitual practice for some populations in the Balkans, to which 350 thousand Italians fell victim fifty‐five years ago when they were expelled at gunpoint from the Adriatic coast where they had always lived.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 might have seemed a catalogue of pipe dreams when it made its appearance on the European stage, even though it was tough in tackling the thorniest problems facing the Community. Now that it has been rewritten by the heads of government in Berlin, it looks to us more like a catalogue of disappointments, as it is marked by so many uncertainties and contradictions, reflecting even more than before the uncertainties and contradictions of individual States, which, led for the most part by left‐wing governments, have transferred into Agenda 2000 their now painfully obvious lack of ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts to strike a balance on the agriculture front produced a series of settlements reminiscent of a collection for charity which, once again, penalise a massive sector of the agricultural economy in the south of Europe. Agenda 2000 lacks the courage to tackle the pressing problem of unemployment with decisive measures, given the continued failure to appreciate properly the importance of small and medium‐sized enterprises as well as the acute problem of the entire European Union"s technological backwardness compared to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Agenda 2000 does not put forward an enlightened and strategically valid vision of enlargement is shown, <span class="italic">a posteriori, </span> by the failure of the European Union itself to come up with a foreign policy on the Balkans region, whose history and future are wholly European, leaving aside the madness of the Communist – I repeat, Communist – Milosevic. And the lack of ideas on the part of the mainly left‐wing governments in Europe is proven by the fact that their leaders, meeting in Milan recently, decided to take up Clinton"s proposals on jobs and the economy, thereby demonstrating a worrying degree of scientific, ideological and cultural subservience. If we continue down this road, the day will come when the news will arrive from the United States that a fellow called Christopher Columbus, having left the Hudson Bay with three caravels, has discovered Europe.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: MRS HOFF<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, I should first like to congratulate the President‐in‐Office for the tremendous work carried out at the Berlin summit. In my previous speeches, I said to the President‐in‐Office that he had a difficult task, but the German Presidency has truly shown its mettle and demonstrated its ability to see this task through to the end. In doing so, however, it is natural that Parliament should have some reservations about the content of the budget agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a considerable reduction in the resources available from the European Community. I realise that this was one of the objectives of the German Presidency, but it conflicts with the European Parliament"s objectives. And as the President of the Commission pointed out, it is clear that a new interinstitutional agreement will be needed as the Berlin agreements are developed, an agreement that takes account of Parliament"s opinions. These opinions refer to certain aspects that have been pointed out, for example, the flexibility we need. What will happen when a crisis develops that calls for additional budgetary resources, such as the crisis that has recently unfolded in Kosovo?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a significant reduction of the chapters that can be used in the fight against unemployment. There are also reductions in internal policies, external actions and the Community"s own administration. If we work on the premise that there is currently a shortfall in the Community administration, precisely because the Commission was not given the resources it needed, we must ask ourselves if the resources now available for administration are sufficient to allow the Commission to function.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are also other sectors; specifically, there is no provision for a review clause relating to enlargement. We are aware that the Central and Eastern European countries have enormous needs, and we must think about whether or not we can cover these needs with our current resources. Indeed, I believe that we will need additional resources for enlargement if we wish it to be completed before the end of the new financial perspective, that is to say, before 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural field, we have not yet concluded a far‐reaching reform that will help us to maintain the competitiveness of our agriculture and allow us to improve the quality of life in rural areas. Nor will it be possible to complete such a reform as it does not address the fact that those who live in the countryside are still ranked as second class citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps the area where the biggest cuts have been made is that of structural policies. The Commission – and Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies is here now – had made very strict provision for structural policies. These policies have been reduced on the basis of criteria that can perhaps be explained but that will make it more difficult to pursue cohesion policies within the European Union. In other words, there are a range of regions and countries which have a lower level of development, which have to compete under very difficult conditions to meet the objectives of the stability pact and which will experience problems doing so. One amendment that could be very damaging is the plan to do away with the exemption for outermost regions from the 75 % requirement for Objective 1 status. If this exemption disappears, the outermost regions will presumably be treated in the same way as mainland regions, irrespective of the enormous difficulties they face.</p>
<p class="contents">On a different matter, Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to thank the German Presidency, the Council, and the governments of the Member States for the decisive action they have taken on the Kosovo crisis. We are applying new international humanitarian law, international humanitarian law that was born in 1945 with the United Nations Charter and with the Nuremberg trials. We clearly cannot allow a Head of State and Government to inflict suffering on a population like the suffering Mr Milosevic is forcing upon a section of the Yugoslav population, the Kosovar Albanians.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, at the moment, the Member States of the European Union are acting as representatives of the whole of humanity, within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. And we in the European Parliament, or at least in the Socialist Group, support such measures and hope that they can bring about a prompt solution to the problem, perhaps by means of an initiative similar to the one recently taken by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations. This solution should mean the withdrawal of Milosevic"s troops from Kosovo, the Kosovar population should be allowed to return to the area under international protection and, eventually, reconstruction and economic recovery should begin in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there is little time left for the German Presidency, but the European Parliament hopes that the presidency will continue to support NATO"s peacemaking efforts and support the Kosovar Albanian population.</p>

This had to be done with the prospect of an enlarged Europe on the horizon and in an extremely unsettled global context.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of the European Union could have been broken by a barrier of national interests. Failure would have spelt political disaster only three months after the launch of the euro and two months before the European elections. But, above all, it would have spelt disaster had it occurred in the midst of the Kosovo tragedy. There will only be a positive outcome to this tragedy if there are no rifts in the solidarity uniting the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We now see that the Community"s main interest won through. As you said, Europe was able to speak with a single voice. Europe demonstrated its ability to take action, the essential elements have been preserved and we must congratulate you on this. This is important as the strength of the Union resides in its ability to unite to manage the overall balances needed to make the market function, since the aims of the market are not purely economic ones but also social and even humanist ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I chaired our negotiating delegation with the Council on the Structural Funds, I should like to speak on that specific point this morning. Throughout our meetings, we appreciated Minister Verheugen"s frankness, warmth and ability to listen. Today, we feel that, on the whole, our opinions were listened to. The Berlin agreement incorporates part of the guidelines that Parliament held dear and we support the three main themes adopted by the Council in this field: concentration, simplification and effectiveness. However, there are a number of issues that have not been fully resolved. My colleagues, Mr Arias Cañete, our rapporteurs and, earlier on, Mr Medina Ortega, spoke on these issues. We must continue the dialogue with the Council so that together we can successfully resolve these issues before the end of the present parliamentary term. However, to achieve this, the negotiations on the financial perspective and on the new interinstitutional agreement must lead to compromises that Parliament can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured, Mr President‐in‐Office, that the European Parliament will be flexible, but it also expects the Council to fully recognise the democratic role played by our institution. That is why we are in favour of the plan to allow the President of the European Parliament to attend the informal Council meeting that will take place this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government were able to make a unanimous decision to nominate Mr Prodi as President of the new Commission and, I hope, are awaiting Parliament"s approval. I have no doubt that this will be an important factor in the success of this reform, which is essential for the success of the Union, a Union that views enlargement as an absolute political necessity.</p>

And we can appreciate that the Chancellor is very pleased with the outcome of the Berlin summit. Agreements were reached there on some difficult and sensitive issues. The substance of those agreements, regrettably, does not match up to the high‐flown rhetoric which the Council President employs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just one example. The Council President tells us that it has been decided to release a sum of EUR 150 million for the refugees from Kosovo. We welcome that. But how starkly that contrasts with conclusion 45 of the Berlin summit, which is that under the heading ‘Particular situations (2000‐2006)', EUR 5 200 million and more are to be dished out to the Member States themselves to cover events of this kind. More than EUR 5 200 million for the governments to distribute to their people, whilst a mere 150 million are available for the refugees, when the Council was unable last week to agree a unanimous position on how to accept refugees, and when in the financial perspective the amount of appropriations for the emergency aid reserve has been cut to virtually nothing for the whole of the period 2000‐2006. The harsh reality of the mathematical exercises in Berlin gives the lie to the fine words spoken there. Discrepancies of this kind are likely to make Europe"s people lose all faith in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the European Commission and its president‐designate, my group likewise believes that the Council has not fully discharged its responsibilities. We welcome the agreement to designate Romano Prodi as president‐in‐waiting. But we also note that the Council, by not making any changes to the membership of the Commission, is placing Parliament before a major dilemma. We cannot agree to Mrs Cresson continuing to serve as a Commissioner. My group will not work with her, and we advise her not to show her face here again.

Any other interpretation would, after all, lead to constitutional difficulties. I should be glad to know if the Council shares this view.</p>

As the air strikes are only making matters worse, we must pull out all the stops to find a political solution that, alone, is capable of bringing an end to the atrocities of the Milosevic regime and to the suffering of the Kosovar people, and that will also combat nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Berlin conclusions, you mentioned, Chancellor, that the Berlin Council had reached a good compromise. My feelings are slightly more mixed. Even though it allowed us to make some progress, the agreement contains some shortfalls and presents risks for the future. Of course, the harshest options were rejected, but nothing has been settled for the future. Consequently, in agricultural matters, the price reductions were not as severe as the Commission had requested, but they are nonetheless significant and, more importantly, they are only partially compensated for. These cuts will have a negative impact on agricultural incomes, particularly for small and medium‐sized farmers as the idea of putting a ceiling on assistance has been rejected. What is more, the agreement does not put us in the best position to resist American pressure in the next round of WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the principle of financial solidarity has been retained and that the idea of cofinancing has been rejected. I am also delighted that we are moving towards a fairer financing system. However, in spite of some options put forward, by the Commission in particular, the Council has avoided the issue of seeking new own resources. Why not introduce taxation on financial transactions? This would guarantee greater justice since those who benefit most from the single market would also help finance European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to conclude, I welcome the positive political signals from the Council on South Africa and Palestine.</p>

In place of the Europe of our dreams, we now have a protectorate of the United States. This is the harsh, unpleasant and galling truth.</p>
<p class="contents">He said that there were three main issues of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the crisis in the Commission, the selection of Mr Prodi as its President is a very positive step. However, Mr Prodi must understand that he cannot be President of the Commission and, at the same time, a party leader in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Chancellor, Agenda 2000 will sink without trace before it sets off on its maiden voyage if its budget remains frozen at 1.27 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we cannot enlarge the European family, combat unemployment, and implement a policy for growth through words alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I was surprised to hear you say, with reference to Kosovo, that European civilisation has made it necessary to bomb Yugoslavia. Do you really believe that you are bombing Mr Milosevic, at whose door lie so many mistakes? Unfortunately, Mr Milosevic has gained strength because of the bombing. However, churches, cemeteries, civilian trains and hospitals are being bombed, and these attacks have absolutely nothing to do with European civilisation and history.</p>

But this time things still went well. The summit did not produce a reform but at least it produced a package which will allow the Union to get through the next few years. The summit did in fact produce one important signal for the future of Europe. It fixed a binding, early date for enlargement. That sent out a necessary signal to the applicant countries and their people. It spurred them on in their reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace is an expensive asset. That is why I can only repeat that Europe"s future lies in overcoming attempts to draw new frontiers and the domination of national interests. But at the same time the Berlin summit drew up a timetable for institutional reform, so that the Union can become capable of enlargement in the first place. I hope the Council will then recognise that Parliament has equal rights and finally accord it more powers and the right of initiative. That is the precondition for overcoming the blockage of unanimous decisions. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, just imagine if you had to hand out 20 or 25 presents to ensure that everyone agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">More rights for Parliament means closeness to the people and democracy for the European Union. That is the future: a Europe that is all of a piece, that is social, ecological and democratic. That is what we want and that is what we must achieve!</p>

<p class="contents">The agreement reached by the European Council is the result of negotiations that concentrated on the defence of national interests rather than on the defence of the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Our government advocated a speculative, short‐term policy in Berlin and this House must now make all efforts to change this approach and return to a more pro‐European one.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of the Berlin summit will not help us meet the challenges we now have to face. Enlargement of the Union, reform of the institutions and cohesion and solidarity policies will remain mere ideas unless they are backed up by an appropriate budgetary policy and federalist spirit. This spirit is what has allowed the European Union to progress in the past but it was completely lacking in Berlin.</p>

<p class="contents">In truth, this is a superficial compromise, which probably only hopes to survive the European elections without any hitches, and to wait until the real problems emerge in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, the plan to maintain the overall levels of allocations and cohesion expenditure will undoubtedly soon lead to a sharp drop in the share awarded to countries such as France. This will become apparent when the details of how this works in practice come to light. Similarly, maintaining the appropriations for agriculture is a purely aesthetic step, as this will only be achieved if the EAGGF‐Guidance Section is transferred to the agricultural guideline. In reality, other expenditure will decrease sharply in the context of a reduction in the Community preference system.</p>
<p class="contents">These guidelines have not yet been clearly understood by the public nor, indeed, by many French national elected representatives. Yet they are not even enough to guarantee a sustainable balance in terms of the financial perspective. Moreover, only earlier today, the President of the Commission was already calling for additional administrative appropriations. The Council is so aware of this that, in its conclusions, it calls on the Commission to undertake a general review of the own resources system and to include the question of creating new autonomous own resources. In other words, if we are being frank, the Council is talking of creating European taxes. It seems clear that the European Union is preparing to fill the holes by creating new compulsory levies.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be most interested to know whether the French Liberals approve of the Berlin conclusions in this respect.</p>

Against the background of the Kosovo conflict, every other policy area simply becomes relatively less urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">On Agenda 2000: expenditure was stabilised in the structural field, although this meant fairly major shifts in the definition of financial priorities within the structural measures, such as the increase of cohesion resources by as much as EUR 3 billion. At any rate, for the new Objective 2, which is intended among other things to promote rural development, the support has been cut by 5 %. I cannot help thinking that the support could have been concentrated on the neediest regions, considering that more than EUR 4 bn of financial treats were distributed all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Berlin conclusions do represent a response to the further financing of the existing Community of 15 and of an enlarged Europe. On the one hand the Council calls on the Commission to take energetic action to create new, autonomous own resources. Elsewhere it equally clearly lays down that the financial perspective needs to be adjusted, incidentally by a qualified Council majority. That also explains the statements by your colleague Mr Wemheuer and by President Santer of the Commission, who both said that the current agreement would soon have be followed by another reform. So I do not share the view of some Members of this House that the adoption of Agenda 2000 really is a great success.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Members of the Commission, a war is going on in Kosovo and between NATO and Yugoslavia. Whatever our view of its legality, it is a fact. War is not normally the time for taking a nuanced view, for heightened sensibilities, for a sensible mixture of reason and emotion. Yet that is what we must do today, for even in times of war we must not only think of peace but also work to achieve it. In that sense I welcome what you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, said here, because you have expressed that same feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">Military action became necessary. I am not happy about it, many of us are not happy about it, but we would be even less happy if we had to watch the massacres continue without trying to put a stop to them. Many of us would have preferred to see this action take place under the umbrella of the United Nations. But unfortunately the attitude of Russia and China prevented that. Yet I want to state clearly on behalf of my group: we still believe that on principle such actions must be carried out by the United Nations and we must do all we can to reform the United Nations in such a way as to make that possible in future. But that also means that as you said, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, sovereignty must give way to the principle of respect for human rights. We know that sovereignty has been an important objective over the course of history. But our experience in Europe has shown us that there are higher values than total and absolute respect for national sovereignty. We must get that message across.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, the military action has clear humanitarian objectives and we very strongly urge you to adhere to those objectives. It is not a people that we want to defeat, it is the regime, it is Milosevic and his bands of soldiers, as Mr Hänsch called them. Unfortunately – and that is an inevitable consequence – at the moment the situation is that the Serbs have closed ranks even more. Even the opposition, the few who were opposed, and above all the intellectual opposition and the critics in Serbia, do not understand NATO"s action and are actually rallying round Milosevic. We must do all in our power to make it clear that we are differentiating between a regime that has brought disaster upon its own people, and a people we want to have in Europe like all the other peoples of this continent and all the other peoples of the Balkans. We must do our utmost to ensure that there are as few civilian victims as possible in the wake of the military actions. That has to be our aim, and not just for reasons of humanity but precisely in order to differentiate between the regime and the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been done for the refugees. Perhaps some of it was done rather too late, but there is no sense in lamenting that now. We will have to do all we can to help the refugees and to support the great, indeed the immense willingness of the people of Europe and of many non‐governmental organisations to provide aid. We may say that people today are hard‐hearted, but Kosovo and the reaction of the people in Europe show that many also have a very soft, humanitarian heart, and we have to turn that to good use. I am especially grateful to Mrs Bonino for her very vigorous support here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say quite plainly that first and foremost we should provide assistance <span class="italic">in situ</span> . We must not grant Milosevic the great victory of finally emptying Kosovo of all Albanians and preventing the Albanian inhabitants who are scattered throughout Europe from returning home again. We must prevent him from achieving that aim, but above all we must also help the neighbouring countries who are doing outstanding work in a situation that is not easy, for the situation is not easy for Albania, or for Macedonia or for Rome. We must help them to pursue a humanitarian refugee policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council: you clearly pointed the way into the future, whether in the form of a Balkan conference or whatever we call it. We must begin with a kind of Marshall Plan or stability pact. That costs money. But the war and the crises and unrest cost more money and above all they also cost many human lives. You also said that we must contrast the 21st century with the 19th century. I agree with you. The 19th century was a century in which not only did the Balkan peoples come to grief over their nationalism, it was a century when the European powers exploited the Balkan peoples in order to assert their own interests. Now it is not a question of playing off one Balkan country, i.e. the people of one country, against another one. What we must do is bring the people closer together, laboriously bring them together and also show them that it is possible to coexist, as we do in western Europe despite the wars we have had. Even if many people say that the Kosovar Albanians will never be able to coexist with the Serbs – they must coexist, they must coexist on the same continent, in the same region, and it is up to Europe to learn from its own mistakes in the past, to make up for its own past mistakes and lead the people of the Balkans into a peaceful, a non‐nationalistic Europe.</p>

The plight of the Kosovar Albanians finally sunk in last year. Finally, every political means was applied, but they had no prospect of succeeding against the Belgrade butcher. Bosnia could have taught us that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do understand, however, that democracies are finding it hard to use military force, since they were not constantly updated on Milosevic"s reign of terror in Kosovo. Milosevic has no interest whatsoever in the people living in his own country. He has no respect for mankind! That is shown by the mass graves in Croatia and Bosnia. It is shown by the deportations in Kosovo, by the countless acts of rape and the cruel murder of many Albanians. Over all the years of the apartheid regime, Milosevic"s governors had already committed countless murders and acts of torture. I myself found evidence of many of these atrocities in Kosovo between 1991 and 1998 and repeatedly denounced them, at a time when all the western politicians were simply looking the other way.</p>
<p class="contents">Milosevic does not care about the welfare of his Serbian citizens either, who have been the economic and psychological victims of his policy for many years. Unfortunately, however, the bomb attacks on Serbia have led a good number of Serbian citizens to mistakenly rally round Milosevic. Milosevic has always used nationalism as a means of maintaining himself in power. But nationalism dumbs people down and leads them astray, as we have seen on several occasions during this century.</p>
<p class="contents">Milosevic did not in fact set in motion his devilish machinery to wipe out a whole people at the moment when NATO started bombing. Unfortunately these bombing raids were the only logical response to his atrocities. Continued inaction would have made the west more guilty before history than this targeted bombing which, we hope, has a definite political aim. But the political solution must on no account be the partition of Kosovo. If we accepted that we would ourselves be creating a potential flashpoint there for the next hundred years. Since 1990 I have been trying in vain here to make the Council and the Commission aware of Milosevic"s planned strategy. The <span class="italic">sanu memorandum</span> of 1985 drawn up by the Serbian Academy of Sciences spells out that strategy. It also states that Kosovo will be partitioned if he cannot be contained, a partition into the wealthy north with its rich mineral resources, what is known as ‘the cradle of the Serbians", and the poor south, whose existence would sooner or later destroy the state of Macedonia and thus create serious difficulties throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the only solution at this point is an autonomous Kosovo, in which the citizens are returned home under the protection of international troops. The further political future of Kosovo depends very much on a change in the Belgrade regime and the democratisation of Serbia. The leading figures round Milosevic and Milosevic himself must also be brought before the Hague tribunal. On behalf of my group I support all the diplomatic efforts made by the presidency of the Council. But there is one other thing I would ask of you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council. I beseech you to make even greater efforts to enable Mr Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov prize‐winner, and his family, to leave the country.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">After abandoning him for years by its pacifist tolerance of the apartheid regime, the west now owes it to him to at least ensure that he and his family receive exit visas. I cordially ask you to do this for humanitarian reasons!</p>

I would like to say something about the Commission and the problems there have been, and about the criticism that has been levelled. I would like to emphasise that the Council itself bears a huge responsibility for the fact that things went so wrong. It is the Council which, time after time, has approved accounts which should not have been approved. It was the Council which, only this March, disregarded Parliament and approved the accounts for 1997, on the very day when the report from the five experts made it clear that the accounts should not have been approved and that Parliament was right. It is incomprehensible that the Council was unwilling to learn from Parliament's persistent criticism, which was so often voiced here in this Chamber by my party colleague, Eva Kjer Hansen, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Council which is now largely responsible for the profoundly obsolete and rigid Staff Regulations. It is the Council which failed to give its backing when Commissioner Liikanen's much‐needed proposals on staff reforms were stopped by obdurate trade unions a year ago. It is the Council which now has the opportunity to insist that these proposals are carried out to the letter, together with the SEM 2000 and MAP 2000 reform plans, which are sorely needed. It is the Council which must now insist on flexibility, delegation, more fixed‐term posts and easier ways to get rid of substandard employees. It is only the Council which can abolish the national and geographic quotas in the recruitment policy, so that in future we can recruit the best candidate in every situation. It is the Council which has buried the Commission in far too many large and small programmes with no way of controlling them. It is the Council which must ensure that the principle of subsidiarity becomes more than just idle talk. It is the Council which must implement cost‐cutting and streamlining measures to facilitate enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, while keeping expenditure under the 1.25 % ceiling. Instead of this, unfortunately, the Council ended up diluting the sorely needed agricultural reforms, on which there had usually been a consensus at ministerial level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, I hope that you take all this along with you to your – hopefully fruitful – meeting this afternoon with the new President of the Commission. In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your resolute stance on the question of Kosovo.</p>

It is a fact that the Berlin Council accepted the constraints imposed by the Stability Pact and did not alter them, and that the resources it approved were an inadequate response to Community policies and to the challenges of cohesion and of future enlargement. The Berlin Council maintained unacceptable exceptions to the own resources system, yet at the same time failed to agree on any penalty for speculative movements of capital. The rejection of agricultural cofinancing cannot blind us to the fact that imbalances and privileges for richer and more powerful countries have been preserved in the CAP. As for regional policy, the overall reduction in the Cohesion Fund will mean a cut of at least 18 billion escudos per annum for Portugal, which is incidentally one of the cohesion countries. And if this reduction leads to more restrictive conditions, structural resources could be even more limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the pompous declarations and triumphs announced in Berlin concerning internal consumption, the lack of solidarity and the indifference towards cohesion confirmed in Berlin will lead to greater stagnation, higher unemployment, and poorer jobs and social welfare in the European Union.</p>

Yet I am still not entirely satisfied with the Berlin conclusions. Agricultural policy is not necessarily your political field, but what you produced in this respect was not a huge success. You said in your statement that a clear signal must be sent out to the markets. That signal is being sent out in the wrong direction. Adherence to intervention signals to the Central and Eastern European states that they should abandon their markets and aim at intervention. That is the wrong direction to take.</p>
<p class="contents">You also spoke, in a different connection, about solidarity with the weak. But there are weak groups in agriculture too, and the absence of a degressive system and the graduated system have done nothing for the smaller farmers; instead the smaller undertakings will now suffer from the price reduction and the fact that they are not fully compensated. I do not want to hear any more from you, the Chancellor, about how efficient the large undertakings are, for it is into the large, rationalised undertakings that EU funds are flowing, which makes it easy for them to operate. The smaller undertakings have adjusted to the market. That is where the real achievement lies, and they should have been supported. I admit that provision is made for this under the second pillar. That is the only glimmer of light in the agricultural field.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on budgetary discipline: to save is not in itself a quality. I hope you agree with me there. There should have been a more definite restructuring here, the kind of modulation of agricultural funding proposed by the Commission. In fact I would like to praise Mr Fischler here. What the Commission proposed would also have sent out a signal to the smaller undertakings, who adjust to the market. That institution must now remain able to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, please urge the intergovernmental conference to include agricultural policy in the codecision procedure. It is urgently necessary for Parliament to obtain the right to specific and substantive codecision powers in this area too.</p>

But it did include the long‐scheduled items on Agenda 2000. It is a good thing that decisions have been taken, at any rate, although it has to be said that the Council is storing up a good deal of trouble for itself. Hence it is a bad thing that reforms in the milk products sector are not to take effect until 2005. This means that the Union will certainly not be ready, in respect of this sector, to allow new Member States to join from Central and Eastern Europe. The Council did, however, manage to agree a thrifty budget covering several years for the immediate future. These financial perspectives offer hopes of an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The speed with which the Council has chosen Mr Prodi as president‐designate of the European Commission has our approval. But it is just the first step. I therefore repeat my insistence, for the benefit of the Council, that the new European Commission must be able to get down to work as quickly as possible and before the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot understand what was said about the Middle East. Mr Arafat"s announced intention to declare a Palestinian state looked more like a means of political pressure than a realistic plan. European support for that Palestinian state could mean the wrong kind of pressure being exerted on the peace talks. What exactly is the intention here with this Palestinian state?</p>
<p class="contents">NATO intervention in Kosovo was and is inevitable. The Dutch Members in my group unreservedly support the EU position on Kosovo.</p>

We were harsh on you because, given the honesty we demanded of your Commission, none of the governments of the 15 Member States should remain in office. As regards the corruption you were accused of, it was probably the quiet Socialist corruption of the 1980s. We saw examples of this in Mr González"s government, Mr Craxi"s government and Mr Mitterrand"s governments, with the exception, perhaps, of the government of our colleague Mr Rocard. We also saw examples of this in Belgium with Mr van den Broek, head of the Socialist Party, who will head the list in Flanders despite the Agusta affair. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Mrs Cresson"s shoes did not cost EUR 2 000. Perhaps your biggest mistake was to take on the legacy of your predecessor, Mr Jacques Delors, in the BSE affair. Mr Delors is a democrat who, throughout his whole political career, has never stood as a candidate in a single election, except in a local election in Clichy.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor, in Berlin, a symbolic town whose name nonetheless makes one shiver and brings to mind certain images, it was decided that for the first time Mr Cohn‐Bendit"s army would return to the scenes where there are still some survivors who remember previous wars. In Serbia, six streets in Belgrade carry the name of French generals from the First and Second World Wars, when the Serbs fought heroically against the Axis powers. This was at a time when there were real deportees and camps that, I believe, were called concentration camps. In Serbia, as in Iraq, Europe is missing its chance to establish an independent foreign policy. If we want to become a major power, with a single currency and a euro that must compete with the dollar, if we want our GDP to rocket, we should sort out the European family affairs in Serbia, in the bosom of the European family, without bringing in a sheriff from outside, and without creating, in particular, as a finishing touch, an Islamic crescent that encompasses Kosovo, Albania, and perhaps Bosnia. In Berlin, Mr Prodi was nominated: he is the leader of the Olive Tree Coalition and it is somewhat ironic to think of the olive tree at a time when we are starting a war. Mr Schröder, you combine German traits with British humour.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, we also discussed technical issues in Berlin. We first discussed the CAP and reached a modest little compromise, especially at France"s expense. Expenditure is being frozen and prices cut by 20 % instead of 30 % for meat, and by 15 % instead of 20 % for cereals. These reductions are only compensated for in part and, above all, we are preparing to fall into line with the United States in the world trade negotiations, as we did in 1992. Europe is a continent for those who fall into line and it is only natural that we should bomb Yugoslavia, a country which symbolises non‐alignment. Germany also lost out over the Structural Funds...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Exclamations from various quarters) </span></p>
<p class="contents">There was also financial arbitration in Berlin. Mr Schröder, you are too well briefed not to know that we will be forced to create a European tax ...</p>

<p class="contents">Madam President, I have been constantly interrupted.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be forced to create a European income tax or corporation tax unless the Greens force us to adopt a tax on CO<span class="sub">2</span> , due to all the pollution caused by bombing refineries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Myller </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Madam President, in the appalling human catastrophe that is Kosovo, and especially with the refugee situation as desperate as it is, the European Union must be able to relieve the situation of the refugees, or rather those who have been driven out of their country. Furthermore, when other options fail relocation of the refugees outside the region and within the EU area must be an option on humanitarian grounds. The EU must adopt a position where it can actively encourage the start of talks for a just peace settlement, and we must also try to involve Russia in the negotiations. Everything that can be done must be done to alleviate this human suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraordinary European Council at Berlin was held, at least to some extent, in very special circumstances. The Community lacked clear leadership as a result of the resignation of the Commission the previous month. The Member States, and above all Germany as the holder of the presidency, are to be congratulated on getting decisions through at Berlin, despite the difficulties. This is because there was real effort to reach decisions: nothing was left to chance. The basic attitude was that the talks should be conducted well, before any solutions were found.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many of us have problems in approving the substance of Agenda 2000, or at least we have comments to make. The agricultural solution that pleased many Member States has simply swept serious problems under the carpet. In any case, it has to be said, especially as far as agriculture is concerned, that new solutions still need to be found before enlargement takes place, and the WTO talks are not succeeding either, with the present brief. One thing we welcome in the agricultural solution is the better integration of issues relating to the environment, and in that regard the Commission was very successful in laying the groundwork for further action. Good too was the fact that at long last agricultural conditions in the Nordic countries were taken into account to a reasonable extent, and that at least some success was achieved in limiting the seemingly unstoppable flow of money spent on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we fared better, in broad terms, on regional and structural policy. What is most important is that the scheme should be simplified and made more efficient. Now Parliament has to ensure that the problems which are still on the table are discussed in cooperation so that Parliament can debate the whole of Agenda 2000 as one package in May. This will be a special challenge for the success of enlargement and for the European Union to be able to continue working effectively. If I had to pick out some of the problems with regional and structural policy, one disappointment is obviously the fact that Objective 3, the employment initiative, is lagging behind the others, while we here in Parliament have always maintained that solving the problems of employment is a priority task for the European Union. Now we must focus our attention on highlighting the issue of unemployment in Objectives 2 and 3 to a much greater and more significant extent than is the case now.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable for appointing the Commission must be established without delay, but at the same time we must ensure that we adhere to the objectives Parliament has for reforming it.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the German Presidency luck as it draws to an end. I hope that the developments launched so successfully in Berlin will manage to stay the course. Once more I would like to congratulate everyone on the fact that the Agenda 2000 package was approved at Berlin. This will offer plenty of scope for the future Finnish Presidency to succeed in the face of its immense challenges. The Finnish Government may have already been elected as I speak.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oostlander </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, in the last ten years, Milosevic"s regime has been guilty of large‐scale repression and a series of wars. The latest and worst is the current crisis in Kosovo, but it does not end there. Attempts to destabilise Macedonia and Montenegro are already under way, and Albania has meantime come under fire.</p>
<p class="contents">The expulsion of ethnic minorities and the mass killings in Kosovo show the contempt in which the Milosevic regime holds human values – a contempt which some are emphasising by provocatively toying with a target, something that merely illustrates their disdain for the humanitarian values of the NATO governments, which as we know are seeking to get as many civilian victims as possible out of harm"s way.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot really talk to a regime like that any more. It does not share the values of which the Council President, the Federal Chancellor, spoke just now. This regime needs to be replaced, as a wise Serbian bishop of the orthodox church said here in this building a few months ago: there will never be a solution in Serbia and Kosovo unless Serbia becomes a state governed by the rule of law. If it does, you may be sure that minority rights and human rights will be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, almost a million refugees are wandering around in Kosovo and the adjoining countries. Help is urgently needed, and we therefore agree with the Commission"s policy of giving urgent assistance to Albania and Macedonia. The efforts being made by various Member States are of course laudable and vital, but Parliament would really prefer a policy for the European Union as a whole. Good European Union facilities for accepting refugees as close as possible to their original homes can make it easier to coordinate aid and avoid problems over how the cost should be shared. That will also protect the Union against the futile attitude of financial nitpicking shown by a number of governments in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission certainly needs enough qualified personnel to do all this. We agree with Mr Santer"s call for them. It is right and proper, and our belief, that extra resources should be found for Macedonia, a country of which we have already been asking too much for too long. Political support for Montenegro is also appropriate, since it is inhabited by Serbs who retain a policy of openness towards Europe. We should be mindful of that.</p>

<p class="contents">The success of the Berlin summit is the result of compromise between Member States that allowed us to reform the Union"s common policies. We welcome this, even if, relatively speaking, we are far from achieving the ambitious objective originally declared by Mr Jacques Santer. We have put the Union back on its feet but we have not necessarily given it all the assets it needs to conclude the enlargement negotiations. And we are all aware that there will be other dates to set.</p>
<p class="contents">Your success is due to the fact that you rejected non‐Community measures that would have transformed the European Union into an à la carte free‐for‐all. You have avoided this by rejecting cofinancing. Cofinancing would have sent out a bad signal as it would mean dismantling the Union"s only real integrated policy at the very moment when the enlargement negotiations are underway.</p>
<p class="contents">Your success is also due to the fact that you rejected a system of levelling‐down which would have been at odds with all the mechanisms aimed at ensuring Community solidarity. Perhaps more could have been done as regards the existing measures aimed at ensuring a fair return.</p>
<p class="contents">I will only say one thing about agriculture, and that is that it is unfortunate that the phased reduction of aid was not as well accepted in the agreement. I feel that this would have contributed to more balanced, more equitable agriculture where we provide greater assistance to those in greatest need.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, you mentioned the issue of institutional reform. With the appointment of Mr Prodi, the reforming of the Commission is now under way, and we welcome that. This Commission must practise greater collective responsibility in performing its duties. It cannot operate using feudal systems, baronies and reserved domains.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also coordinate the Union"s external actions. How can we implement a common foreign and security policy when five separate Commissioners are responsible for these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">These are matters of great urgency. But the whole package of institutional reforms is also a matter of great urgency, because the Union is in need of such reforms and because it is a precondition to the next enlargements, as you quite rightly emphasised this morning. We support this.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there is Kosovo. In this crisis, in this war, the Union"s voice must be strong because it is vital in Europe. We all agree on our objective, namely the end of ethnic cleansing. Non‐discrimination is enshrined in our Treaties and in our laws. We must ensure that it is respected within our borders, but also outside them.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it simply, we know that peace will not be obtained at any cost. We have committed our troops. We had to do so. Now we must also work on involving the United Nations and Russia in the search for a solution. We need a protected humanitarian area, complete with intervention forces. We need a conference of the Balkans leading to a European Union of the Balkans and your stability pact must contribute to this. We also need to think about the consequences of a European defence identity and strong proposals to reform the United Nations.</p>

<p class="contents">You had a busy agenda in front of you and you cleared the ground. First of all, you made a start on solving the institutional problem posed by the Commission"s resignation by appointing Mr Prodi. You left the common agricultural policy intact, rather than reforming it. You took significant decisions on the Kosovo crisis and you began work on the financial perspective, outlining choices that, on the whole, we approve.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European Council has done its job and we must thank you for this, Chancellor.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words on the financial perspective, as I believe it poses a problem. In Berlin, the European Council made two choices. It chose rigour, which we approve of, and it rejected flexibility, which worries us. You chose rigour and we understand why, even though such rigour may sometimes be deceptive. For example, as regards agriculture, the overall budget is less than the total specific commitments that were agreed on. Also, category 5 does not allow us to meet the requirements for further staff, which were becoming increasingly apparent, as the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, quite rightly highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">This House accepts that you have opted for budgetary rigour and we have always supported this approach, but above all, and in spite of everything, you rejected flexibility and that is important. Without flexibility, we cannot be rigorous, because if we look at category 4, we see that expenditure on Kosovo will far exceed the amount under this heading.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to take an aggressive stance, we must remember, Chancellor, that Parliament has the legal and institutional resources to re‐establish the margin of flexibility we believe is necessary. And we will do so if, in the next few days, you do not take some steps towards giving us the flexibility that we believe is extremely valuable, as valuable as you believe rigour to be.</p>

Once again in Europe, we are seeing the terrible consequences which fanatical nationalism, racism and fascism can lead to.</p>
<p class="contents">History is repeating itself. Mr President‐in‐Office, the German Presidency commands respect in this difficult period. However, you have to cope with the most important problem in the functioning of the European institutions, namely the unanimity required for making decisions in crucial areas. This applies not only to the common foreign and security policy; it applies also to the foreign ministers, who were actually unable, shamefully, to come up with a humanitarian response last week in the tragic circumstances we are witnessing today.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Berlin summit itself, Mr President‐in‐Office, you deserve praise for unquestionably securing an overall agreement. In some respects, you secured a good agreement. In other respects, we believe it was a bad one. You secured a good agreement concerning Commission President Prodi, who already showed us in the House yesterday that he is made of the right stuff. You secured a bad agreement, in our view, on Europe"s budget. On the one hand as regards revenues: the decision, the compromise on own resources to my mind means giving in to the Member States who have for years argued for the principle of the <span class="italic">juste retour</span> . We have called in Parliament for greater transparency and fewer rebates. We have got less transparency and more rebates. That is most regrettable. Nor have we obtained any satisfaction on the interinstitutional agreement, either in qualitative or quantitative terms. Parliament"s rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, is always a moderate man. He said very sharply last week that the proposals currently on the table for an interinstitutional agreement are a kind of provocation. So I think it will take a great deal of hard work to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, I cannot deny that your statement this morning impressed me greatly. We fully support your resolute approach to the Cologne summit. We hope you will secure a clear timetable there for new institutional ‘deepening", which is vital if Europe is to have credibility. We hope too that you will be successful in achieving a European Employment Pact with which we can persuade people to have renewed faith in the future of Europe. In other words, Cologne has to produce more of substance than Berlin. We are confident that you will work energetically to ensure that it does.</p>

<p class="contents">But our congratulations must also be extended to the whole college of Commissioners for their excellent preparatory work on Agenda 2000 and for their sincere dedication throughout the whole procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of regional policy, the European Parliament has stated quite clearly that the Union should set aside a minimum of 0.46 % of Community GDP for cohesion policies. It must be set at this level if we wish to have sufficient critical mass available to reduce regional disparities at a satisfactory pace, as highlighted in both the triannual report and the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The regrettable debate on net budget balances and excessive contributions to the Community budget has led to substantial financial reductions in the Commission"s proposals for cohesion policies, which were already modest in themselves. This debate ignores the fact that the balanced development of the whole Community territory leads to extremely favourable trade balances for the wealthiest Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is fair to say that, although expenditure is being reduced, the principle of concentration was left intact. By allocating more than two thirds of the Structural Funds to Objective 1 regions, work on cohesion will remain at levels that are the same as or higher than those of the previous programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also welcome the fact that Objective 3 now has a horizontal character and the fact that the Cohesion Fund has been maintained, thereby ending a fruitless and meaningless debate.</p>
<p class="contents">But in this respect, as Mr Bourlanges claimed, we are concerned that we have still to establish the financial perspectives needed to provide a multiannual financial framework for long‐term policies such as regional polices.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council were to show a certain degree of flexibility, this would add the finishing touch to the Berlin agreement and would enable us to conclude the interinstitutional agreement. This agreement is vital if we are to guarantee the stability of Community finances in the coming century.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schröder, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first, of course, thank you very much for your praise of our work. It is a pleasure not just to be criticised for hard work but occasionally – in this Parliament at least – also to hear words of praise.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally I shall begin by responding to the critical comments that have been made. And I am happy to do so. But let me say at the outset that I am pleased there has been agreement on the Kosovo issue here in Parliament, barring a very few critical voices. I have taken careful note of Parliament"s strong reactions to the human rights violations in Kosovo and of its resolute support – or at least the support of a very large majority of Members – for the western position.</p>
<p class="contents">In evaluating the situation, let me go back to what one Member of your Parliament, Mrs Pack, had to say. In my view she gave a very accurate analysis and accurate description of the risks that could arise if the international community does not continue to take resolute action with a view to reaching a political solution to the Kosovo crisis through a mixture of military measures and, of course, political activities. It must be clear to all that we must not confuse cause and effect. The cause of the conflict is Milosevic"s criminal policy and the sole purpose of the effect we want to achieve by, for example, the military measures, is to protect the people in Kosovo and to reach a political solution. Let me emphatically underline what was said here. Our intention is not to punish anyone but to achieve the designated objective of bringing an end to a humanitarian disaster that is expanding and accelerating, so as to prevent even more people from dying.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to be able to say that the Council and Parliament are entirely at one on this!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding the critical comments on the Berlin results, I fully understand what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for instance, said about agricultural policy and the fact that we did not manage to achieve all our objectives, not even those which, looked at in isolation, can be regarded as extremely sensible, such as stabilising smaller undertakings even more than proved possible. That is partly because the different Member States have different interests and want to assert them. Of course the agricultural part, like the part relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds and like the financing part, is in fact a compromise, with all the strengths but also the weaknesses of any compromise. To reassure you, let me say to you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that if I had been able to act on my own, I would have responded more closely to your wishes! But that was not possible, as everyone will easily understand – nor indeed was it at all desirable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding the Structural and Cohesion Funds, I noted that we did not match up to some of your expectations. Nor could we, for some Member States are mainly contributors to these funds – and I do not just mean Germany, do not misunderstand me here – while others profit from both funds.</p>
<p class="contents">That quite naturally creates opposing interests, that can only be reconciled through compromise. I believe that in regard to the size and shape of the two funds, it has become clear that all in all we have found a sensible compromise. As far as Parliament"s interests are concerned, there will after all still be negotiations about flexibility and other similar demands that have been made. I believe these negotiations will be conducted in an equally determined and purposeful manner. At any rate, that is what the Council wants, as in the case of the negotiations that have now been concluded on preparing for the necessary legal acts. Here I am optimistic that we will manage to achieve the sensible measure of flexibility that Parliament wants.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I can only underline what has been said about further‐reaching aims. Of course what we must now do is to get the institutional reform underway, and not least because besides the financial architecture, institutional reform is one of the real conditions for the success of the enlargement process. Only if we manage really to achieve the institutional reforms in parallel with the accession negotiations will we be able to keep to the scheduled timetable for accession. Without institutional reforms, the greater Europe, one that does not stop at the eastern border of Germany, would become ungovernable. I believe that the Members of this Parliament know that, but the Council knows it too. This is indeed one of the very major tasks, and although it cannot be achieved during our presidency we can at least get it underway.</p>
<p class="contents">On the two other major objectives referred to in this debate, namely to draw up the common foreign and security policy, to safeguard it institutionally and to appoint a genuinely important and significant personality to represent and conduct this common foreign policy, in Cologne we want to decide on the person to be appointed and of course make progress in substantive terms. Here too we feel we are being held accountable to Parliament, and quite rightly so. We really do want to work on this. It must be equally clear – and here I am especially addressing the critics of European employment policy – that European employment policy, the employment pact we want to forge, must not be seen as a substitute for national employment policies. It would be quite wrong to perceive it as such; rather, it should be seen as usefully supplementing national policies. That is the aim we are pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we could manage to direct the Member States" considerable resources more towards this objective through coordinated national budgetary policies, and if, on top of that, we could also manage to direct European resources towards this objective, then I believe we really would be doing something to combat unemployment, especially youth unemployment, in Europe. We would also be making an immense contribution towards anchoring the idea of Europe more firmly in the minds of our young people than some of us may have managed in the past. That is what we want to discuss and set in motion in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of relations with Parliament, let me offer a concluding remark. Like any head of government controlled and elected by Parliament, I naturally respect the Members of Parliament. But as a government we are self‐assured enough to indeed accept and recognize the rights of the MEPs but also to point out that it is still up to us to legitimise policies, such as expenditure policy, so long as there are no radical changes. We have to explain to people why and how much they are to pay out and what for. That form of legitimation also gives us a certain self‐assurance. I look forward to a constructive dialogue with Members of Parliament, with Parliament itself, in which no‐one gives any special treatment to anyone else but both sides know that Europe can prosper only if the institutions are able and become even more able to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I have one more point to make. It is a question of the <span class="italic">ceterum censeo</span> that has been mentioned in many statements, the <span class="italic">ceterum censeo</span> about inviting the President to today"s informal meeting. We have on occasion issued such an invitation, and we will do so again. The reason for our decision today is quite simple. Firstly, I will be seeing the President and talking to him very soon, and secondly we really convened this informal summit in order to talk with Mr Prodi. Parliament has already had talks with Mr Prodi, so an invitation did not seem necessary. Moreover, it was clear that against the background of developments, in this situation the Heads of State and Government cannot meet without discussing Kosovo. We have exactly an hour and a half for this. That is the reason why we did not invite the President of your Parliament, it is not because of any reservations about the President and even less about Parliament – and we will certainly not make a habit of this. Even if indeed you cannot agree, at least I would ask you to understand and to believe me when I say it was neither a question of disrespect nor of rudeness, but simply a question of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have managed to answer some of the objections. I thank the Members of this Parliament and the President for giving me an opportunity to speak here. It was an honour. And I also thank you for letting me reply to your statements. I wish you much success in your work and much success for all of us who are in and for Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">In my view, this is because euroscepticism has given way to europhobia among our political leaders. The result is that the European Union is not equipping itself with the necessary political and economic resources to achieve its aims, on paper at least. This indecision has been borne out by the crisis in Kosovo, where the ineffectual implementation of the common foreign and security policy has been unable to prevent the crisis from escalating and has once again allowed the United States to become the major force in our region.</p>
<p class="contents">On issues relating to Agenda 2000, there were also discrepancies between our words and our actions. Of course, we are glad that some form of compromise was reached. However, that compromise led to an economic package that is substantially smaller than that proposed by the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, we welcome the fact that the solutions that were chosen – which relate to the partnership principle, the performance efficiency reserve, and so on – do not differ from the proposals put forward by Parliament. As regards the economic support given to the four poorest countries, it was decided that it would be best to maintain per capita expenditure at 1999 levels. This may satisfy Spain, Portugal and Ireland. However, I cannot understand why this solution satisfied my country, Greece, when it is well known that it is the poorest country and the only country which comes under Objective 1 in its entirety. Nor can I understand why it accepted the increase from 55 % to 62 % in Spain"s share of the Cohesion Fund, and the reduction of its own share from 18 % to 17 %. But, as Kipling would say, that is another story.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Berlin was worth the journey, as we have heard here today several times. But it will take a lot more work before the objectives set out by the Berlin European Council have an impact on the ground. That applies in particular to the important issue for the future, ‘enlargement", which has rightly been addressed repeatedly here today. The slogan here runs: rather than drawing away in fear we must move towards one another. In an exemplary joint effort, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have made the Interreg Community initiative stand as a signal for cooperation beyond the existing external border of the EU. Many thanks, Commissioner!</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must ensure that European legal texts and European aid money lead to constructive cooperation between the people on either side of the EU border. In my own country, Austria, as also in other Member States bordering on the applicant countries, we have an opportunity to turn the idea of European cooperation into reality with concrete projects. Let us do so! We also have this kind of very concrete cooperation between the European institutions and the European people in my own country at present, on a different European issue, the question of the refugees in and from Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In Austria the people themselves, vigorously supported by the media, by radio, TV and the press, have sent out their own very personal European signal in the form of an exemplary action called ‘Neighbour in Need". In the space of a few days the people – first and foremost it is the ordinary people, who find it hard enough to live on their incomes as it is – have already donated more than 100 million Austrian schillings. That is tangible proof of the European solidarity that we, the political office‐holders in Europe, all too often call for in word alone. We, the Council and Parliament as the European budgetary authority, should take a leaf from their book.</p>

<p class="contents">The first reason for this is that the courage needed to alter the status quo<span class="italic"> </span> of Community policies and their distributive effects was lacking. The second is that financing the enlargement of the Union means there will be no growth in structural and cohesion policies and there will be delay in financial and agricultural reforms. Thirdly, no provision has been made for any special mechanism to assist the adjustment of weaker and more vulnerable economies to enlargement – my own country, for example. Fourthly, the status quo has essentially been maintained for the CAP, which means that it will continue to treat the farmers of the European Union unequally. Furthermore, the CAP will not facilitate negotiations at the next WTO round in three years" time, at which we will come under enormous external pressure to make further reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with respect to Portugal, I feel that the agreement on the Structural Funds would not have been a bad one were we not in the process of enlarging the European Union. As Portugal is the country which has most to lose from enlargement and we have been offered no compensation whatsoever, it was a bad agreement. And the reform of the CAP was even worse, as the most backward agricultural economy in the European Union has not even been granted the right to increase its area of irrigated land, not just to accommodate the major Alqueva project but also more generally. It is impossible to carry out any modernisation in a region like ours without increasing irrigation.</p>

The partial adoption by the Council of the Commission"s price cutting proposals in the milk, cereals and beef and veal sector will bring these prices closer to the world market level, but the proposed compensatory payments go no way near to covering the income losses. Now we are told the milk market reform is only to begin in the year 2005, in three phases, and that the quota system is to expire in 2008. We welcome the idea of optional set‐aside. That is something we called for. In the case of cereals too, the agreements will initially run only until the year 2002, when adjustments are to be made if necessary. Further price cuts of 5 % are under discussion, but on the basis that then the compensation could be raised again from EUR 63 to EUR 66 a tonne. But obviously nobody noticed that this hit the oilseed farmers particularly hard. After the compromise reached by the agriculture ministers, they were sure of obtaining EUR 66, but now it will only be 63. On the other hand we welcome the fact that set‐aside is still fixed at 10 % until the year 2006. In regard to beef and veal, the Agenda decisions resolve neither the surplus nor the income problem. The mother‐cow breeders have won, the traditional bull‐fatteners have lost. That is the simple outcome of the Agenda, my dear President‐in‐Office of the Council!</p>

<p class="contents">The financial agreement concluded in Berlin is today an important success that could not be repeated under the present circumstances. For this reason, some of us fully support it despite the fact that, although it is a good agreement, it does not fully satisfy everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fulfill a legitimate wish, some of us are also prepared to oppose an increase in the budgetary powers of this House if it means jeopardising the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The political message in this resolution threatens rejection of the Berlin financial perspective. It also leads to a risky annual budgetary procedure that does not guarantee allocations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds. In financial terms, our opinion differs from that of the Council by only 0.38 % of the total approved in Berlin for the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Santer pointed out, an agreement is around the corner and must be reached without any further delay and by June at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem is that there is a political trend in this House that favours an annual budgetary procedure without financial categories and, consequently, without fixed year on year amounts for structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We can begin to understand this way of thinking even though we are against it, but we cannot understand how those who opt for this path are those who have a duty to defend a European model of economic and social cohesion.</p>
