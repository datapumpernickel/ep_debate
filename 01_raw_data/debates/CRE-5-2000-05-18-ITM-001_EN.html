You will remember that I informed the House at the time that I would ask the Legal Affairs Committee, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, to give an opinion on this issue. This committee has, on several occasions, examined all the aspects, particularly the legal ones, of this issue. I thank Mrs Palacio, the committee’s chairperson, and the committee members for their efforts. The discussions were extremely thorough and it was only yesterday, at 8 p.m., that I received Mrs Palacio’s letter informing me of the committee’s opinion on this issue. So that there is no room for error or misinterpretation, I would prefer to read you the letter.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Madam President, during its meeting of 16 May 2000, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market re-examined the situation of Mr Le Pen. The committee is aware that the decree of the Prime Minister of the French Republic, of which Mr Le Pen was notified on 5 April 2000, and which was published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 22 April 2000, has become enforceable. However, the committee has also noted, as mentioned in the letter notifying Mr Le Pen of the decree, that the latter has the option of appealing to the French Council of State. This appeal may be accompanied by a request to suspend the enforcement of the decree.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the decision taken the day before not to recommend at present that Parliament officially take note of the decree regarding Mr Le Pen, the committee has examined the possible responses. The case of Mr Tapie was mentioned as a precedent to be followed in support of this decision. The result is that the European Parliament should officially take note of the decree withdrawing Mr Le Pen’s mandate only after expiry of the deadline for appealing to the French Council of State or, if applicable, after a decision by the latter’.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the contents of the letter sent to me yesterday evening by Mrs Palacio on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee. Once again, I thank her. I intend to abide by the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am immensely relieved that he appears not to be as ill as he appeared at the beginning. I am a nurse which is why I went up to see if I could give assistance. We have to recognise that, particularly when the weather gets as hot as it did this week, colleagues’ health is under a great deal of stress. It is unfortunate that it took a considerable time to get the stretcher to take Mr Staes out of the Chamber. I would propose on behalf of colleagues that we have immediate resuscitation equipment here in the Chamber in case such a distressing event occurs again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that he is not as ill as he looked, but we must have resuscitative equipment in the House, given not only the conditions but some of our ages and I include myself in that.

However, we have all made a free choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I will return to the issue we were discussing: my Group’s request for this House to express its opinion in accordance with the regulations. I was reading Article 12(2) of the Act of 1976, which is the legal basis cited by the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee in her letter of Monday. This paragraph says: “Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the European Parliament, which shall take note of the fact”.</p>
<p class="contents">France is a constitutional state. There has been a legal judgement, a government decree, which has been communicated to us and I believe it falls to the European Parliament to take note of it in accordance with the Treaties and with parliamentary law. I have heard – because I do not have first-hand knowledge of the letter – that precedents are cited. There certainly are precedents and my Group believes they should be respected. However, in this case, we should not cite the precedent of Mr Tapie for two reasons: firstly, he was ineligible for reasons of bankruptcy, and, secondly – and this is important – he had used his right to appeal. Here we have a case of ineligibility for one year and the right to appeal, recognised in the French decree, has not been used.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to enter into a debate on French law, since I have no knowledge of it. I believe that, in accordance with the Treaties and our Rules, Parliament must take note of the decision of the French State. This is the correct procedure and I think that, although I was not present in the Committee on Legal Affairs, the proposal does not reflect it. In any event, I believe that this proposal should not be ratified by the European Parliament, I am going to request that it be put to the vote and I would like to say that my Group will vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was very surprised by the letter which you have just read from the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I received a letter from the chairperson, which faithfully reflected what had happened in the Legal Affairs Committee: following a discussion, it was decided not to recommend that Parliament take note, leaving the issue on the table for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The letter which you have read reflects the personal motives which the chairperson and perhaps other MEPs put forward, but which does not reflect the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the Socialist Group’s position was that, in view of the Act of 1976, all this Parliament could do is what Mr Barón just said, that is to say, take note <span class="italic">(prendre acte)</span> of the decision of the French Government, with no other condition.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of giving an explanation was raised, and I argued that that would mean a new vote. No new vote took place and therefore – I repeat – the views expressed in the letter which you have just read reflect Mrs Palacio’s personal position and not the position of the Legal Affairs Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because in our statutory law, in our Rules of Procedure, there is no explicit mention of how to proceed in a situation such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to point out that there is doubtless confusion here. Madam President, you have consulted the Legal Affairs Committee on the basis of a purely formal decision. As on other occasions, such as, for example, when the Legal Affairs Committee examines whether or not to lodge an appeal in the Court of Justice, we are talking about a purely technical assessment by an internal body of Parliament, which makes a recommendation to the President, the external body of Parliament, who is expected to take the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I respect what Mr Barón Crespo says. His views were discussed and examined in depth by the Legal Affairs Committee. Allow me to refer to what was said in this committee. Firstly, Mr Barón says that there is no similarity with the Tapie case because the ineligibility in that case stemmed from a bankruptcy and in this case it stems from a criminal conviction. I do not personally share that view, and I believe that, according to the relevant law, there are reasons not to share it, because, in any event, we are talking about two sentences, both from French courts and both leading to ineligibility. It makes no sense now to look into the reason for the sentence. The sentence exists. The fact that it involves ineligibility is what concerns us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón’s second argument concerning the difference between the cases related to the fact that Mr Le Pen has not lodged an appeal and that Mr Tapie had. I do not share this view either, and nor did the majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, because Mr Le Pen is still within the time limit for lodging an appeal. We therefore cannot go against something, to which he is entitled under French law: to lodge an appeal within a certain time limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me now to refute Mr Medina’s statement on his interpretation of the matter. I would like to do this calmly, although I consider it to be absolutely unjustified and to warrant a more forceful response. However, in my capacity as chairperson, I must point out that the two letters are complementary. In the first letter, Madam President, you were informed that the Legal Affairs Committee had taken a decision not to take note of the judgement for the moment, bearing in mind that it is not final. It is enforceable but not final. In the second paragraph it said: “tomorrow we will continue to discuss this issue”.</p>
<p class="contents">The second letter refers to what happened at the second meeting and all the members of the Legal Affairs Committee know that that was how I presented it. In no way was there any intention to hold a vote, but simply a discussion. I personally, as rapporteur, was going to propose a basis for discussion. There was therefore no place for a vote on the issue and I had stated that on the previous day. The vote had already taken place in the Legal Affairs Committee. Madam President, I did inform you of what happened in that debate and why it did not continue, and it did not do so basically because there was insistence on the issue of the Tapie case.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Legal Affairs Committee can vote on anything, but since it was not laid down and since it was dealing with such an important and serious issue which did not appear in the agenda, it did not seem to me to be reasonable to hold a vote if we were taking a route which all the speakers – and this is recorded in the Minutes – for one reason or another, rejected. Furthermore, the Minutes also show that I said that a committee chairperson rarely obtained such a degree of unanimity with regard to a proposal. I say this in order to refute these statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make a comment in relation to the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Rule 7(4) is being cited. That paragraph – in the event that we had to resort to it, which I do not believe to be the case, and I will explain why – states that Parliament may express its opinion on a proposal. Madam President, there is no proposal to the plenary here. I believe that, in order to vote honestly, on an issue as delicate as this, if Parliament has to vote, a report should be produced in accordance with the rules, so that everybody may vote as they see fit, and not be influenced by allegations from one side or the other, bearing in mind that, in actual fact, the majority of MEPs are not aware of the background to this issue. Therefore, if the President wishes to take this route, a report by the Legal Affairs Committee is absolutely essential and it would be irregular not to proceed in that way,...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Noise)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... for Parliament to express its opinion on an issue for which there is no written document or anything whatsoever, and which requires legal consideration at the highest level. It is absolutely irregular and contrary to the Rule that has been cited…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... because, Madam President, a majority in the Legal Affairs Committee considered, on purely legal bases, that we could not take note of this loss of MEP status.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in my opinion, furthermore, this article is not applicable, and I will tell you why: Parliament is asked to take note. It does not have the option of making a political assessment. It is in the nature of all decisions in plenary that they be taken from a political point of view. In this case we are talking about a purely formal legal assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that it falls to the President to take this decision, and you may consult the Rules of Procedure, which states that you must consult the Legal Affairs Committee. An analysis could be made of the reasons why the Legal Affairs Committee should be consulted, as the internal advisory body in this case. I am prepared to make this analysis, because I have done so before.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you can consult any other internal body and, in particular ...</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to repeat the discussions of the Legal Affairs Committee. However, it was totally proper that we should hear the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee which has carried out some extremely difficult and meticulous work on a very delicate issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept full responsibility in this matter. Under the terms of the Treaty I could no doubt have quite simply noted the decree. However, and I take responsibility for this, I preferred to refer to Rule 7(4) and obtain an opinion from the Legal Affairs Committee. This was because I regarded the problem as being legally very delicate. I therefore wanted it to be considered regardless of any political considerations so that the case of the Member in question was dealt with as that of any other Member would be. This is how Parliament must always act, in a very rigorous manner.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">It appears in this case that the person concerned has the option of appealing and that this appeal may be accompanied by a stay of execution. However, from the moment when the European Parliament officially takes note of the decree, the decision will immediately become enforceable. In other words, the option to appeal and the stay of execution will not be possible. This situation cannot be reversed since, if the appeal were successful, we could not tell the new Member to leave in order to allow the former Member to come back. You can imagine the problems this would cause! This is therefore an extremely important responsibility for both your President and this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore referred to Rule 7(4), which seemed wholly appropriate to the situation, and asked for the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee. Once again, I thank the committee for the long hours which its chairperson and members have devoted to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that I have this opinion, I could ignore it. However, although my decision may be disputed, I have decided to abide by the committee’s opinion. This being so, Mr Barón Crespo was right to read carefully the paragraph to which I referred which states that: “He [the President] shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter”. This, effectively, is what our Rules of Procedure say. When we have heard from the Members who wish to speak – and I would ask you not to repeat the discussions on this issue – it would be appropriate to consult the House as to whether it wishes to adopt a position on the committee’s opinion. If so, this vote would be included in voting time at midday.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my proposal. There is no perfect solution so we must all try to act with the greatest rigour and fairness.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to spend the whole morning on this. I would ask you to be brief and we will then take whatever seems to be the best decision. This decision is yours to make as this is a very serious issue. I would remind you that it is in fact Parliament which will officially take note of the decree and not its President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The person in question holds political views most of which I find loathsome. But there are legal systems in the European Union and I would always defend the rights of all Members of the European Parliament under those legal systems. If legal proceedings are being taken against a Member of this House in a Member State, then we should await the outcome of those proceedings before we can make a final decision here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hänsch, if my information is correct, and I have not had a chance to talk to you about this, but I say this with all due respect to our former President, Klaus Hänsch, then our former President specifically made the same point in relation to the Tapie case, that is to say that we should await the outcome of the appeal procedure before we reach a decision here. What was right then cannot be wrong now. We must respect the rights of every individual Member of this House, whatever his political views are. My Group will always argue for that, even if the Members involved belong to other groups. We will defend these rights with equal vigour, because they are our common rights. If we violate the law, we can say goodbye to the European Union. That is why we respect and defend the law – no matter who it applies to.</p>

<p class="contents">I have received a request for Parliament to adopt a position. In my opinion, I must logically, as a result of using this Rule, not put the committee’s opinion to the vote, but hold a vote to find out who wants us to vote on this opinion. Is this now clear to everyone?</p>

The House should realise, from the fact that this matter has occupied our Committee for a period of three very long and exhaustive meetings, that it was felt to be a very complex and difficult issue to deal with. I for one would feel it wrong for this House to try to look at this matter in a hurry, which seems to be the proposal being put forward by Mr Barón Crespo.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules. As I understand the rule in question, which, Madame President, you are carefully trying to construe, there is at the moment an opinion before you from the Legal Affairs Committee but there is not a proposal as such. The rule talks about Parliament having a right to give a view on a proposal, but it seems that you have merely an opinion, not a proposal. If we were to take a view as a full Parliament, then we should have something more in front of us and a great deal more time and careful consideration before we enter into such a hasty vote on an issue such as this.</p>

<p class="contents">You can get an idea of the confusion which reigned within the Legal Affairs Committee during the examination of this issue when someone like Mrs Hautala is under the impression that this is a question of waiving parliamentary immunity. This is not at all the case and it is in this climate of confusion within the committee that a roughly equal number of votes for and against were cast, hence this proposal.</p>

<p class="contents">This is what happened. I completely agree with Mr Poettering that the law must be respected: French law is what it is, however, whether you agree with it or not. In this situation, French law stipulates that the government must assume its responsibilities based on a judgement from a tribunal. In other words, it must publish the decree withdrawing the mandate and we unfortunately have no choice but to take note of this officially. Whether this is a good or bad thing, it is a situation which I felt I had to clarify. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will read to you the letter that Mr Hänsch sent to Mr Hervé de Charrette, the then French Foreign Minister, at the time of the Tapie affair. The most important paragraph states that: “Due to the irreversible nature of the withdrawal of the mandate, it seems to me appropriate to wait for the Council of State to rule on this appeal. It appears that the Council of State’s decision on the stay of execution will be taken imminently”. As you can see, and we cannot get into a discussion on this, I too looked at what my predecessors did in similar situations because case law does, rightfully, exist.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a difficult position. I propose that we decide whether or not we want the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal, as some of you seem to think that the letter written to me by Mrs Palacio is not a proposal within the terms of the Rules of Procedure. Personally, I must abide by the Rules of Procedure which state that: “On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter”. If Parliament, therefore, wants a genuine proposal, we will ask the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up this proposal on which we can calmly vote, not at midday, but a little later perhaps.</p>
<p class="contents">We must resolve this situation. I will therefore immediately put the two possible solutions to the vote. The first is that we keep to the current position which is to abide by the terms of Mrs Palacio’s letter and await the outcome of any appeal lodged with the Council of State by the Member in question, before officially noting the withdrawal or otherwise of the mandate. The second solution is that the plenary asks the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal on which Parliament will adopt a position in accordance with Rule 7(4). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have reached an impasse. I fully understand that you want Mr Le Pen to lose his mandate. Fortunately, however, this issue does not depend on our political desires but on the law and on the fact that, at the moment, we are faced with a legal situation which goes against what you are proposing and which is forcing us into a stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">The President is right. Either this is a legal proposal from the committee and we can vote on this basis or this is not a legal proposal, in which case you are asking for one to be drawn up. If you want a vote as an indication of our position, that is entirely up to you, but it would be wise to reject this as I believe there is a contradiction. I do not often agree with Mrs Garaud but in this case she is right. There is a contradiction in French law which states that a decision is not final and not suspensive. Understand that if you can, but it is up to the French Parliament to reform this law.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion – and on this point, Mr Wurtz, I cannot agree with you – the French State, the Italian State and the German State are sovereign. The European Parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision. This is my conception of Europe. In the current situation, I would simply ask you to say that we will wait and press for a decision by the Council of State as to whether or not Mr Le Pen’s request is suspensive. This can happen very quickly. This would not be a decision on the substance, even though it is purely a legal matter, but on the form. If the Council of State decides today that its decision is not suspensive, the European Parliament can, within 48 hours, take the necessary decision. I would therefore ask you to withdraw your request for a vote so that we do not reach a total impasse.</p>

<p class="contents">My second point is that you decided, on the basis of Rule 7(4), to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. That is your right.

There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up. I have in mind the difference between Article 12 of the Act on the election of Members by direct universal suffrage and Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure. There is a discrepancy here.</p>
