It therefore allows the Union to reaffirm that the protection of its citizens is one of its fundamental principles. It also gives us an opportunity to put an end to a recurrent conflict between the European institutions by clarifying the distribution of competences between the first and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">The case before the Court of Justice concerned an environmental protection directive that carried criminal penalties and was the subject of the Di Lello report of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. We agree with the European Commission’s analysis. This judgment’s consequences go far beyond environmental protection and are likely to affect all Community policies and the fundamental freedoms recognised by the Treaty. Serious encroachments on citizens’ fundamental rights must incur effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties. That is what we want for the data retention directive, for example, because it will have a significant effect on the private lives of European citizens. One of the major consequences is therefore that the codecision procedure will apply in areas that were formerly the subject of unanimous voting with the European Parliament merely giving its opinion. The judgment gives the European Parliament a deciding role and this strengthening of democratic control is a step forward for democracy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has identified a number of framework decisions adopted on an erroneous legal basis. The definition of such penalties should refer to Community provisions relating to the protection of fundamental rights. I will therefore end with a specific question to the Commissioner: does the Commission also plan to review the framework decision on racism and xenophobia in this way? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, along with Mrs Roure and the Commission, I share the view that this pertains not only to environmental matters, but has repercussions in many more areas. The Commission has produced a list of decisions that need adjusting – about which I will say something in a moment – but there is also an important decision underway that has been the subject of many debates, namely the decision on data retention. The Commission knows that Parliament sets great store by the fact that an enormous amount of data will probably be collected but will be used for limited purposes. Am I right in concluding from the judgment that legally, we can impose a penalty if this data is misused? Whilst this is, of course, a matter of political resolve that we have to reach a decision of this kind, it is legally possible, and would that penalty legally apply, not only for the providers but also for the government?</p>
<p class="contents">The other point is about implementing this list so that it is legally in order. I share the Commission’s view in this, namely that we should not subject everything to a codecision procedure, and that we should make pragmatic adjustments to some extent, although I have reservations, because sometimes, there are aspects, such as facilitating unauthorised entry, which I know for a fact presented my group with a major dilemma. Indeed, there are people who help others to enter the EU because they think those people really need political asylum. I think that we should draw a distinction between people who help others for financial gain and others who really do this out of non-commercial motives. Whilst in my case, I am still undecided as to whether we can carry out all those adjustments so easily, I do share the view that a whole new codecision procedure would probably be unwarranted for the lion’s share of the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am taking advantage of the fact that I have not been silenced to add a quick question of my own. Article 13, which refers to the old existing anti-discrimination directives, does enable the Member States to impose their own penalties if they consider this to be proportionate and effective. Would it not be possible at some stage, to table a proposal to that effect, to throw this open to the whole of Europe in order to demonstrate that we consider this so important for the civil rights, that we in Europe think that any instance of discrimination should incur a financial sanction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Roure and Mrs Buitenweg for having raised this question, which is of key importance in Europe in terms of its space of legal competence in the field of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the approach of both speeches and can promise that the Commission will make sure that this important decision by the European Court of Justice is applied in full, putting into practice its core principle, namely that when it is necessary to guarantee the effectiveness of Community regulations, criminal sanctions can be introduced by the Community legislator via the codecision procedure, and by that means only.</p>
<p class="contents">This opens up a very broad and significant area, both for the full involvement of Parliament, and as a way of moving beyond the intergovernmental approach, which up to now has prevailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, when drafting the proposals for the introduction of criminal sanctions, the Commission will have to hold to two main principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the need for criminal legislation, because criminal sanctions can only be imposed when necessary. This is a universal principle of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the consistency of the various provisions: once again, contradictions within criminal provisions must be avoided otherwise there could in theory be grave legal uncertainty, precisely because of a lack of consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified certain areas in which the decision of the Court may be applied in practice. As you are no doubt aware, we have decided to appeal to the Court of Justice in relation to the framework decision on marine pollution. We did this a few days ago because the time limit for an appeal had not yet expired and we considered it opportune to give an immediate demonstration by contesting the framework decision on marine pollution before the Court. We consider this to be one of the subjects on which a directive containing criminal sanctions should have been adopted, rather than a framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also proposed a means of extending this <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>to other fields. When, for example, a framework decision has already been handed down, one could, without altering the substance of the text, use an agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission to adopt the correct legal basis whilst avoiding having to open a discussion on the substance as well. This type of solution would speed matters up greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">A final response on the two subjects of racism and non-discrimination. Obviously I am in favour of adopting legislation which criminally penalises at least incitement to racial hatred, and hence to committing acts of racism. In this area criminal sanctions are undoubtedly necessary, even if, as I am sure you know, agreement has unfortunately not even yet been reached on the framework decision. I promised that in early 2006 I would propose a new initiative on racism and xenophobia in order to overcome the obstruction that has occurred within the Council. Article 13 of the Treaty may be used instead to introduce criminal sanctions in cases of discrimination based on race or nationality. The means exist, most obviously in Article 13, which undoubtedly forms the subject of a directive, and is therefore chiefly a Community matter. In such cases the Commission may also adopt proposals for criminal legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are aware, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was not keen for this debate to take place this evening. We feel it would have made more sense if, before anything else, the parliamentary committees concerned had carefully analysed the Commission communication on this judgment. Apart from that procedural difference, however, we are broadly in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on his answers to the Chamber and on the Court’s decision, which addresses our concern to strengthen Community law and the first pillar, and the decisions that we can make in areas such as these under the scope of the first pillar, rather than the third.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore appear that the Court recognises that criminal law and the criminal justice system do not fall under the Community’s jurisdiction, but that this does not stop the Community legislature from adopting measures relating to criminal penalties in the Member States, provided that they are consistent and necessary in order to safeguard the efficacy of Community law. A useful precedent has been set. I feel that the Commission will make use of that precedent, and Mr Frattini can rest assured that Parliament, for its part, will also make use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roure talked of the impact that this agreement will have, not only on environmental issues, but in a number of other areas as well, including what we consider to be the most crucial area, namely that of fundamental freedoms when it is necessary to impose criminal penalties in order to ensure their effectiveness. One of the consequences to which you referred, Commissioner, is that some framework decisions were adopted on unsound legal grounds. The judgment mentions seven framework decisions, I believe. This situation must therefore be regularised by means of the quick and simple adoption of Community instruments to replace these framework decisions under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What I should like to ask you, Commissioner, is whether you can give us some indication of the timetable that the Commission will follow for presenting these initiatives, in order that, under the codecision procedure, we can quickly bypass the legal framework that is bypassed by the judgment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Legal Affairs heard your representatives, and we have now received the communication from the Commission, the substance of which we welcome along with that of the decision by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a good thing that the Commission should have stated clearly that this decision by the Court of Justice is applicable in situations other than that which gave rise to it – which was environmental in character –and affects all policies, notably including the four freedoms referred to in the Treaty. There have also been proposals that its applicability be restricted to the objectives of Article 2, something to which I expressed my opposition in the Committee, for which reason I approve of the way the Commission has framed its position on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">What we, together, have to sort out is how we will, if it comes to it, go about transferring more acts from the third pillar to the first. You have described the principles behind the two ways in which we might do this. The first would involve not making any substantial changes, but merely changing the legal basis and concluding an inter-institutional agreement to obviate the need to have the content of the whole thing gone through again. The second option would be to have a proper codecision procedure, with the Commission having the opportunity to make substantial alterations to the content, and it is this approach that I favour, subject to what is said in future debates, as being, in my view, more suited to the present day. We have 10 new Member States, who surely also have an interest in now making the contribution to the legal acts that they were, of course, unable to make before accession. Unless, then, I am persuaded that there is a better way of doing it, I am in favour of this matter being dealt with through the normal legislative process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thus, without a treaty, without a mandate and against the wishes of the Member States and the Council, the Court of Justice and the Commission have agreed to use this judicial communitisation of criminal law to merge the pillars of competences within the Union. That was one of the objectives of the Constitutional Treaty which, if I may remind those of our fellow Members who still refuse to accept the fact, has been rejected and has become null and void under international law. The Commission has clearly lost no time in stepping into the breach this opened up. On 23 November last, it added to criminal environmental law an initial list of nine new criminal competences it was unilaterally removing from the Member States. This continued absorption of national competences is also reflected in the future European civil code, which is still being prepared, with no legal basis, by the Von Bar Group with a EUR 5 million subsidy from the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the supranational institutions using some mysterious hegemonic principle that says the nations do not matter or are an obstacle to be overcome, to take their revenge for the referenda of 29 May and 1 June? These judicial shows of strength are distorting the model of Europe that our countries agreed to. We are faced with what French Constitutional Council President Pierre Mazeaud feared at the start of the year: a serious defect of consent. I therefore want to say, quietly but solemnly, that those in this House who fail to respond to these shows of strength are committing an act against their governments, against their parliaments, against their constitutions, against the European treaties themselves and against the nations and are paving the way for renewed insurrections, not only electoral ones, against a Europe that is emphatically no longer their own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, in the field of criminal sanctions, the Council will no longer be able to use Title VI to make unilateral decisions without the intervention of the European Parliament as colegislator. I believe this to be a great advance and a great result which does credit to the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear that, without the intervention of Parliament, a fundamental principle of democracy, namely <span class="italic">nulla poena sine lege</span>, would have been overlooked rather than reaffirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice, whilst recognising, obviously, that the Community cannot establish criminal sanctions or achieve harmonisation of criminal law, has provided that – if criminal sanctions are essential to achieve the requirements or aims of the Treaty – the Community can oblige Member States to provide for them and apply them. This means that if the Community has competence to regulate conduct in order to achieve a particular aim, it also has competence to decide if that conduct may be punished at a national level through recourse to administrative or criminal sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions are therefore called upon to carry out the ruling of the Court of Justice and – here I address myself particularly to the Commissioner – the European Commission has given certain indications as to how it will act.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that merely transferring the provisions contained in a framework decision to a community directive is unacceptable if this transfer is not carried out with full respect for the prerogatives of the European Parliament. Parliament must be able to intervene on substance if the legal basis provides that it is colegislator.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the pending legislative proposals are concerned, I am grateful to the Commissioner if the Commission is taking steps to withdraw them or replace them with new proposals consistent with the case-law of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs will continue to see that community law and the prerogatives of Parliament are respected. Very precise guidelines will be laid down in an own-initiative report, for which we have already asked for authorisation in advance, and with which the Committee on Justice will concern itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time since King Henry VIII ended the jurisdiction of the Pope in ecclesiastical matters in England, a power other than the British Parliament will have the right to create laws and set the penalties for transgression. The European Court of Justice is not a court of justice, it is an engine of political integration for the European Union. This particular ruling applied only to environmental law, but it has left the way wide open for the Commission to apply it to other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has ruthlessly exploited the decision of the court in order to publish a list of nine new areas of competence, which gives it the right to create new laws and impose criminal penalties. It has also stated its intention to extend its power to create further criminal offences. When this case first went to the court, 11 of the then 15 Member States opposed it; the court ignored them. A Commission lawyer has stated that it could compel the British Government – and the British Parliament – to punish its citizens for something that was not a criminal offence in Britain. If a British government were to refuse to implement these criminal offences, then it could be taken to the European Court of Justice, which would compel it to do so. The court would then act as judge and jury in its own case. So much for the separation of powers of the executive, legislative and judiciary that has protected English freedoms for centuries!</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the so-called European Court of Justice is nothing less than a judicial <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. The Court has seized power from the Member States and handed it to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking as a lawyer and a former Justice Minister in the United Kingdom, I have questions to ask Mr Frattini, and I will do so in an unemotional way, because I think this is a very interesting debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The competences of the European Court of Justice are undoubtedly a matter of considerable interest. I am interested in them, because as we develop areas in which the Court of Justice will have competence, we have to look at it in the relationship that it bears to the courts of the nation states in Europe and the competences that they carry in particular areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first opportunity we have had to debate this important ruling and I accept that the Commission naturally has an obligation as guardian of the Treaties to consider carefully the implications of the judgment. I certainly believe in Member State competence and prerogatives when it comes to the general area of criminal law. I am sure that is a view shared by most of the Member States. There is an issue regarding the European Court of Justice approach to jurisprudence, and by and large I think it is fair to say that we would not favour judge-made law, which can in certain circumstances be anti-democratic. I do not think it should be a pretext either for the Commission and Parliament to seek to carry out an extension of powers which conflict with Member States’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important, particularly as we know that the European Court of Justice does have a clear competence in many areas, that the parameters of the competences of that court are clearly defined. It is important that it is spelled out very clearly to us how those competences will operate when set alongside those of national courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always been fascinated by the work of the European Court of Justice. I was in Washington recently when Justice Roberts was going through his grilling to become the Chief Justice. It was interesting to note that most of his <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> was based upon the American Constitution, his interpretation of it and his delivery of decisions based upon it. A limited area, you might think, but indeed the areas flowing from it were very extensive indeed. I was deeply impressed by the way that the incoming Chief Justice dealt with those competences and his relationship with the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it is now time for us to hear of the ambitions and interests of the European Court of Justice, how it defines its role for the future and how it does so with a minimum of inconvenience and conflict with the nation-state courts themselves. I will be very interested to hear what Mr Frattini would like to say on that particular point in his summing-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the speeches I have heard I deduce that this subject cannot be exhausted in the short interval of time set aside for this evening’s debate. It is a subject of considerable importance for Europe’s space of legal competence and these latest observations on the relations between the European Court of Justice and the national courts also require careful consideration, which I will not fail to give them.</p>
<p class="contents">As is obvious, criminal law is intended to punish the unlawful conduct of individuals and, if the matter falls under Community competence, it seems frankly unlikely that Parliament – the institution representing democracy – should not participate in the creation of criminal law. That would mean that, if Parliament were excluded, only two of the European Community institutions – the Council and the Commission – would be participating in the decision-making process in matters of Community competence. That is a key justification for the ruling of the Court of Justice, as well as a principle which, naturally, we shall investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, can an incorrect legal basis be transformed into a correct legal basis? There are three methods that may be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been stated in several of your speeches – such as that of Mr Gargani – if it is necessary to change the substance of the measure, this is done by withdrawing the measure itself – for example, a framework decision – and replacing it with a proposal for a new directive, either on the legal basis, or on the substance, and thus applying the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It might, however, be possible – and I do not know if any cases of this sort exist – that a framework decision has a legal basis which proves to be irrelevant, whilst its content, on the other hand, is accepted. In such a case – if Parliament and the Council agree on the need to change only the legal basis, whilst upholding the content – I myself can see a second method, which consists not in withdrawing the proposal and replacing it with a new initiative, but rather in an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Council, through which, quickly and inexpensively, it may be agreed to alter the legal basis and uphold the substance. This is a hypothesis for which it would be very interesting to hear the evaluation of the Parliament’s Committee on Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there is a third way, which we have already applied a few days ago, and for which we await the decision of the Court: the appeal that is before the Court of Justice, contesting a framework decision containing an incorrect legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I wish to make it clear that the Commission will only ever exercise these competences if it proves necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal law is, I stress, a serious instrument of the legal system, which is why criminal legislation – which, as the founding fathers of law teach us, is the final remedy against the offences of individuals – must only be applied when it proves absolutely necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
