This role was first developed by President Plumb, following a request from many women in France whose children had been abducted and with whom they were no longer in contact. They were seeking Parliament's help. Since then, many other people have also sought the help of the European Parliament when their children have been abducted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked on these issues for over six years and, very much thanks to the help and resources of the European Parliament, have had several significant successes in recovering children who have been abducted. Most of the cases of child abduction are actually handled very efficiently and appropriately by the central authorities in all Member States. Unfortunately, I generally find myself dealing with the more complex cases.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of this regulation, which has been essentially rushed through during the French presidency, is the question of access to children by non-custodial parents. It has already been dubbed "the Brussels 3" issue, not so much a directive as a regulation. As such, it has the limitations of the Brussels 2 Convention, but also some of its strengths. It refers exclusively to children of couples who have married. It refers to children under the age of 16. It is also a directive whose scope has been described as both modest and pragmatic – and indeed it is a modest little regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The precise scope of it would cover parents, living in a different Member State from where the guardianship judgment was made, who were looking for visiting rights. It would allow the child to be brought to another Member State for a limited period in order for the visiting right to be exercised.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucial to its operation would be the principle that a judgment made on visiting rights in one Member State is recognised throughout the EU. An exception to this principle would be if the guardian parent proves that, due to new circumstances, the visit would endanger the physical and moral health of the child. Undoubtedly, this regulation will work in tandem with the Hague Convention on the transnational abduction of children. It does not seek to impose on other Member States the existing law of one Member State; it is simply an attempt at mutual enforcement of these custody orders.</p>
<p class="contents">There are constitutional concerns in some Member States, notably Germany and Austria. There is concern that the applicant parent can apply for access to the child, with only eight days for the other parent to respond to the request. Undoubtedly, many of our courts are very slow and ponderous, and there is great difficulty in getting them to act quickly on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also concern about the forcible return of a child. My belief is that the existence of good law, applicable in all Member States, has had a significant effect in reducing the number of abductions of children. Hopefully, this is what this regulation will ensure between Member States. Unfortunately, it does not apply outside the European Union, and there are fears that it will cut across the Hague Convention. But the Council of Ministers will discuss this, and I recommend its acceptance to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">The French initiative warrants a favourable welcome. It is part of the gradual development of judicial cooperation in civil matters and its communitisation. It is a proposal for a regulation that seeks to make exercising rights of access and accommodation for the children of separated parents easier, in an attempt to prevent children becoming a kind of hostage in the dispute between parents who are resident in different Member States. In these cases, situations unfortunately often occur that correspond to the cycle of love, hate and the desire for revenge of one or both of the parents. Hence the need for speed in order to protect the well-being of the children and, sometimes, their very safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe in which its citizens are able to move around freely, regardless of their State of origin, one can easily understand the ease with which family ties are established between people of different nationalities or who are resident in different countries. It is also understandable that lawsuits arise, specifically divorces and the regulation of parental power, which could lead to problems with regard to the exercise of rights of access when the child lives in another country, as in cases of abduction, particularly when the child is not returned by the parent who holds rights of access within the specified time.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation establishes the principle of mutual recognition of judgments for rights of access to children without any intermediary steps and limits the possibilities for seeking the suspension of the enforcement of such judgments. In this way, the regulation responds to the need for a direct application of uniform rules on such important issues as the regulation of parental power and the exercise of visiting rights. We are thereby improving Community spirit and European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless a matter for regret that the scope of this regulation is limited, since it does not cover the families of unmarried couples, in which there are children born outside of marriage, whose rights will not, as a result, be recognised and enforced under Community law. Now, this is a very common situation in our states. According to the latest statistics produced by Eurostat, in 1998, 26% of all births in the Union took place outside marriage and these numbers are continuing to increase. It is therefore crucial that this loophole must be plugged for reasons of fairness, of realism given the way society is changing and for the sake of equal rights and obligations for all of the European Union’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say in conclusion that I support the amendment proposed by the rapporteur in Article 1, in which it must be specified that the period of access should not be less than one day. In particular, we must take account of the fact that situations sometimes occur in which the parent comes from the other side of the Union, travelling thousands of kilometres, and so it is pointless to do this for a visit limited to one hour. This is ridiculous. Maintaining relations with both parents is an essential part of the child's upbringing and the development of his or her personality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate both the French Republic on its initiative to adopt a regulation to guarantee the right of personal contact between parents and their children and our rapporteur, Mrs Banotti, whose expertise added considerable value to the French proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe without borders has most certainly contributed to an increase in the number of marriages between couples with different nationalities from both the E.U. and third countries. But when such marriages break down, there are often problems of ensuring personal contact between children and one of the parents, especially when the children reside in another Member State. And, as previous speakers have already pointed out, there has also been an increase in the number of cases of abduction with the child not being returned by one of the parents. That is why this regulation, which seeks to simplify the enforcement of rights of the parents with the aim of ensuring that children are able to maintain regular contact with both parents, is of major significance.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the Brussels II Regulation, which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents. Mr Coelho gave some very pertinent statistics and, personally, I think it is an unacceptable anachronism that, in the Europe of the twenty-first century, we legislate simply with regard to conventionally legitimate children and institutionalised human relations and that we significantly limit the scope of a regulation which is good in all other respects. I believe that there is a need for an immediate review of all regulations based on standards which have been overtaken by life and by contemporary reality. It is also necessary to take the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union more seriously into account when hammering out regulations and to give more serious consideration to the repeatedly expressed views and positions of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Often, couples go their separate ways in a civilised manner. They find it unpleasant to continue sharing each other's lives, but they do not start hating their ex-partner. Unfortunately, others separate on the basis of accumulated hatred. Parents who separate on that basis are a disaster for their children who become victims of that insoluble conflict. One parent wants the absolute power of decision over the children in order to exclude the other parent forever.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is familiar with the awful situation in which the parent to whom custody of the child is awarded, often the mother, tries to make contact with the other parent impossible. We also recognise the equally terrible situation in which the other parent, often the father, abducts the child and makes him or her untraceable. Children remember that sort of occurrence for their whole lives. My mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago, and she still talks about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Banotti has tried to make creative use of all the possibilities for securing effective arrangements for parental access on a cross-border basis too. She is trying to preclude all situations in which parents can misuse the existence of different rules of law in the Member States of the European Union in order to delay or prevent effective arrangements for parental access. A part of her solution involves drastically curtailing the right to call in a judge in order to overturn a foreign court order.</p>
<p class="contents">That regulation will only work if both parents are nationals of an EU country or are resident within the European Union and if their relationship was confirmed by a legal marriage. Only a part of the problem will be solved, but a precedent will be created. If we also start applying something similar to other situations, we are undertaking in the future to have centralised unitary legislation such as does not even exist between the 50 States of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I see drawbacks. But I have many more objections to tackling legal weaknesses and setting precedents in ways that leave social problems permanently unsolved. Because we support the goal that has been set, we are voting for the proposed measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Banotti on her excellent report, which is part of thorough, ongoing work on protecting and guaranteeing children’s rights. As the House knows, the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year. Priority was specifically given in this programme to family disputes, as laid down by the Tampere European Council. The French government’s initiative is the first practical step towards this. I should like to emphasise that, although this report and this subject are being discussed on a Friday morning, I hope that the media, which so often says that European debates have nothing to do with the everyday lives of our citizens, understands that, on this occasion, with this subject, we are addressing an issue that affects not only the life but also the hearts of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In May, we adopted a regulation incorporating the Brussels II Convention into Community law. This regulation simplifies and clarifies rules on defining the competent court and the relevant law for regulating divorces, separations and the allocation of parental control. This French initiative therefore refers to the scope of the Brussels II Regulation and is, if I may put it this way, a revolutionary initiative. I say this because, for the first time, it enshrines the abolition of the <span class="italic">exequatur</span> for the automatic recognition of a judgment by a court in a Member State by the legal system of another Member State. While it is true, however, that it is a great step forward from this point of view, I also share the opinion of Mrs Banotti and other honourable Members that it is deplorable that the scope of this regulation should be limited to the protection of children of marriages that are recognised as such by the law. This fact is bound by the scope of the Brussels II legislation itself. What I therefore wish to tell Parliament is that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters – which we hope will be adopted by the end of this year – the Commission proposes that the first and utmost priority should be given to extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, of this regulation on rights of access, covering both the children of married couples and those of unmarried couples without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the document – as you know, this is not a Commission initiative – I should simply like to make three observations. The first is that we are working together with the Council in order to improve the text, specifically with regard to its most complex issue, which is the delicate balance between the need to guarantee that the child will be returned immediately after the visit, and also the need to safeguard the possibility of guaranteeing protection of the child whenever this should prove necessary. We are addressing a tragic issue here, that of the abduction or improper withholding of children, which is, unfortunately, much more common than we might think. It is difficult to find this balance, but we are convinced that it will be possible, with the help of your amendments and with the climate of dialogue that exists with the Council, to reach a solution that is both technically flawless and, above all, workable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, I wish to emphasise that the Commission has some difficulties with Amendment No 1, tabled by Mrs Banotti, because this is not merely a procedural amendment, but an amendment that takes us into the field of the harmonisation of substantive family law, establishing a lower limit of one day for the exercising of rights of access. I am sure that the intention behind this amendment is valid, but it could have harmful effects if we consider that courts will only grant rights of access when they feel that this must be for a whole day. There are solutions in which the courts grant rights of access for a period of less than a day for reasons to do with the protection of the child itself. I feel that we should lay down an indicative criterion but not a legal obligation, trusting judges who are called on to apply the law to be reasonable enough to guarantee that the rights of access they grant are effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that although this is not the subject of a direct amendment by Mrs Banotti, the Commission has difficulties with the amendment to Article 17 of the regulation proposed by the French Government. We have difficulties with this because we feel that this article places too much emphasis on the purely intergovernmental origins of judicial cooperation. It is worth saying, however, that the issue of civil judicial cooperation was communitised by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Therefore, the functioning of the committee that Article 17 is challenging should not be purely intergovernmental. The Commission should play a more active role, as it does with regard to the European judicial network in civil matters, an issue which has, in fact, been submitted for the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I am convinced that, with the adoption of this regulation that has a limited range but which is of symbolic value and important practical application, I am convinced, I repeat, that we are taking an initial, important step towards bringing the European Union closer to the citizens, particularly those citizens who, because of the circumstances of their lives, have had the misfortune to experience the tragedy of separation or divorce, which is always a tragedy, but which should certainly not have repercussions for every child’s right to happiness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point about the one day clearly refers to people who often travel right across the world to see a child. There is a problem in a situation like that, if they are only allowed twenty minutes access to the child. I think if there is a fear of abduction this can be handled by having supervised visitation. I feel very strongly that we have to in some way ensure that the rights of these parents, of whom there are quite a lot, are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I ask for clarification on your point about Article 17. Are you referring in that situation to the involvement of the Secretariat of The Hague Convention in the monitoring of this legislation?
