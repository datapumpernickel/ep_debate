We are not opposing the association agreement; we are just calling for its adoption to be deferred because association agreements, in particular, contain a very tough human rights clause. Thus far, the Commission and the Council have never, and I repeat, never, attempted to use cooperation or association agreements to secure respect for human rights. Ironically, we are being called upon to vote at the precise moment when Egypt is showing a particularly worrying tendency to persecute homosexuals – with a trial in which 26 people were condemned to up to 5 years of solitary confinement – and Catholics. Well then, at this specific time, I do not feel that taking a few extra weeks to endorse, to ratify these association agreements in order to obtain sufficient guarantees from the Council and the Commission, as well as from the Egyptian authorities, would constitute an act of hostility towards Egypt. Quite the contrary, I feel that it would be an act of confidence in their, and our, ability to make human rights an essential, key factor in foreign and cooperation policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now is a unique opportunity to influence the rights of those in Egypt whose human rights are diminished. We need to influence and improve the way Egypt operates in this field. We need to defer to give Egypt, a friend of the EU, time for reflection. Resolutions and words, albeit well-intentioned, seem to achieve little. Here is an opportunity for action. September 11 should have taught us that we must apply the same principles to our friends, as to our enemies. Egypt is a friend. We must give Egypt the time to reflect, because if we diminish the rights of individuals living in those countries, ultimately, we diminish our own human rights.

It shows a complete lack of understanding of the agreement and of Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe. The draft agreement contains 92 articles concerning not only economic and social issues, but also the political dialogue which is important for achieving progress and peace. Negotiations leading up to the agreement have taken over seven years and have been conducted in difficult circumstances. Those who are calling for an adjournment have clearly not thought about the consequences, especially given the current state of world affairs. Need I remind you that, unlike certain other Arab countries, Egypt has never been a breeding ground for terrorists? On the contrary, Egypt has paid dearly for terrorism. It would be irresponsible not to adopt this agreement. It is unrealistic to expect Egypt to copy our models exactly. It is unrealistic to expect to be able to impose our law. It is unrealistic not to take account of the culture, identity and sovereignty of Egypt. The Member States and we, ourselves, must ratify this agreement. We owe it to the European Union because this agreement will be an essential factor in the necessary relaunch of the Barcelona process. We owe it also to Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe, acknowledged for its role in working for peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, Hugues (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased and honoured to have been appointed rapporteur for the association agreement between the European Union, the Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt, given the importance of this agreement for both the European Union and Egypt. I believe it is a balanced agreement which treats both parties in an equitable way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arab Republic of Egypt is the largest Arab country in terms of population: it has over 66 million inhabitants. It occupies a pivotal position in terms of geopolitical affairs and plays a leading role. Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Since that time, it has continued to have a moderating influence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and Egypt go back a long way. The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1972. We must remember that the European Union is Egypt’s most important trading partner. Egypt also receives significant funds from cooperation with the European Union: it received EUR 686 million through the MEDA I programme between 1996 and 1999. The report we are discussing today has been called a new generation report. Its fundamental objective is to help achieve peace and security in the region. It also aims to provide an impetus for the development of commercial and economic relations between Egypt and the European Union, and between Egypt and its Mediterranean partners. The draft agreement is based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights. The main objectives of the agreement are as follows. Firstly, the establishment of an area of free trade between Egypt and the European Union. This will entail the abolition of customs tariffs on industrial products within a period of 12 to 15 years after the agreement enters into force. Secondly, regional cooperation, including the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of free trade. Thirdly, it establishes the basis for economic and financial cooperation in many areas, including the fight against terrorism. Lastly, an in-depth dialogue on social issues and cooperation as regards the prevention and control of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that this proposal has received the unanimous support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This shows the interest the report has generated. It has also allowed people to express their concerns and fears; some of these are well founded, others less so. I would like to outline two of the concerns put forward. Firstly, there is the problem of the Coptic minority. Coptic Christians represent more than 10% of the population. It appears that, while they are not systematically persecuted, they do not have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow Muslim citizens. It is also clear that extremists are to blame for some of the problems as they do everything they can to exacerbate tension between the two religious groups. However, some progress has been made, as confirmed by the Coptic religious leaders. One example is the recent construction of new monasteries and churches, despite the red tape involved. Secondly, certain individuals and groups have been brought before the courts. This has been highly publicised in Egypt and elsewhere. We need to look beyond the initial verdicts. The local court judges are sometimes influenced by fundamentalist teaching and hand down harsh sentences. But, in some instances, higher courts overturn these initial verdicts and act more leniently, in accordance with democratic principles. I am aware that a lot of work still remains to be done on the issues of fairness and justice, but clearly some progress has been made. The leaders from the opposition and from NGOs, who I have met with in the country, confirm this.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has raised a number of more general concerns. I share some of these, but I must caution those who very willingly step forward to preach to us and to give eulogies on human rights. They should be aware of the need to put their own house in order. It is all too easy for the Egyptians to remind us of our own deficiencies, and they are right to do this. We are open to criticism for having been so lax on a number of issues, particularly as regards the fight against terrorism. We have been reminded that our Member States provide terrorists and murderers, including some Egyptians, with a safe haven where they can live and act with impunity. We must be on our guard. Many Egyptians, including some in important positions, do not wish this agreement to be ratified. They insist that the agreement strongly favours the European Union, especially as regards economic issues, and that it will allow random intrusions into the internal affairs of the State. The recent letter from the People’s Assembly on this matter is inopportune but significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, I hope that the great majority of Parliament will vote in favour of ratifying this agreement. It is to be hoped that the agreement will strengthen the role of the European Union in this region and will contribute towards achieving peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This meeting was arranged following the completion of our fact-finding mission, which took us from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Ramallah. Our mission enabled us to gain a much better understanding of the gravity of the situation. It also made us more aware of the way in which the European Union is acting as a mediator in the region, thanks to the unstinting efforts of Ambassador Moratinos and his team. The importance of his work cannot be stressed highly enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided to hold this meeting because we appreciate the importance of the role Egypt has played in this part of the Middle East. We recall the courageous decisions taken by President Sadat and how he paid for them with his life. At present, President Moubarak is acting with equal courage and risking his own life. Both men have worked steadfastly in helping to get the peace process moving. Sadly, the latter is, today, at a standstill. We were struck by the pertinence of how our Egyptian friends assessed the situation; and this came home to me at the time of the dreadful events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Three weeks ago, I was given the honour of chairing the committee drafting the final declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum. This was an extraordinary session convened by the President of the European Parliament in order to tackle the new crisis and to reinvigorate the Barcelona process. It was thanks to the contribution of the Egyptian representative, amongst others, that this forum was able to adopt a statement. One of the things this document calls for is for the relaunch of the dialogue between the peoples living on both shores of the Mediterranean on our different cultures and religions. This would help us to gain a better understanding of each other. The dialogue should not be pursued merely in a spirit of tolerance. We tolerate only those things we find difficult to accept. Rather, it should take place in an atmosphere of genuine mutual respect in which we accept and benefit from our differences.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I particularly welcome the excellent report by Mr Hughes Martin. It is indeed in the interest of both the European Union and of Egypt to formalise their association by signing the agreement the Council has put to us. It would be completely irresponsible for the European Parliament to delay the signing in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like those Members who are overzealous in defending human rights to consider the impression the West, in general, and the European Union, in particular, give when they preach, sometimes opportunely and sometimes inopportunely, to their partner Arab and African countries. They should realise that they sometimes have just as much to learn about the issue as they have to teach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A short time ago we voted for a deferral of this report and I think anyone who really wants to address the question of human rights in Egypt must vote in favour of this report. This report gives us, the European Union, the ability to take up this matter because we have this human rights clause in Article 2.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is really interested in peace in the Middle East must support this report in any case because it strengthens a country that has been fighting for peace in the Middle East for years. I cannot understand why honourable Members who voted unanimously in favour of this report a week ago in committee now have reservations. Nothing in Egypt has changed, I do not know where anything has changed that would make anybody take a different stance now than the one we took in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise one final point, that is the letter that the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament has written to us. I would like to say that it is unusual to try to influence a decision in this way, an absolutely independent decision of a parliament, and for this reason I shall tomorrow be tabling an oral amendment on behalf of my group, as already arranged with the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly so if the agreement is being signed with Egypt, which is such an important country. We know and believe it can play a leading role in North-South and South-South dialogue, and be in the forefront of economic and commercial development.</p>
<p class="contents">As General Morillon stated, we also believe that Egypt is ready to take the lead in all issues relating to cultural dialogue and civil society, not just in economic and financial matters, and that it is in a position to do so. Furthermore, Egypt’s key role as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict is patently obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, substantiated cases of infringement of fundamental human rights and freedoms, such as those referred to today, give cause for particular concern. Article 2 cannot therefore be simply a political clause. It has to have tangible value. It is important for those countries to progress along the road to democracy. We believe the Egyptian government should take this fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one point clear to Mr Sakellariou. Nobody has raised the possibility of voting against this report. The previous vote was not for or against this report. As I see it, sounding a note of caution simply amounts to giving Egypt the importance due to it as a country. It does not mean penalising it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union attaches great importance to the chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms. We should only sign this agreement on condition that these rights will be respected strictly. Since 1981, Egypt has been subject to an emergency law granting wide powers to the authorities, to the detriment of human rights and democratic freedoms. Today, these so-called freedoms are regulated and are subject to strict control by the authorities. The valuable work undertaken by NGOs has alerted us to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the government of Egypt to repeal this emergency law, so men and women can enjoy all their rights. This would mean that people would not be criminalised on the grounds of their sexual orientation, their religion or their opinion. We will not remain silent on the decision to take legal action against homosexuals, which constitutes a violation of human rights which goes completely against the values we hold dear. We must not interfere, we must not claim that our values are superior, we must not preach but we must denounce and condemn. Human rights are universal and transcend all borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My reservations mainly revolve around the unequal and unsafe social position which Egyptian Christians find themselves in. The oral question to the Commission underlines this anxiety. How does it intend to persuade the Egyptian authorities to improve the situation of the Coptic community? Bear in mind that at least six million Egyptian citizens are involved. It is therefore extremely regrettable that precisely the violation of their fundamental constitutional rights is not explicitly mentioned in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of illustration, I should like to quote three serious instances of abuse with which Egyptian Christians are weighed down: not only do the Egyptian authorities veto the construction of new churches, they also take part in the criminal persecution of Muslims who want to convert to Christianity. The latter is done under the veiled indictment of subversive activities. Thirdly, there is legal uncertainty among the Christian community in Upper Egypt: it is exposed to downright religious persecution by Muslim extremists. Such a vacuum in authority is not acceptable and cannot be solved by combining the arrest of Islamists with the random rounding up of a number of indigenous Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to put these abuses on the agenda during the consultation with the Egyptian authorities. They are duty-bound to do this on account of the content of this association agreement. The positive element, namely that since 11 September, the Coptic churches have been having talks with the Egyptian authority, reinforces this essential provision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not trying to play the high-handed human rights idealists who are against <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> and<span class="bold"> </span>interests. Quite the opposite, rapporteur: I feel that we are just a little more realistic in our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that seven years have already passed, as you have said, deciding to wait maybe another month or two to give ourselves the time to find a response to specific issues before implementing an agreement which, I am glad to say, is irreversible on many points, is, I feel, being realistic. Attempting to pursue the issue of human rights with empty, worthless declarations of which we have made thousands in the past and will make thousands more in the future, depriving ourselves of a practical pressure lever at precisely the moment when we could be getting down to the nitty-gritty is, I feel, being unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">What we requested is that, for once, the European Commission and the European Union should view the issue of human rights as something which needs to be given practical expression in relationships where we have bargaining power with other countries too. We know that there is a human rights clause, we know that this clause could, theoretically, encourage respect for human rights in Egypt and maybe even increase comprehension of a country such as Egypt in Europe. The problem is that the upholding of human rights, the possibility of making a direct impact, of putting tangible pressure on the human rights situation, is a policy which is not part of the European Commission’s strategy. It is a policy which has no practical expression whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">We have endeavoured, in our proposal, to be just that little bit more realistic than you. You do not have time to wait? No problem. I am all for the association agreements, I am all for free trade and I am all for Egypt! However, it will not be easy to further the cause of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, correspondence with the President of the People's Assembly of Egypt and the Ambassador in Brussels only seemed to underline Egypt's complacency on this matter and eagerness to fudge and gloss over the issues.</p>

Egypt, as a number of speakers have said, plays a significant role in supporting the Middle East peace process and the point that the honourable and gallant gentleman General Morillon made about the sacrifices that some have made in supporting that peace process is entirely correct.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also delighted that Egypt supports a more substantial involvement by the European Union in the Middle East peace process. It is also very active in other regional issues, notably in promoting a resolution of the civil war in the Sudan, in promoting regional free trade through initiatives like the Agadir process which also involves, of course, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and COMESA. We are also grateful for what Egypt does in helping to consolidate the support of the Arab world for the campaign against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say I am relieved at the way the vote turned out a few moments ago given that we pressed Egypt so hard to conclude the negotiations on the association agreement. I can remember standing in this Chamber and being asked what I was doing to press the Egyptians to come to an early agreement for the negotiations. So it has been a rather unusual experience for me today to find a deferral being urged.</p>
<p class="contents">The association agreement was a long time in negotiation but its signature marked an important new stage in Europe's relations with Egypt. The 1978 Cooperation Agreement served its purpose very well but the European Union and Egypt have changed beyond recognition and a new agreement was necessary to underpin what has become an altogether more mature relationship. The Agreement responds to the enormous interests, both economic and political, both bilateral and regional, that the European Union and Egypt have in common and the result of the negotiations is good for both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good for Egypt because it will help the Egyptian economy to face the challenge of globalisation more successfully and more competitively and to carry through reforms within the context of a privileged economic and political relationship with us. It is good for the European Union because it will give a new depth and quality to our relationship with this key political and economic partner and, in addition, the agreement is good for the Barcelona process. With this agreement the infrastructure of association agreements which underpins it is now largely in place and I hope that we will make good progress shortly with Algeria, the Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a critical mass of agreements to allow other Barcelona initiatives to flourish. Let me just refer again to the free trade area which is proposed between the countries which signed that agreement in Agadir.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now look beyond the negotiation of the agreement into the need for prompt ratification and adequate implementation and I want to underline the point about ratification. It is more than a shame that the agreement with Jordan, for example, has still not been ratified by all the Member States and we need to encourage people to get on with the ratification of these agreements rather more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously welcome the excellent report which has been drafted by the honourable gentleman Mr Martin. It is a very professional piece of work and we are grateful for that and the support for the rapid ratification of the agreement by Parliament. It is in everyone's interest that all the provisions of the agreement enter into force very quickly and I hope that the ratification process in this case proceeds expeditiously. This will be an important procedural step but also a very positive and encouraging signal to the Egyptian and Member State parliaments. Certainly, the procedural delays in the ratification process by some Member States are often incomprehensible to our Mediterranean partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the concern of certain parliamentarians that our agreements with Mediterranean partners give insufficient stress to interparliamentary relations. Existing practice indicates that Parliament will not hesitate to develop increasing close contacts with its Egyptian counterpart but, in addition, let me stress that interparliamentary relations are well covered in the relevant texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noticed the European Parliament's concern, which I understand, at the state of civil, religious and political rights in Egypt. I can assure Members that I have not hesitated to discuss these matters regularly with my Egyptian counterparts. All aspects of the European Union's relationship with Egypt, including the respect for human rights, are continuously monitored by the Commission which is vigilant on human rights issues irrespective of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of the new agreement provide both sides with important safeguards and a valuable additional forum. When the agreement comes into force we will be able to raise, and hopefully resolve, any major issue at the appropriate association council or committee. I just make the point – very gently to honourable ladies and gentlemen who might not agree with this point and who came in a flurry of enthusiasm earlier to vote against going ahead with the ratification of this agreement – that this agreement gives us a much better forum for discussing with the Egyptians exactly the issues which they raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual cases including alleged restrictions on the Coptic community are taken up from time to time by the Commission. We collaborate closely with Member States in taking positions on these issues and I hope that Parliament will have noted that we never hesitate to make our views known to the Egyptian authorities. I note that, as far as the inordinately light sentences on those accused of instigating murderous riots against Christians in Upper Egypt were concerned, the Court of Appeal in Egypt has ordered a retrial.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently, the Commission delegation has explained the contractual basis of grants to non-governmental organisations in the context of the Saad Ibrahim appeal which I have discussed in the past with my Egyptian counterparts. We have joined with Member States in expressing our concern to the Egyptian authorities at the outcome of the recent trial of homosexuals and I understand the concerns that have been expressed by honourable Members about their case. But we should also note encouraging developments, the new social legislation on the rights of women, the supervision of elections by the courts and the important rulings by courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for good and fluid European relations with Egypt can seldom have been more important. In the last few weeks everybody has been talking about the vital importance of trying to demonstrate to the Arab and Islamic world that the campaign against terrorism is not the West setting Europe and the United States against the world of Islam. Everybody sensible has made the point that it is, at the least, unwise for us to lecture the Islamic world as though we had a monopoly of virtue. Everybody has talked about the importance of deepening the dialogue with the Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an agreement which gives us the chance of putting in place a foundation stone for our relations with the countries around the Mediterranean. The idea that you could have a serious policy on the Mediterranean without having an agreement with Egypt is "for the birds", as the Americans say. We obviously have to take up human rights...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by Mr Cashman)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I respect the honourable Member but think he will do me the credit of knowing that I do not have to take lectures on human rights from anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to pursue our dialogue on human rights with Egypt and other countries in the Barcelona process but it would be bizarre to argue that Europe should have a serious constructive policy in the Mediterranean and that it should have a deep and profound dialogue with Islamic countries and at the same time reject an association agreement with Egypt. So I hope that Parliament will continue to take its cue from the excellent report widely commended by all Members prepared by Mr Martin. I hope that Parliament will continue to be vigilant about civil, political and social rights in Egypt but will also continue to work hard for a stronger relationship between the European Union and the people in government in Egypt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
