<p>On 2 July, speaking on behalf of the Italian Presidency, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi admitted in the European Parliament that the members of the Euro zone no longer had any financial and monetary means of combating recessions and that instead there was a need for ‘European measures’, an active European financial policy and measures by the European Investment Bank. The Council’s new President also called for a relaxation of the EMU Stability and Growth Pact for the euro.</p>
<p>What is the Council’s view of the proposal made in June/July by France’s Defence Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie, partly with the support of her German counterpart Peter Struck, that purchases of armaments should be regarded not as expenditure but as investment, so that they would have no bearing on the balanced-budget requirement, and the suggestion by Italy’s Minister for European Affairs, Rocco Buttiglione, that research funding should be treated in the same way?

<p>(IT) The Stability and Growth Pact provides for assessment of Member States' general government budgetary positions, as set out in the national accounts. Detailed provisions for the establishment of the national accounts, including the concept of 'general government', are laid down in Council Regulation No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European System of National and Regional Accounts in the Community (commonly referred to as ESA 95).</p>
<p>The established figures for 'general government' budgetary positions include both defence and research expenditure, so these are taken into account when considering national budgetary positions in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Council has not discussed any proposal to alter ESA 95 definitions for the purposes of surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>In respect of the content of public expenditure programmes, the Council has always emphasised the importance of the quality of public expenditure when assessing Member States' annual Stability and Convergence Programmes in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. This was reflected in the ECOFIN Council's report to the Spring 2003 European Council on 'Strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies', which was endorsed by the European Council. This was the most recent discussion in ECOFIN of the budgetary coordination framework and concluded unequivocally that 'there is no need to change either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact, nor to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules'. The report did, however, note that 'greater attention should be paid, within the overall constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, to the quality of public finances with a view to raising the growth potential of the EU economies in conformity with the Lisbon agenda'. Thus the quality of public finances and their contribution to raising potential growth will be assessed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact without any change to the parameters of the Pact itself.</p>
<p>The 'European measures' which might be envisaged to promote growth are presented both by the Italian Presidency in its 'European Action for Growth' and by the Commission in its 'Initiative for Growth'.</p>
<p>How the EIB might contribute is described in the EIB's Memorandum to the ECOFIN Council: 'The EIB's role in promoting long-term growth through investment in TENs and major R&amp;D projects'. All three of these documents were discussed by the ECOFIN Council on 15 July, at which it adopted Conclusions giving a mandate to the Economic and Financial Committee for further work. Those Conclusions clearly note that further discussion of the issue is expected at the ECOFIN Council and the European Council in October, then at the ECOFIN Council in November and the European Council in December. Other Council formations will pursue work on the particular aspects of concern to them in order to inform discussions at the European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0453"></a>

<p>According to the information available at the time of writing, the Spanish citizen Ana Isabel Sánchez Torralba was murdered yesterday in Equatorial Guinea by means of gunshots fired by local military personnel at the coach in which she was travelling through the mainland part of the country. She had travelled to Guinea (together with various companions) in order to work for Misioneras Escolapias. This is a brutal act which has cost a young Spaniard her life and which was committed by people who, in a premeditated, unjustifiable and criminal fashion, opened fire on a civilian vehicle which had just passed a military checkpoint. Such a deed illustrates the behaviour of representatives of the forces of order who are accustomed to attacking and mistreating members of the general public. What information is the Council to seek? How does it intend to protest? How will it insist that justice is done in the case of the murder of a European citizen?

<p>(IT) The Council does not have information on the alleged murder of the Spanish citizen Ana Isabel Sánchez Torralba in Equatorial Guinea and in these circumstances it is not in a position to identify specific steps that could be undertaken. The Council is of the opinion that the problem of violence and crimes should be addressed in general terms and not only in relation to EU citizens.</p>
<p>The EU is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the internal political situation in Equatorial Guinea with regard to the human rights record and the democratisation process. Following last year's elections (December 2002) the EU expressed its concern over the political development in the country and in particular on the increased human rights violations. The EU urged the government and the political opposition to hold an all-inclusive political dialogue on the process towards democratisation and on establishing guarantees for the respect of human rights. It will continue to do so and in any case to purchase any action within its contracts with the relevant authorities to prevent and clear up dramatic situation as the one referred to by the Honourable Parliamentarian in his question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0455"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council would like to remind the Honourable Member that the decision taken by the Council on 2 May 2002 to include the 'Mujahedin-e-Khalq' in the EU list of persons and groups involved in terrorist acts was based on a detailed and in-depth examination of available information fully complying with the criteria laid down in Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001. These criteria were set out to ensure that all cases comply with the fundamental principles and procedures of the rule of law and respect human rights.</p>
<p>The Council would like to clarify once again that the inclusion in the list of a person or group is subject to a prior decision taken by a competent authority. The competent authorities in question are those addressed in Article 1(4) of the above mentioned Common Position.</p>
<p>In connection with the raid undertaken on 17 June 2003 by the French authorities against the MKO, the Council is not aware of any decision by the French judiciary stating whether or not the MKO is a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>As regards the Argentine judiciary's decision to issue a series of international arrest warrants against officials of the Iranian regime, the Council has not taken a position on this matter.</p>
<p>The EU is currently negotiating with the Iranian authorities a Trade and Co-operation agreement and, in parallel, an agreement on political dialogue and co-operation on counter-terrorism. The Council has underlined that all these agreements form an indissociable whole as regards their entry into force, application and denunciation.</p>
<p>The EU also takes advantage of all political dialogue meetings with Iran to press for further progress in democratic reforms. In this regard, a specific dialogue on Human Rights has been set up with Iran; two meetings have already taken place and a third one is scheduled for September.</p>
<p>The EU has always made clear in its dialogue with all third countries that fighting terrorism must be done in full respect of human rights and the rule of law, and that it must by no means serve as a pretext to enforce or maintain restrictions on fundamental freedoms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Provisions on employee information and consultation are contained in Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees <a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies <a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses <a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

<p>(IT) The honourable Member is no doubt aware of the long-term nature of developing the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the interests of sustainability. It should be noted that the Community has funded research on hydrogen and fuel cells since the 1970s and this funding has been substantially increased within the current sixth framework programme as compared to its predecessor. Given the size of the task of developing the hydrogen economy, international co-operation is considered to be necessary, indeed vital, to achieving progress. The recent agreement with the US should be seen against this background; it results in fact, from an amendment to an existing implementing agreement between the Commission and the US Department of Energy (DOE)<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will also be aware that implementation of the Science and Technology agreement concluded between The European Community and the Government of the United States of America in 1998 falls under the responsibility of the Commission; the Council has no direct involvement in its implementation.</p>
<p>The Council, therefore, has no specific tasks in formulating the timetable and action plan relating to the 'International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy', which is a US initiative, and which is being developed during the course of 2003. It will, of course, as part of the long-term policy development in energy and research matters follow progress very closely.</p>
<p>For more detailed information regarding the timetable and action plan relating to the 'International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy', the honourable Member is advised to take up these questions with the competent authorities.</p>
<p>There are, for the moment, various means for fostering public-private collaboration on research and development, the most obvious one being the implementation of the sixth framework programme within the context of the European Research Area. Various recent initiatives for increasing investment in R&amp;D to reach the 3% GDP objective have underlined the importance of this collaboration<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the content of which could be better detailed by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member is aware, there is an increasing number of products marketed in the Community and presented as supplementing the intake of nutrients from the normal diet.</p>
<p>The preamble to Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to food supplements notes that those products were regulated in Member States by differing national rules that may impede their free movement, create unequal conditions of competition, and thus have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market. It was therefore necessary to adopt Community rules on those products marketed as foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The other important objective of this Directive was to ensure the products on the market are subject to maximum safe levels, in order to avoid excessive intakes which may result in adverse effects, and bear adequate and appropriate labelling, in order to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers and facilitate their choice.</p>
<p>As a first stage, this Directive lays down specific rules for a certain number of nutrients used as ingredients of food supplements. Specific rules concerning other nutrients or substances with a nutritional or physiological effect used as ingredients of food supplements will be studied at a later stage, provided that adequate and appropriate scientific data about them become available. Until such specific Community rules are adopted, national rules concerning them will remain applicable.</p>
<p>The maximum amounts of nutrients listed in the annexes to the Directive and present in food supplements per daily portion of consumption as recommended by the manufacturer have not yet been set, taking notably into account the upper safe levels of nutrients established by scientific risk assessment and the intake of nutrients from other dietary sources. Thus, a revision at this stage seems premature.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recently published a report entitled 'Analysis of the island regions and outermost regions of the European Union'<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which shows that island regions of EU Member States lag significantly behind mainland regions of the Union both as regards per capita income and the rate of development and other structural features (access to services, education, health, economic structures, the environment, presence of public bodies, etc.).

<p>On the basis of the above, will the Council say whether it intends to take initiatives to produce a more effective cohesion policy for island regions of the Union? Does it intend to propose that the Commission take measures to support the most disadvantaged island regions of the EU on the basis of the latest comparative and qualitative data at its disposal?

<p>(IT) The Council reminds the honourable Member that, in order to promote the harmonious development of the Community as a whole, the Community is developing and pursuing its measures, pursuant to Article 158 of the EC Treaty, seeking, in particular, to close the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and to reduce the amount by which the less favoured and island regions, including rural areas, are lagging behind.</p>
<p>For the regions referred to in Article 299(2), the Treaty also considers island status as one of the factors whose effects can combine, in the long-term, to stunt development severely.</p>
<p>With regard to the report drawn up at the initiative of the Commission, which contains an analysis of the island and outermost regions of the European Union, the document, which states that the 286 island regions are spread over 11 Member States of the European Union, also notes that over 75% of the islands identified are concentrated within the territory of five Member States and that, with some exceptions, their economic and social situation is, in general, worse than that of the country to which they belong and, in any case, differs substantially from island to island.</p>
<p>The Council points out that a set of instruments already exists at European Union level which, directly or indirectly, provide a response or contribution to the situation of island regions.</p>
<p>We would mention, by way of example, the funding granted to islands entitled to it under the Cohesion Fund, the more flexible competition rules applying to island regions and the Union programmes which, although not key programmes for island regions as such, have, nonetheless, proved to be positive for emerging sectors such as the promotion of renewable energy, programmes relating to the information society, telemedicine projects, the LIFE programme and programmes in the field of employment – giving a greater local dimension.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is too early for the Council to be able to provide any information on the holding of the final negotiations to be launched on the Structural Funds after 2006.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Italian Presidency has stipulated in its programme that the cohesion policies must remain a fundamental pillar of Community integration. The reform of the solidarity policies and the drawing up of the new programme for the enlarged Union for the period 2007-2013 will be based on the practical information the Commission provides in its third report.</p>
<p>However, the Council would remind the honourable Member that any measure or initiative similar to that described in his speech adopted before the general revision of the current framework is subject to the submission of a Commission proposal. The Council has not received any proposal to that effect.</p>
<p>As regards the Intergovernmental Conference, work will be organised and carried out in accordance with the relevant rules laid down in the Treaty. The Council will take note of the results in due time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council is well aware of the Resolution on preparations for the 5th<span class="sup"> </span>World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference (Cancún, Mexico, 10-14 September 2003), which the European Parliament adopted on 3 July 2003.</p>
<p>The Council has equally taken note of and discussed at preparatory levels the statement, which Commissioner Pascal Lamy delivered before the European Parliament on 18 June 2003 on the future of the textile and clothing sector in view of the WTO negotiations. The year 2005 is a double target date for the textile and clothing sector: by then, the Doha Round has to be concluded and by then as well, all quantitative restrictions or quotas will have to be lifted. So, 31 December 2004 marks the end of the ongoing WTO general trade negotiations and the end of four decades of managed trade in the textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p>In general, concerning the textile and clothing sector, our common commercial policy has as a matter of fact always been based on the request of reciprocity during negotiations with third parties, as outlined in the general mandate adopted by Council on 9 November 2000 and as most recently achieved in the new textiles and clothing trade agreement with Vietnam, adopted by Council on 2 June 2003.</p>
<p>It must be said however that the negotiations in the Doha Round are based on the corresponding Ministerial Declaration which asks for the negotiations to 'take fully into account the special needs and interests of developing and least-developed country participants, including through less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments'. The WTO mandate therefore departs somewhat from the principle of complete reciprocity, which has been the constant guideline for the EC so far.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council can assure the honourable Member that it shares the positions expressed by the European Parliament and by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0497"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council Conclusions of 10 December 2002 (doc. 15138/02), mentioned inter alia the need to 'consider the possibility of a limited strategy or guidelines for concrete EU action, e.g. in the field of (…) children and armed conflict, as an alternative to a comprehensive EU strategy'. The Council Working Party on Human Rights is to consider such a limited strategy or guidelines during the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Council seeks to reinforce international action in all appropriate fora to promote the rights and the protection of children, to ensure the rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict and against recruiting and using children in armed conflict. To this end, the EU supports in particular the work of the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, and recognizes the importance of the work carried out by the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNIFEM, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>The EU welcomed the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in February 2002. This year, like in previous years, the EU successfully tabled a resolution (2003/86) on the rights of the child at the UN Commission on Human Rights, which calls for the protection of children affected by armed conflict (paragraphs 38-43).</p>
<p>The EU also welcomed the adoption of UNSC resolution 1460 (2003) of 30 January 2003 and the undertaking by the Security Council to give special attention to the protection, welfare and rights of children in armed conflict when taking action aimed at maintaining peace and security, including provisions for the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, as well as the inclusion of child protection advisers in these operations. In this context, the Council adopted conclusions on the protection of civilians in EU-led operations at its meeting on 21 July 2003. The Council, in particular through work by the Committee on Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management, will further develop appropriate instruments to ensure effective implementation of those conclusions in EU-led Crisis Management Operation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0501"></a>

<p>(EN) Before replying to the question of the honourable Member in more detail, the Commission would like to ask attention for the fact that it supports the incomes of the sheep farmer through a Common Market Organisation. There is no specific scheme at Community level to support the wool sector, and the Commission does not have plans to set up such a scheme in the foreseeable future. However, there are certain possibilities for support in this sector.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to mention the rural development programmes, and more specifically the LEADER+ initiative, which have financed some projects concerning wool. The structural funds have also supported regional development projects of which the wool sector has been a beneficiary.</p>
<p>Concerning young farmers, with the common agriculture policy (CAP) reform agreed by the Council of Agriculture in June 2003, three new provisions in the Rural Development Regulation 1257/99 are to be introduced, which benefit young farmers:</p>
<p>Firstly, a new recital that establishes that young farmers should be considered a priority;</p>
<p>Secondly, an increase by 5 percentage points in maximum public support for investments in agricultural holdings. This means actually an increase from 45% to 50% in the non-less favoured areas and from 55% to 60% in less favoured areas, and</p>
<p>Thirdly, a higher support for the setting-up of young farmers, who are using farm advisory services linked to the setting-up, in this case the maximum premium increases from € 25 000 to € 30 000.</p>
<p>Once the legal texts of the CAP reform are adopted, Member States can make use of these new possibilities and adapt their rural development programmes. If there are young farmers who see opportunities in the wool sector and intend to set up a business and invest in it, these new provisions can of course benefit them. However, it is the young farmer as a market player who has to take these decisions based on the assessment of the business opportunities he/she sees.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0464"></a>

<p>(EN) As pointed out by the honourable Member, seaweed represents a valuable asset that can contribute to the socio-economic development of coastal regions either through the harvesting of seaweed growing naturally or through active farming thereof. The former offers few possibilities for development in the Union as wild seaweed is already harvested to its full potential in most Member States. Actually, these Member States have developed complex legislation to make the best of the harvesting of wild seaweed in their near shore areas and to avoid the over exploitation of these sessile marine living resources.</p>
<p>As for seaweed farming, marginal quantities of seaweed are already farmed in the Union and potential for future expansion may exist in a number of Member States, as indicated in the recent Communication from the Commission to the Council and the Parliament 'A Strategy for the Sustainable Development of Aquaculture'<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In this strategic document, the Commission recommends that aquaculture activities should be diversified and that more efforts should be dedicated to research on new species, especially species, such as seaweed, that are able to utilise primary production efficiently. In this respect, Community support has already been provided to at least two research projects aiming at the improvement of seaweed cultivation techniques, one for Laminaria digitata (project AIR3-CT94-2235), the other for the edible red seaweed Palmaria palmata (project FAIR-CT97-3828).</p>
<p>Member States wishing to develop seaweed farming may use European structural funds for this purpose. They may in particular dedicate a significant share of the funds allocated to them through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) to the development of aquaculture and/or to processing or marketing of its products. They may also follow the recommendation from the Commission to allocate greater public support to aquaculture diversification which could provide opportunities for future seaweed farming development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken careful note of the question raised by the honourable Member on the classification of rural areas.</p>
<p>There is no single commonly agreed and internationally recognised definition of rural areas, given their great diversity. The Commission has itself no current plans to propose new objective criteria for the definition of a typology of rural areas.</p>
<p>Preparation of any such typology could only be considered for the preparation of rural development policy post 2006. However, even with this longer term perspective, the Commission is not convinced that a common typology defined at Community level is necessary for the implementation of Community rural development policy, nor that a single common typology could take account of the wide diversity of rural situations which will exist in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p>Under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 it is currently the responsibility of Member States when preparing their rural development programmes to define what they consider to be rural areas, within their specific national and/or regional contexts.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the current flexible framework under which Community rural development policy is implemented, which gives a high degree of subsidiarity to Member States, already provides sufficient scope for those Member States or regions who so wish to target the measures within their programmes on the specific needs of rural areas.</p>
<p>Under the 'Less-favoured area measure and areas with environmental restrictions', specified in Chapter V of Council Regulation 1257/1999 there are well-established Community criteria which result:</p>
<p>a)firstly in a distinction between Less favoured rural areas and other rural areas</p>
<p>b)and in a Community typology of handicaps for Less favoured areas:</p>
<p>Natural handicaps (mountain areas; areas north of the 62nd Parallel treated as mountain areas; areas with specific natural handicaps; areas with environmental restrictions resulting from Community law);</p>
<p>Less favoured areas with socio-economic handicaps in danger of abandonment of land-use.</p>
<p>As indicated in the Commission's replies to the European Community Court of Auditors Special Report n° 4/2003 concerning the support for Less favoured areas the evaluation of the results of the current programmes will provide information on the need for a review of the Less favoured areas classification criteria and on the basis of this information the Commission will consider whether the present system should be changed for the period after 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0508"></a>

<p>(FR) Following the report which the Commission presented to the Council and to Parliament in January 2001 on the working of the common organisation of the markets (COM) in fruit and vegetables and in accordance with the conclusions of the Spanish Presidency following the examination of this report in the Council, there appeared to be an urgent need to simplify the regulations governing fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>This simplification was necessary in order to simplify the life of the market players and increase legal certainty for them, as well as for the Member States, especially if you think about the impending enlargement and the importance, to the future Member States, of an improved acquis.</p>
<p>The Commission started this process back in December 2002 by reviewing the implementing provisions for this COM. The work was therefore carried out within the framework of the management committee, even though the discussion was extended to the main representatives of the sector and numerous suggestions and comments were received by the Commission from national, regional and European professional organisations, from cooperatives and Producers Organisations (PO).</p>
<p>At the management committee meeting held at the beginning of July 2003, the majority of the delegations supported most of the new provisions for this simplification proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that this simplification will help the sector to achieve one of the objectives of the 1996 reform, namely to enable POs to further concentrate the supply of fruit and vegetables. With approximately 30% of production concentrated by the POs on the eve of the reform, the objective set was to achieve 60%. However, this index was still limited to 40% in 2001. According to the Commission, the changes made will make POs better able to respond to the challenges of a highly competitive market and better able to concentrate the supply further, both through transnational POs and associations of POs, which instruments have been strengthened, and through cooperation between different POs, which is widely encouraged by the new rules.</p>
<p>This simplification will also allow the Member States to take better account of the specific practical situations which characterise each of them and with regard to which greater subsidiarity was considered necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The situation in the Northern Caucasus keeps deteriorating, especially with regard to the protection of the 85 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ingushetia and the provision of humanitarian aid. The Commission is, in particular, extremely concerned at the current situation of IDPs, who are under growing pressure to return to Chechnya. The latest declarations made by Chechen, Ingush and Russian authorities, indicating a few weeks ago that there would be no tent camps left in Ingushetia by the end September, have only added to the diverse forms of pressure put on the IDPs to leave Ingushetia. Aid organisations, among which the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), continue to be forbidden from replacing tents in camps or constructing alternative shelter for IDPs who do not want to return to Chechnya as long as insecurity prevails. The 180 rooms in barracks built by Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and funded by ECHO still remain empty to date. These are clear factors which point to an increased vulnerability of IDPs present in Ingushetia and to a degradation in the level of protection they are entitled to. In addition, the security situation has deteriorated as well, with armed forces coming from Chechnya extending their mop-up operations to civilians displaced in spontaneous settlements.</p>
<p>In Chechnya proper, the situation keeps deteriorating and it is very likely that violence and insecurity will only increase as elections are approaching. Severe and widespread violations of human rights continue, in particular abductions of civilians at night, tortures and extra-judiciary executions. The humanitarian situation has not improved either so far and people, particularly in Grozny, keep depending largely on external humanitarian aid for their survival.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, access to Chechnya is still extremely difficult, if not impossible, for humanitarian staff and working there entails great risks for aid workers, as the example of Arjan Erkel, the Head of MSF who was abducted 13 months ago, sadly demonstrates. As the honourable Member knows, all demarches to the Russian authorities about Mr Erkel have led nowhere so far, and the Commission counts on your continued support to help it raise the issue whenever possible until his safe liberation is obtained.</p>
<p>As a result of this high insecurity, most aid agencies work through 'remote control' set-ups and rely to a great extent on the extraordinary work of the local staff.</p>
<p>ECHO will continue to support these organisations and maintain the same level of funding for the victims of the crisis in Chechnya: this year's budget is € 26 million. The Commission, through ECHO, remains the largest donor in the region and has already allocated more than € 93 million since the beginning of the second Chechnya conflict. The main sectors ECHO supports are food, non-food, health, water and sanitation, protection, education and shelter. A majority of ECHO's beneficiaries are women and children.</p>
<p>In order to be closer to these beneficiaries and to have more access to Chechnya, ECHO is still trying to open a sub-office in Nazran, Ingushetia. Unfortunately, this proves very difficult since Russian authorities have refused so far to give permission. The Commission hopes that the Russian authorities will eventually respond positively to its request and that it will reach an agreement with them on this issue.</p>
<p>In view of the deterioration of the situation and the many problems ECHO and its partner organisations face in the delivery of aid, the Commission has repeatedly raised the question with the Russian side on numerous occasions over a longer period and the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Cooperation has personally written twice to the President of Ingushetia to voice his concerns and ask for his support. He hopes this will help facilitating our continued action in favour of the many victims of this terrible crisis.</p>
<p>The situation in Abkhazia has not improved at all from a humanitarian point of view. It has even deteriorated in the last few years, with very little presence of humanitarian organisations. This is why, in view of the extent of the forgotten needs, ECHO has decided in 2002 to renew its support to the most vulnerable populations. ECHO had phased out, like most humanitarian donors, from Abkhazia in 2000, hoping that the situation would improve. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and the absence of a settlement to this frozen conflict has had negative consequences on the economic situation of the region.</p>
<p>ECHO funding for the victims of the Abkhazia conflict, in Abkhazia and in the rest of Western Georgia, amounted to € 1,3 million in 2002 and will amount to € 2,2 million in 2003. This will allow to fund soup kitchens and the distribution of dry food, as well as income and food-generation programmes and food-for-work activities. ECHO will continue to regularly monitor the situation and will have to be engaged as long as humanitarian needs remain.</p>
<p>ECHO is not present in Nagorno-Karabakh but continues to follow the situation and will be ready to intervene, should the situation deteriorate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0489"></a>

<p>EU bodies such as EAR invite NGOs to participate in particular projects with financial backing from the EU. Some NGOs regard the rules on payment procedures as impractical and obstructive, as EU payments are based inter alia on retrospective part-payments in return for submission of receipts. What this means in practice is that NGOs have to advance large sums, which they often lack the resources to do. Moreover, the final payment of the contractual amount is made only after the work has been completed and the costs incurred and approved by means of a special audit. Consequently it is the NGOs rather than the EU body that have to bear the economic risk. The payment procedure also causes major administrative difficulties for those NGOs whose work depends heavily on the use of volunteers.</p>
<p>Has the Commission assessed, or will it assess, whether these payments are equitable and effective vis-à-vis the parties selected by means of a tender procedure?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Payment of subsidies to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from the Union’s general budget comes within the framework of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget, especially Articles 79 to 82 and 117 to 119 (and Articles 97, 99, 104-105 and 180 to 183 of the implementing rules). These provisions require the Commission to ensure that proper use is made of Community funds, mainly by limiting the level of prefinancing and demanding audits and financial guarantees. Provision is made for simplified control procedures for NGOs who sign a framework partnership agreement with the Commission on the basis of article 163 of the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation (implementing procedure for humanitarian aid actions).</p>
<p>The flexibility provided for under the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation is used mainly by the Commission to speed up the procedures for making payments to NGOs.</p>
<p>Thus, the procedures for making payments relating to subsidies within the framework of external actions (including by the European Agency for Reconstruction) benefit NGOs. Prefinancing, which may be as much as 80% of the value of the contract (or of the budget for the first year of multiannual contracts) is paid within 45 days of signing of the contract. This prefinancing is much higher than the Commission average. For multiannual contracts, cumulative prefinancing may be as much as 90% of the value of the contract.</p>
<p>In addition, and in order to speed up payments, payments are made simply on presentation and approval of mid-term or final reports (including audit reports where the amount of the payment so warrants). The substantiating documentation is retained by the beneficiary in case the Commission conducts an ex-post audit.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it cannot make the payment procedures any more flexible without compromising its facility to ensure that actions subsidised are implemented correctly, in accordance with proper financial management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0502"></a>

<p>(EN) All Country Strategy Papers are subject to an intensive review and quality support process prior to approval. This review includes examination of the choice of focal and non-focal sectors selected and allows the Commission to monitor which countries have included health as a priority.</p>
<p>Concentration of aid in a limited number of focal sectors and national ownership are important principles in country strategy programming. Intervention sectors are chosen on the basis of complementarity with other donors and the comparative advantage of the Commission in the country concerned. As a result, while the Commission consistently promotes health as a development objective, health is not always chosen as a focal sector of Community aid.</p>
<p>Seventeen developing countries have identified health as a focal sector in Country Strategy Papers that were finalised by the end of 2002. In national indicative programmes, the level of allocations for health remains low, but Community funds are increasingly devoted to general budget support. One advantage is that, unlike traditional project aid, budget support provides additional funding for recurrent expenditure, which makes up the major part of the health budget. Budget support may also provide extra money for activities outside the health sector which benefit health, for example improving water supplies and sanitation. In African, Caribbean and Pacific countries 24.4% of 9<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund programmable resources amounting to over 1.73 billion € are allocated to general budget support. The Commission’s guidelines on health sector programming and monitoring of indicators aim at ensuring the links between poverty reduction budget support strategies and improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) are developed by national authorities in consultation with all key stakeholders. Where a country has a PRSP, the Commission’s policy is that the Country Strategy should be aligned to it. PRSPs provide a single, comprehensive and costed framework for social development priorities and should deliver increased resources for the social sectors. The Commission recently took part in a consultation to review analytical work on health in PRSPs carried out by the World Health Organisation. This demonstrated that the importance of health is generally well reflected in PRSPs, and they include recognised pro-poor health strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0507"></a>

<p>(EN) This reply is a clarification following to earlier questions debated on 10 April and 3 July 2003.</p>
<p>The basis for Community policy in the field of sexual and reproductive health is the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. In relation to HIV/AIDS, sections 8.28-8.35 emphasise providing information and the promotion of safe and responsible sexual behaviour - including voluntary abstinence and the use of condoms. The Commission would also emphasise the importance of providing information about voluntary counselling and testing for HIV (this is mentioned in ICPD+5).</p>
<p>The Commission position is, therefore, that there should be a comprehensive approach to education about sex and sexuality. Young people should be provided with information and encouraged to think and decide for themselves and act responsibly. Such education should also take into account a strong gender perspective. While abstinence supposes 'safe' behaviour with regard to the transmission of HIV it is necessary to be realistic: it is not always the choice or even an option for those sexually active, in particular for women. And for the Commission to rely on preaching or prescribing abstinence as the only option is simply not responsible. Practical information about protecting oneself, in particular concerning the use of condoms, is therefore vital.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say in percentage terms what the relative part of Community efforts are for delaying the age of first sex and reducing the number of sexual partners. Most Community assistance for population-related activities is un-earmarked support for improved health outcomes or general budget support, but even specific support in this area is not conditional on putting more effort into one or other means of preventing HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The Commission does not make any specific distinction or category for religious or faith based organisations, although such organisations are and will continue to be welcome to apply for Community support through regular calls for proposals.</p>
<p>To give a concrete example, applicants under the latest call for proposals under the thematic Budget Line B7-6311: 'Programme to combat poverty related diseases in the developing countries, fight against HIV/AIDS' needed to be non-profit making and belong to one of the following categories: non-governmental organisations, public-sector operators distinct from the State, local organisations, research or training institutions. The call's objective was to enhance the relevance and usefulness of programmes to fight HIV/AIDS by improving their impact on young people in general, and young women in particular, and by including the poor and populations at risk.</p>
<p>As a result of the evaluation process, six applicants were selected to receive Community support, including civil organisations such as Danchurch and World Vision Netherlands.</p>
<p>As for all other applicants following this call's guidelines, 'Information, education and communication directed towards changing behaviour will be a priority, bearing in mind that the context (social, health, economic and cultural) must make the desired developments possible'. Safe and responsible sexual behaviour may include delaying the age of first intercourse and reducing the number of sexual partners but it may also include other elements such as the use of condoms or other contraceptive supplies.</p>
<p>Information on the calls for proposals, the selection and eligibility criteria and the actions selected are available on the EuropeAid website. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0485"></a>

<p>If the Court of Justice rules that Ireland must report on the above-mentioned issues, Ireland should respect the Court’s ruling.

<p>Implementation of the 'Environment &amp; Health Strategy<a href="#defann_35_3" name="refann_35_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span></p>
<p>The pilot programme is being drawn up in three stages:</p>
<p>In October 2002 a meeting of the so-called 'Helcom Monas'<span class="sup"> 4</span> was held in Warnemünde. The nine Baltic countries were asked to designate experts on the environment, fish and human health and to give the Commission an overview of the different monitoring activities in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>On 5 May 2003 there was an 'Expert Meeting' in Brussels to discuss a number of issues with dioxin experts from the Baltic Region. These issues included an overview of monitoring activities in the different Baltic Countries, a fish monitoring strategy and the links between environment monitoring and health monitoring.</p>
<p>In September 2003 a 'Technical Working Group on integrated dioxin and PCB monitoring in the Baltic Region' will be established in the framework of the 'Environment and Health Strategy'. The first meeting of this Technical Working Group will be held during the Regional Conference in Poland on 6-7 October 2003. By the end of 2003 it will prepare a Baseline Report, including an overview of existing dioxin and PCB monitoring programmes in the Baltic countries, the problems and shortcomings of existing monitoring systems, and requirements for integrated environment and health dioxin and PCB monitoring. During a second phase, the Working Group will by the end of March 2004 establish options for action and recommendations for the Commission’s 'Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010' to be presented as the Community contribution to the Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest in June 2004.</p>
<p>Back in 2001 the Commission proposed a strategy for reducing the presence of dioxins in feed and food, including fish and fishery products as part of the Community Strategy for Dioxins, Furans and Polychlorinated Biphenyls. This strategy, through its integrated approach for reducing the presence of dioxins in feed and food, was to result in a reduction of dioxins levels in fish for human consumption, both wild and farmed.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of suggestions that catching the fish in which dioxins are concentrated would be a way of cleaning these pollutants out of the Baltic environment. Although the Commission would need much more scientific information before it could fully assess the possible effectiveness of such a measure, the information available at present does not indicate that it would be appropriate as part of a general strategy for reducing dioxin levels in the environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the recent meeting of the parties to the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the adoption of the Mexican-led Berlin initiative was a great step forward for the welfare of cetaceans worldwide, in particular through the creation of a new conservation committee within the IWC. Given that many Member States are members of the IWC and in light of the EU's aim to protect and conserve the marine environment in an integrated manner, could the Commission provide a summary of all existing legislation to ensure the protection of whales and dolphins in EU waters and explain how these measures will be coordinated with international action?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) At Community level, all cetacean species are protected under the Habitats Directive,<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the main piece of European legislation aiming at protecting natural habitats and wild fauna. Member States have to take the requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection in order to ensure a favourable status of conservation of cetaceans. Deliberate killing and disturbance of cetaceans as well as the keeping, transporting, sale or exchange of cetaceans or any part of them is banned.</p>
<p>Concerning incidental catches, the Community has, on several occasions, addressed this problem. Community legislation already limits the size of drift nets and has introduced measures to prohibit their use from the start of 2002.<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Commission has recently proposed to regulate this issue in a comprehensive manner, extending the ban on driftnets to the Baltic Sea, using acoustic alarms in certain fisheries and instituting a scheme of on-board observers with a view to monitor by-catch.<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>At international level, the Commission makes every effort to assure that a similar approach is adopted and applied. Thus, when the conservation of cetaceans is discussed within relevant International Conventions and Agreements to which the Community is a party, the position of the Commission is to seek the highest possible level of protection for these species, while respecting the internal procedures established in these international organisms.</p>
<p>Regarding international trade in products obtained from whaling activities, the Community applies the provisions adopted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora, CITES by means of internal regulations<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Furthermore, the Community goes beyond what CITES requires, in order to ensure consistency with the protection of cetaceans as provided for by the Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>And finally, the Commission welcomes the Berlin Initiative on Strengthening the Conservation Agenda of the International Whaling Commission, as decided in its last meeting, that took place this year. The Commission hopes that this new effort from the IWC will contribute to improved conservation of these species.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Achieving the main goal of European integration – increasing the wealth of the member countries by removing current obstacles to the free movement of goods and factors – primarily involves dealing with the tax-policy challenges facing the European internal market. The scenario of a Union which already has 15 and will soon have 25 different tax systems raises the question of what consequences these different European tax systems have for the functioning of the internal market. Can these largely negative consequences for business and consumers be quantified? What steps can the Commission take to remedy the situation, particularly bearing in mind that the principle of unanimity applies in tax matters? EU initiatives in the area of taxation must ensure that tax systems contribute to the efficient operation of the internal market, so that the corresponding framework can be created within which to achieve the objective set in Lisbon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively looking into the question raised by the honourable Member. For instance, the company tax study prepared in 2001 shows that the need for companies to comply with up to fifteen - and soon twenty-five - different sets of corporate tax rules within the Union gives rise to numerous barriers to cross-border economic activity. These prevent us from achieving the full potential economic benefits of the Internal Market. Without action, the Community and its citizens therefore risk foregoing potential growth, employment and welfare. Progress in this field is also crucial in order to achieve the Lisbon goals.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to determine or quantify the precise effects that the co-existence of 15 and soon 25 differing tax systems have on the functioning of the Internal Market. The Commission is launching in September an extensive survey among businesses in the Union on tax-related compliance costs that it hopes will provide some more insight into the dimension of these problems.</p>
<p>Current economic research does not allow detailed quantification of the size of these welfare losses. They certainly exist and they are substantial but putting a firm figure on their size would be too speculative. This is why there was a need to launch various short-term and longer-term initiatives to address the problems.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposed initiatives will take various forms, ranging from 'soft law' and co-ordination to traditional proposals for Directives. As to the prospect of success of the traditional legislative measures, however, it is true that without changing the unanimity principle for decision taking in Union tax matters, it will be extremely difficult to advance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0445"></a>

<p>Can the Commission provide clear additional guidelines on how Article 9 1(a) and 9 1(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) 95/93<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> should be implemented by Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Community law provides for the protection of regional services in two ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Community rules on market access provide for Governments to be able to impose the so-called public service obligations. For routes where a public obligation has been imposed and which are domestic, the Community rules on slot allocation provide that member States may reserve slots at fully coordinated airports (article 9 § 1 (b) of the Regulation). For non-domestic routes, where a public service obligation has been imposed, there is no possibility to reserve slots.</p>
<p>Secondly, for routes, which do not benefit from a public service obligation but connect regional airports on the territory of a Member State with a fully coordinated airport, the rules on slot allocation (article 9 § 1 (a) and § 3 of the Regulation) give Member States the right to reserve slots only under certain conditions. Accordingly, slots for such routes could be reserved, only if</p>
<p>the slots concerned are being used on that route at the time of entry into force of this Regulation;</p>
<p>only one air carrier is operating on the route;</p>
<p>no other mode of transport can provide an adequate service;</p>
<p>the reservation of slots shall end when a second air carrier has established a domestic scheduled service on the route with the same number of frequencies as the first air carrier and operated it for at least a season;</p>
<p>Also, as stated in paragraph 3 of article 9 of that Regulation, the Member State concerned has to communicate to the Commission the list of routes fulfilling the conditions set out in article 9 § (a) and (b) and for which slots have been reserved. This shall first be done at the entry into force of the Regulation, that is 22 February 1993, 30 days after its publication in the Official Journal on 22 January 1993, as provided for in article 15 of the Regulation.</p>
<p>To this date the only Member State, which has applied article 9 §1(a) is France. Today, the following routes are operated in application of article 9 § 1 (a) of the Regulation from the airport of Paris-Orly: Annecy, Avignon, Chambéry, Lannion, Limoges and Metz; a total of 6.894 slots have been reserved at Paris-Orly for these routes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission points out that the sale or retention of emission rights, from a fiscal point of view, will not be determined – at least as regards tax on income, capital and capital gains (derived from the sale of the said rights) – in the same way in the different Member States, given that these taxes are not harmonised at European level. As regards indirect taxation, the sale of emission rights will be construed as a provision of services as defined in the Sixth VAT Directive</p>
<p><a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and will be subject to VAT in all the Member States.</p>
<p>As the Commission has already observed during the amendments to the proposal tabled by Parliament at first reading, the directive cannot create fiscal obligations for the Member States which go beyond its scope. On questions of taxation, the Member States continue to have competence although, as the Court of Justice has stressed on several occasions, the exercise of this competence cannot release them from the obligation to comply with Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, is aware of the material issues raised and of the fact that the lack of coordination between the Member States' tax systems still carries risks of distortion on the internal market (refer, for example, to the answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2002-0028_EN.html">P-0028/02</a><a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>In - partially - accepting another amendment to the draft directive proposed by Parliament, the Commission felt that all the aspects relating to taxation (including capital gains and losses on emission rights bought and sold) were sufficiently interesting to warrant being highlighted in the report on the application of the directive which the Member States are required to submit to the Commission each year. On the basis of these national reports, the Commission will publish a report which may, if necessary, highlight tax problems linked to the application of the directive and the proper working of the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Treaty obliges countries to avoid excessive deficit positions (defined as general government deficit below a reference value of 3 per cent of gross domestic product), and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) requires countries to achieve budget positions ‘close to balance or in surplus’. The concept of ‘general government’ is defined in the Council Regulation N° 2223/96, and the corresponding statistical data are the ones in ESA95. All the expenditures included within the ‘general government’ definition do have a bearing on the ‘close to balance or in surplus’ requirements and on the excessive deficit. Both defence and research expenditure are part of the expenditure of ‘general government’.</p>
<p>The Commission has always, within the respect of the SGP framework, favoured the improvement of the quality of the public expenditure. In its Communication on ‘Strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies’ the Commission proposed to take into account major structural reforms (including tax and investment) in line with the Lisbon Strategy when assessing compliance with the ‘close to balance or in surplus’ requirement.</p>

<p>(FR) The situation in Tibet, including the maintenance and preservation of that country's cultural, linguistic and religious identity, is one of the European Union's priorities in the framework of its overall policy vis-à-vis China.</p>
<p>The communication channels that already exist between Peking and the Union have enabled the latter to bring its concerns in this regard to the Chinese authorities' attention on a very regular basis, be it at sessions of the bilateral Human Rights dialogue or at the very highest political level, during summit meetings.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Union has repeatedly called for direct dialogue to be established between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, which it considers to be the only realistic way of one day finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet. It welcomes the recent re-establishing of contacts during the second visit of the Dalai Lama's envoys to China and would like to see these intensified. It is resolved to continue to support any initiative which might serve to solve the question of Tibet and is acceptable to all the parties concerned within the framework of genuine autonomy for that region.</p>
<p>In the light of these developments, it wonders whether the appointment of an EU Special Envoy for Tibet would in any way enhance the current dialogue mechanism and whether, moreover, it would not be liable to trigger a reaction from China that would compromise the process of reconciliation initiated between the Tibetan representatives and the Chinese authorities and divest the Union of any mediating capacity.</p>
<p>It is also doubtful as to what scope an EU Special Envoy would have for effective action in Tibet. The experience of the US Special Envoy would not appear to be altogether conclusive in this respect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0459"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission has long been of the opinion that the European Union must be developed not only for young people but also with the assistance of young people. That is why it has run action programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo and Youth which are aimed at young people and which enable them to take part in activities at European level in the fields of education, training and youth work. The programmes are already open to young people from the applicant countries in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in European agreements, in the additional protocols thereto and in the decisions taken by the respective Association Councils. From 2004 the programmes will also be open to young people from Turkey.</p>
<p>When in November 2001 the Commission published its White Paper entitled 'A new impetus for European youth', it did so after having conducted a huge consultation exercise involving young people and youth organisations in both the Member States and the applicant countries. In its White Paper the Commission proposed establishing a new youth-cooperation framework based on an open coordination method in which 'applicant countries are associated as far as possible'. This proposal was adopted by the Council in its 27 June 2002 resolution on a cooperation framework for young people (OJ C 168, 13.7.2002).</p>
<p>In that resolution the Commission was instructed to send out questionnaires to the Member States and, on that basis, to propose common objectives for the four priorities identified in the White Paper and adopted by the Council in the resolution. The initial questionnaires sent out were concerned with the topics of participation and information provision. In its analysis of the replies received the Commission took into account the situation and the expectations of the applicant countries to which the questionnaires had also been sent out. The common objectives are currently on the Council table. In addition, many applicant countries consulted their young people and youth organisations before sending in their replies to the Commission. This consultation exercise (which follows on from the one carried out in connection with the White Paper) is an innovative tool preparing the way for enlargement, since it has enabled young people from the applicant countries themselves to become involved in the process of devising a youth policy. In order to increase young people's involvement in the political process the Commission is planning to issue in 2004 a call for proposals for pilot schemes which will encourage active citizenship on the part of young people. That call will be open to youth organisations in the new Member States.</p>
<p>The existing Youth programme will terminate at the end of 2006, for which reason the Commission has conducted a huge consultation exercise with a view to drawing up the next programme covering the 2007-2012 period. It intends to submit at the beginning of 2004 a proposal relating to young people and also to education and vocational training. The proposal will take full account of the needs of young people in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of young people within the employment market and within society as a whole is a major consideration in EU employment strategy and in EU social-inclusion strategy. The applicant countries are working in close cooperation with the Commission in order to prepare themselves for the implementation of those strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0461"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has adopted the Communication on 'Wider Europe' as a framework for developing relations with the countries that will become the Union’s new Eastern and Southern neighbours after enlargement.. In this 'Wider Europe' framework, the Union will work with partners to develop a zone of prosperity and a friendly neighbourhood, with whom the Union enjoys close, peaceful and co-operative relations.</p>
<p>As part of this policy, the Commission will introduce new neighbourhood programmes using the established programmes for cooperation with neighbouring countries - primarily TACIS for the countries of the Community of Independent States (CIS), CARDS for Western Balkans and MEDA for the countries on the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean, combined with INTERREG for the Union side of the programmes. A major theme of the Neighbourhood programmes will be to promote regional and transnational cooperation as well as cross-border cooperation. This will pave the way for introducing a New Neighbourhood Instrument after 2006.</p>
<p>Both Lebanon and Syria will be eligible to benefit from these programmes , once they fulfil the criteria on concluding Association Agreements with the Community and its Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0468"></a>

<p>China has been a member of the WTO since 11 December 2001. Despite this, there are still a number of discriminatory measures (price control policies, totally arbitrary health and certification requirements, obstacles to investment and serious deficiencies in the protection of trademarks) which make a proper commercial relationship between the EU and China on an equal footing difficult. In 2001 China was the world’s leading producer of ceramic floor-tiles, with a 36.4% share of world production and exports of ceramic floor tiles from China grew by 122%.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is in close contact with the Community industry of ceramic tiles, in particular concerning the development of imports of ceramic tiles at low prices from the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>In relation to the steps that the Commission could take in order to provide relief against injurious and/or unfair imports from China, such steps can only be taken within the framework of the existing trade defence instruments, i.e. the anti-dumping, the anti-subsidy and the safeguard regulations (erga omnes safeguard regulation or the product specific safeguard mechanism against Chinese imports provided in Council Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 which implements China's Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organisation).</p>
<p>The application of measures under any of the above-mentioned instruments is subject to international and Community rules. Thus, the initiation of any investigation must be based on prima facie evidence that imports of products of Chinese origin are causing material or serious injury to a Community industry. This analysis is based on the negative development of a certain number of factors, such as market shares, financial performance and employment. The anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruments furthermore require prima facie evidence of dumping (price discrimination or selling under costs of production) or of the provision of State aid to the exporters. If such prima facie evidence is presented to the Commission, the Commission is prepared to initiate an investigation in order to determine whether the conditions for the imposition of measures are met.</p>
<p>So far, the Commission has not received any official request for the initiation of an investigation regarding imports of ceramic tiles from China under any of the above-mentioned trade defence instruments. Needless to say, the Commission is always ready to provide assistance to the Community ceramic industry and Member States for the examination of the merits of a potential complaint under existing trade defence instruments, in particular when small and medium sized are involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the level of individual projects, according to the Directive on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Member States must carry out an environmental assessment.</p>
<p>At the level of programmes, they have to implement the Directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by July 2004. Article 6 of the Habitats Directive requires Member States also to assess plans (and projects) in relation to their impact on Natura 2000 sites. The subject of these regulations are plans and programmes of the Member States including those in the transport sector: for these a strategic environmental assessment should be carried out to protect the environment before the project is planned. The strategic environmental assessment is a contribution to promote sustainable development. This relates to the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> also, which has to be transmitted into national law at the end of 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes to assist the Member States in working out appropriate methods for strategic evaluation and corridor analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission would recall that, in line with the principles of good governance, it is undertaking a detailed impact study of the recommendations of the High Level Group which, under the chairmanship of Mr Van Miert has identified a number of priority TEN-T projects. This study, which will consider the impact on all aspects relating to sustainable development, will be taken into account in the forthcoming adoption of the Commission proposal on revising the TEN-T guidelines in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, Community legislation will only apply in the new Member States from accession onwards. However, the Commission takes the view that they should apply and implement the provisions of the environmental acquis during the pre-accession period. In cases where Community pre-accession funding of large infrastructure developments is involved, 'similar standards' as set by Community environmental legislation need to be applied before any Commission funding is given to the accession countries.</p>
<p>TEN-T funds have not been allocated to the development of the Danube-Oder-Elbe canal and the Regional Fund is not involved in this project, which is not part of the existing TEN-T guidelines and has not been identified by the High Level Group as a priority project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) A distinction needs to be made between three types of loading units:</p>
<p>Containers which comply with ISO standards will continue to move freely in Europe. These containers account for over 91% of the capacity of the world fleet of loading units. However, it should be emphasised that they are not optimised for intermodal transport and logistics in Europe, which means they are ill-suited to and rarely used for intra-European transport.</p>
<p>Containers which do not comply with ISO standards,<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> particularly those over 40 feet long, account for nearly 4% of the said capacity. These containers may continue to be used for sea, river or rail transport, but they do not comply with the maximum dimensions authorised for roads in Europe. They cannot, therefore, be transported by road.</p>
<p>Swap bodies used in Europe account for approximately 2.7% of the capacity of the world fleet of loading units. They are specific to the continent, which explains why they are frequently seen. Unlike the two preceding categories, the majority of swap bodies do not come under the Convention for Safe Containers. They are standardised at European level by the CEN<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, but there are several models which are not standardised. The variety of models causes handling problems during transhipment.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal has three objectives:</p>
<p>To extend controls carried out by the national authorities within the framework of the International Convention on Safe Containers to swap bodies which do not currently come within its scope.</p>
<p>To simplify handling by ensuring that the equipment used to handle containers can be used to handle swap bodies. This is the objective of the project to standardise handling and stowing interfaces for the new intermodal loading units (ILU). The idea is to come into line with the configurations of these interfaces for ISO containers.</p>
<p>The main objective of the proposal for a directive is to launch a European intermodal loading unit (EILU). Use of the EILU will not be compulsory. It will have advantages which will help it to win market shares, because it will be a compromise between the solidity of a container and the capacity of a swap body. In addition, it will be suitable for travel both by sea and waterways and by rail and road. The tasks relating to the finalisation of handling arrangements for the new ILUs and the definition of the EILU will be entrusted to European standardisation organisations (such as the CEN), which will liaise with the ISO. If the CEN can find a technical solution for a unit which respects the guide spacing in cellular container ships, while allowing two front palettes to be loaded, the problem will be resolved. At all events, it is conceivable that EILUs will be able to travel on deck, with the hold reserved for containers. It is a question of opening up for short sea shipping a market in which it currently has no foothold: the swap body market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In many meetings, the development dimension of European Partnership Agreements (EPA) was at the centre of discussions, which has led to increasingly common views on this issue. For example, it was agreed that while EPAs would directly contribute to the development of ACP countries, they would need to be accompanied by appropriate development assistance so as to allow to maximise the benefits. Divergences remain notably on the question of additional resources.</p>
<p>The ACP side and the Commission agreed at the last meeting of ACP Trade Ministers on 31 July 2003 in Brussels, that the dialogue on the all-ACP level will continue when regional negotiations start from October onwards.</p>
<p>The Commission is working with the ACP on a joint report on the first phase for the next joint meeting on EPAs on ministerial level, which is envisaged for 1 October 2003 in Brussels. This event will be followed by the start of negotiations on a regional level with West-Africa and Central-Africa.</p>
<p>Studies and information</p>
<p>In terms of ex-ante assessments of the negotiations, work has advanced in the last months. The support programme of € 20 million for the preparations of EPA negotiations has proven to be a useful source for national and regional impact assessments by the ACP. As a first step, regional impact assessments were carried out for more than € 1,1 million. More recently, studies for 17 ACP countries have been kick started for a total of € 2,4 million. Furthermore, institutional capacity programmes for four countries and three larger regional support programmes for a total of € 600.000 and € 2,5 million, respectively, have been approved. Additionally to the € 20 million programme, more funds will be soon available for trade-related analysis: an all-ACP programme for trade capacity of € 50 million was approved by the European Development Fund (EDF) committee in July 2003 and should be operational by beginning/mid 2004. Regional and national programmes under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF offer considerable resources for negotiation-related analysis and capacity building. In the regional programmes alone, about € 350 million are foreseen for regional integration and trade, including EPA negotiations.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) financed by the Commission will be summarised in a final report, expected for October. Before, the preliminary results will be discussed with civil society in two workshops in W-Africa and the Caribbean, in order to maximise stakeholder inputs and participation. The latest documents of the SIA are accessible on the webpage of the Consultant (.</p>
<p>On the question of transparency and, in particular, communication with the Parliament, both, the Commissioner in charge of Development and Cooperation, and the one in charge of Trade, have been active during the last year to answer questions and to report on the status of negotiations. Status of negotiations was also discussed in a number of meetings with civil society in Brussels, organised by the Commission. Documents regarding the negotiations have been posted on the Directorate General Trade website. Finally, the joint ACP-Commission report on the first phase will be available as soon as agreed, probably beginning of October.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0479"></a>

<p>(EN) While a final decision will be made in the autumn, it seems unlikely that the projects referred to by the honourable Member can be financed. The programme budget was heavily over-subscribed. Consequently, the great majority of applications, including many of very high quality and importance, simply cannot be funded.</p>
<p>The budget for the health determinants part of the new Public Health Action programme is roughly the same as that for the old 'Europe Against Cancer' programme (about €15 million). However, with the same amount, a much vaster range of activities needs to be financed. The cancer projects referred to by the honourable Member would use a budgetary bracket amounting to nearly the entire budget available for a vast field like health determinants. Bearing in mind that the 'Europe Against Cancer' programme has come to an end and that funding possibilities under the new Public Health Action programme for activities covered by the former are much more limited, these networks will need to pursue alternative sources of funding.</p>
<p>Community support for cancer prevention as such does, however, not come to an end; indeed, a number of cancer-related projects are likely to be funded under the present round of financing. These include projects on the establishment of cancer indicators, smoking prevention and smoking cessation, alcohol prevention and on nutrition. These projects should produce sustainable results that will also contribute to cancer prevention, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>As far as developing European guidelines for breast cancer screening is concerned, highly developed instruments are available. Reference is made here in particular to the 'European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening', the 4<span class="sup">th</span> edition of which will be published in 2004. The Commission will analyse carefully the need for any future updating of this document and the possibility of further support that could be given by the Community.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to new developments, such as the Council Recommendation on Cancer Screening, which will be adopted by the Italian Presidency, the 2004 Work Plan of the Public Health Action programme may well include a specific priority area on cancer prevention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0488"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission participated fully in the recent OSPAR<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Ministerial meeting in Bremen referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>As recalled in the ministerial statement at Bremen, the strategy concerning radioactive substances, which was adopted by OSPAR at Sintra in 1998, has the specific objective that by the year 2020 discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive substances are reduced to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels, resulting from such discharges, emissions and losses, are close to zero. The OSPAR commission is assisted in the implementation of this strategy by its Radioactive Substances Committee (RSC).</p>
<p>As the Community is a Contracting Party to the OSPAR Convention, it is represented at OSPAR meetings by the Commission and, as such, is firmly committed to the attainment of the objectives of the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances. The Commission, including the Joint Research Center, is an active participant in the RSC and its various working groups and contributes significantly to the understanding and awareness of the discharge of radioactive substances from all sources into the maritime area..</p>
<p>As part of this contribution, the Commission recently completed a study known as MARINA II, which examined all radioactive discharges and their effects on the OSPAR maritime area. MARINA II, which has been presented to OSPAR, has laid the scientific foundation for building a consensus on the definition of a baseline for radioactive substances against which progress on the implementation of the OSPAR strategy can be measured. Importantly, such consensus on the baseline was also reached at the Bremen ministerial meeting in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has recently outlined, in a communication to the Council and the Parliament, a framework for an Union strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment. Action 10 of that communication provides for a review of the OSPAR process and for consideration of the need for additional Community measures. Taking account of the outcome of the Bremen Conference, the Commission will consider what further actions are required in this context.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the difficulties faced by video rental companies in the United Kingdom caused by the fact that some film companies have ceased to give video rental companies a privileged rental window prior to the retail sale of the same film. The Commission understands that this is exposing such companies to increased competition from retail selling of the films which may constrain the rental revenues of such films.</p>
<p>On the basis of the indications provided by the honourable Member, it would seem that the effects of the alleged restrictive practice are likely to be felt essentially within the United Kingdom market. This would imply that, in the interest of an efficient enforcement of competition rules, the United Kingdom competition authorities would seem to be better placed to deal with such a case.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Commission cannot but take note that the Office of Fair Trading has already been informed of the issues raised in the letter of the honourable Member.

<p>(FR) The study on island and outermost regions was carried out during 2002. It was based on a broad range of statistical databases, including the regional databases of NewCronos/Eurostat and various national and local sources.</p>
<p>As far as the Ionian islands are concerned, the Greek National Statistics Office was contacted and supplied a number of variables which are recorded in the database containing all the quantitative information provided by the study.</p>
<p>During the course of the study, several other Greek sources were contacted, mainly the Greek meteorological service, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of the Marine and the University of the Aegean Sea. As far as per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is concerned, the results of the study appear to be reliable, although the data available only cover a NUTS II and III regional level. The regions do not always coincide with the archipelago or the individual islands.</p>
<p>This study was a first attempt to study the island regions and territories in a harmonised manner at European level. It allowed very diverse situations to be identified in these territories and also highlighted the lack of harmonised data.</p>

<p>On various occasions in recent months, the E17 Antwerp-Ghent-Lille motorway has been the scene of incredible accidents involving lorry drivers. Lorries are gradually being fitted with cruise control equipment. Inattentive drivers are driving at top speed into the back of traffic jams caused by road works.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated problem. Throughout Europe there are lorry and car accidents caused by cruise control. Such accidents cost lives. Over the last few weeks in Belgium alone, six people have died and 13 have been seriously injured in accidents involving cruise control.</p>
<p>Transport trade unions, too, consider that cruise control does their driver members more harm than good.</p>
<p>Is the Commission sufficiently well informed about the road safety impact of cruise control in lorries?</p>
<p>Is the Commission considering a cruise control ban for lorries? If so, on what timescale does it think that a ban can be established?

The Commission is concerned by the increase in accidents involving lorries, where the use of speed regulators appears to play a part. It is trying to collect objective information from the Belgian authorities which will enable it to evaluate any possible measures needed.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have any convincing data on the impact on road safety of speed regulators in lorries. On the contrary, studies – including in the Netherlands – have demonstrated that these regulators reduce fuel consumption by between 4 and 10%. They also help responsible drivers to keep to the speed limit.</p>
<p>As with other equipment in vehicles, it is clear that speed regulators require responsible use on the part of drivers. For example, it is not advisable to use these regulators in heavy or unstable traffic or in bad weather conditions. Nor does the Commission plan to ban the general use of speed regulators in lorries. It feels it is more important to improve the training of professional drivers, on which a directive was adopted by Parliament and the Council recently, and control of driving and rest times via the digital tachograph to be introduced in a year's time and via a larger number of controls, which are being planned within the framework of the next review of Directive 88/599<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

At the same time, the banks are multiplying their profits by charging interest rates of more than 11% on overdrafts and a number of other products, while big business receives preferential treatment through the possibility of investing in public and private securities which yield far greater rates of interest than savings accounts but are not available to the general public.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for its question concerning the erosion of savings of ordinary people in Greece.</p>
<p>At the outset the Commission would like to recall that, within a context of heightened financial market integration in the Union, a common monetary policy and a single currency in the euro area, market conditions for financial institutions in Member States are increasingly competitive. However, individual financial institutions, whilst being influenced by common factors such as a change in the market borrowing/lending rate, may still decide the conditions applied to their customers according to their own individual strategy, balance sheet and other considerations. For example, in times of weak economic growth, financial institutions may decide to give more weight to risk considerations than otherwise.</p>
<p>Investment in securities bring the potential for greater return than cash deposits but this is in exchange for greater risk to capital, so care needs to be taken in comparing the returns available from deposit accounts and securities. As regards the situation in Greece that the honourable Member refers to, the Commission is currently not aware of any discriminatory access to investment products for Greek citizens, although the Commission has in the past dealt with a case of fiscal discrimination of the income derived from investment funds. This case was investigated by the Commission and, following the commitment of the Greek authorities to rectify the situation, was closed in 2002. Should any additional and more precise information be brought to the Commission's attention, it will investigate the matter further.</p>
<p>The Commission has consulted the Greek Competition Authority on the existence of a collusion or an abuse of a collective dominant position by financial institutions in Greece. The Greek Competition Authority does not have any significant indications that can lead to the suspicion of an infringement of competition law but it will keep a close look at the relevant market and will conduct an investigation in case there is a behaviour that can possibly harm competition.</p>
<p>In addition, at this stage, from the Commission market monitoring experience, there are no concrete indications of an infringement of articles 81 or 82 of the EC Treaty. However, the Commission would reconsider this conclusion if it becomes aware of concrete evidence of a competition law infringement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0514"></a>

<p>The distribution of child pornography over the Internet is assuming alarming proportions and is even affecting countries such as Greece where the percentage of the population with Internet access is low. Recently in Volos, a network was uncovered illegally distributing photographic and video material via a website with 5000 members and over 600 000 visitors. Some estimates put the number of similar sites in Europe at over 10 000.</p>
<p>Will the Commission take the necessary measures to prosecute electronic crime and, in particular, child pornography effectively, which will target providers and users alike, protect the victims, combat the degrading of human life and support the services and NGOs fighting this inhuman crime?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member of Parliament about the growing problem of child pornography distributed through the Internet. It believes there is need for continuous efforts to combat harmful and illegal content on the Internet through international co-operation amongst governments, particularly law enforcement and judicial authorities, but also between governments and the Internet industry, dedicated hotlines and non-governmental organisations to effectively tackle this horrifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for dealing with illegal content (including child pornography) lies with the appropriate law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Member States, which co-operate internationally in the fight against child pornography on the Internet through the existing channels of communications, such as Europol and Interpol.</p>
<p>However, the Union has been a forerunner in the fight against illegal and harmful content since 1996, thanks to the joint approach adopted by the Parliament and the Council. The Safer Internet Action Plan adopted by the Council and the Parliament in 1999 <a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a major element in the Commission’s activity in this field. It provides funding for a European network of hotlines allowing users to report illegal content, including child pornography. In March 2002 <a href="#defann_64_2" name="refann_64_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, on the basis of a Commission proposal, the current Action Plan was extended for a second phase of two years, in line with a review that took account of past experience and new technologies, so as to ensure co-ordination with parallel work in the field of network and information security.</p>
<p>The Union strategy to combat child pornography also consists of legal instruments and practical measures against computer crime and child pornography. These include the Commission proposal for a Council Framework Decision <a href="#defann_64_3" name="refann_64_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on approximation of laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet <a href="#defann_64_4" name="refann_64_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which the Commission hopes the Council will be able to adopt formally in the very near future, and the Council Recommendation of September 1998 <a href="#defann_64_5" name="refann_64_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and the Council Decision of May 2000 to combat child pornography on the Internet <a href="#defann_64_6" name="refann_64_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As an example, at the beginning of 2003, the Commission received the final version of the 'International Child Exploitation Database' feasibility study, which was co-funded under the STOP II Programme and run by a project group composed by experts from several Member States. The project group has issued various recommendations, highlighting the need for introducing a sophisticated networked international child sexual exploitation image database, building on the fledgling system at Interpol. Such a database, would have to take into account the different national laws governing images of child sexual exploitation and protection of personal data.</p>
<p>In March 2003, the Commission received an application by several Member States, Europol and other third Countries under the AGIS programme for funding an implementation study as a concrete follow-up to a feasibility study concluded in December 2002. Applications are now being evaluated according to the rules of the funding programme. The final funding decision will be announced by autumn.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Safer Internet Programme provides funding for activities aimed at combating illegal and harmful content, as part of a coherent approach by the European Union. ‘Safer Internet’ aims at:</p>
<p>ensuring more extensive interfacing with programmes and actions conducted at national level,</p>
<p>improving exchange of information and best practice between Member States,</p>
<p>developing software enabling parents and/or teachers to limit children’s access to inappropriate material and content on the Internet,</p>
<p>offering dedicated web services which provide safe access to the Internet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
