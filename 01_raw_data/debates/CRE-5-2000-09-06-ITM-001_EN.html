<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. –</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Klamt, who was the original rapporteur designated by the committee which I have the honour to chair to look at this issue. Mrs Klamt did a very considerable amount of work on the proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification. She deserves the credit for the work that has been done. I wish to congratulate her on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have inherited this particular cornucopia as chairman of the committee because Mrs Klamt felt at the end of the votes at committee stage that she could no longer support the text as it stood and therefore I am presenting it to the House today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend the European Commission on what is an extremely well argued and well presented report, drawn up in record time considering the relative lack of resources of the departments concerned and the demands laid down at the European Council in Tampere last year. The Commission has come forward with an excellent draft directive which will permit third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State of the Union to reside in another Member State as is required if a true area of freedom, security and justice is to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has said, quite rightly in my view, that the goal of zero immigration mentioned in past Community discussion was never realistic and sought instead to put forward realistic proposals for the protection of the rights of third-country nationals in accordance with the many international treaties that have been signed by Member States, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants of 1966 on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Very clearly, the importance of legal immigration is recognised. The importance of the family as a unit is also recognised and the importance of making a success of the integration of third-country nationals residing lawfully in EU Member States is the whole basis of these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in my committee considered a number of contentious areas, not least the question of the right to bring in ascending relatives. The Commission proposal quite clearly recognises the difference of legal treatment between descending and ascending relatives. It is evident that, in the context of the international legal framework, mention must be made of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This convention requires states to ensure that the child is not separated from the parents. There is no similar convention dealing with ascending relatives, but it is clearly the case that if we wish to live up to our humanitarian ideals we must provide the opportunity for third-country nationals to bring dependent relatives in the ascending line into their family units. This has been a matter of some debate within the committee. I am pleased to see that a number of amendments to the final report have been put forward; in particular Amendments Nos 18 to 23, which propose a compromise on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">May I briefly introduce some of the amendments that the committee's report puts forward. Amendment No 3 looks at the need for data and recognises that in order to have an effective evaluation of the situation in the Member States, the Commission will need more information from the Member States. Amendment No 5 deals with relatives from the ascending line. This has now been overtaken in a sense by the compromise Amendments Nos 18 to 23. Amendment No 6 recognises the very real problems that the administrations of the Member States currently have with the workload created by the demands of family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 allows each Member State to introduce more favourable provisions than those set down in the directives, and insists that these new rules will not lower current standards of protection. Amendment No 11 deals with the grounds on which a Member State may deny the right of entry to a relative, namely on grounds of public policy, domestic security and public health. Our amendment seeks to insist that any Member State wishing to refuse entry on those grounds provides very clear justification.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to comment on all of the 66 amendments put forward to my report, but I would say that this is a very complicated area. Parliament had relatively little time to look at it and inevitably not all of the compromises which were necessary to reach a favourable outcome were achieved in committee. I would therefore urge Members to look carefully at the amendments that have been tabled in plenary to reach the compromises which will allow us to go forward in an effective and humanitarian way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reason I said that my committee’s task was an easy one, is because the proposed draft directive raises few difficulties from a legal viewpoint, and nor is there a great deal of room for manoeuvre when it comes to framing policy. I would also like to say how impressed I am with the logistical quality of the draft directive, which certainly cannot be said of all the Commission’s draft directives. Pursuant to the new Article 63 of the EU Treaty, it is now the Community’s task to settle the matter of family reunification, and the Community must take these measures in accordance with the provisions of international law, in particular the European Convention of Human Rights and the other instruments of international law already mentioned by our committee chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to respect for family life is a universal human right. It is not divisible and cannot be reserved for EU citizens alone. This would be a dubious line to take, particularly as we are concurrently working on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If Community provisions are now to be put in place for family reunification, we also need to close incomprehensible and, in some cases, absurd gaps in the existing legislation. This particularly applies to the right of EU citizens themselves to live together in their home land with family members originating from a third country and not to be in the position where the only way they can live with them as a family is to avail themselves of freedom of movement and settle in another Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore this directive is only too welcome from a legal viewpoint, and it is to be hoped that neither Parliament, nor, more importantly, the Council, will make any changes to the substance of the Commission’s original draft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has put forward the first draft of a legislative initiative in this field, which concerns the right to family reunification. Unfortunately, it failed to place this draft directive in an overall frame of reference. What point is there in knowing which family members have the right to enter and reside in the EU, when it is not known what provisions are to be made for which immigrant groups and for which reasons for immigration?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Parliament is expected to vote on a legislative initiative which lacks absolute fundamental principles. We have neither a joint evaluation of demographic trends, nor do we know what impact this legislative initiative will have on the individual Member States. Unfortunately, the lack of overall strategy and statistical basis are not the only weak points. The Commission lumps economically motivated immigration and asylum together. I take the view that as far as family reunification is concerned, there should be one set of arrangements for asylum seekers and refugees, and one for immigrants. Different rules must apply to those who have been driven out of their native land than apply to those who emigrate for economic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to clearly distinguish between asylum seekers and refugees on the one hand, and immigration, i.e. economic migration, on the other. This will allow for provisions that do justice to the people concerned and the situations they are in. Many of my proposed amendments have this distinction in view.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem with the present draft directive concerns the widening of the definition of family. Grandparents, children over the age of majority and non-married partners should also be entitled to family reunification. That is where the dilemma lies: there is no overall frame of reference for immigration. As such, family reunification is currently the only legal channel of immigration. The proposed sweeping provisions on family reunification are open to uncontrollable abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Just ask yourselves this question: who will decide, according to which criteria, whether a relationship is bogus, contrived purely for the purposes of immigration? That is why quite a few of my proposed amendments call for priority to be given to the core family. Another cardinal sin committed by the Commission is that its proposal contains no measures whatsoever for integration. It is not right to bring people to a foreign country without making the necessary provisions for foreign nationals and local people to live together in peace and friendship.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point to be made is that a directive of this kind is paving the way for us to have an objective and constructive discussion on the whole area of immigration. If people feel they are being overrun by waves of immigrants, then their reaction is one of rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">If we put transparent, enforceable provisions in place, then people will be more inclined to allow foreign nationals to integrate. By producing moderate and well-considered solutions, not only will we be able to overcome problems such as xenophobia; we will also be able to tackle the problems associated with having a disproportionate number of elderly people in the European Union. However, this draft directive seems to be a poor first attempt at this. Thank you for your attention.</p>

I wanted to begin by congratulating the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino on this proposal which seems to me to be very complete, well constructed and timely, coming almost a year after the Tampere Summit. We must clarify today in this Parliament whether we want the immigrants and refugees who live amongst us to do so legally with their families, giving them the opportunity to live a normal life and to integrate fully into our society, or whether we are going to continue to feed the myth that they are provisional co-citizens whose final destiny is to return to the hypothetical homes they came from.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is so important that we must make an effort to reach a consensus. All of our groups were in agreement in committee, apart from the PPE Group. I would like us today to send a message to the people who live amongst us that they can do so with their right to live as a family recognised. Mr President, this is the intention of my group, although I would also like to ask the Commission, on behalf of my group, to think twice about one aspect included in the current directive. We have also applied these rules we are debating to people who are under alternative protection. Unfortunately, the European Union does not have homogenous criteria. There is no harmonised asylum policy. Therefore, there are very different situations in many countries, and on this minor point I would agree with Mrs Klamt.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of rejecting these people – they have the right to live as families – but of the Commission thinking twice about it and of their being subject to a future directive which would include persons under temporary and alternative protection, while we await the future harmonisation of the Union’s asylum policy. Otherwise, I congratulate the Commission and I hope that it receives the full support of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the ELDR Group is backing this report as one of the essential building blocks in constructing the area of freedom, security and justice and in following up the Tampere Summit, which rightly made it a priority to establish rights of free movement for legally resident third-country nationals. This is an injustice which needs remedying.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Terrón i Cusí, I am surprised at the stance of the EPP Group, which normally puts a lot of emphasis on family values and yet today is undermining the family by opposing reunification, which will assist the social integration of these legally resident migrants. This seems to us perverse.</p>
<p class="contents">To take up some specific points in the report, first of all on the inclusion of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. We will wait to hear Mr Vitorino, but it is rumoured that the Commission will accept amendments to take these beneficiaries out. The ELDR Group would regret that because we think that, like refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should be in. They are long-term residents, they are not analogous to beneficiaries of temporary protection. We will listen to the debate because our overwhelming desire is to get the bones of this proposal through.</p>
<p class="contents">On ascending relatives, we consider that Amendment No 20 is superfluous because there is a general right in Article 9 of the proposal to apply a non-discriminatory means test to all entrants. However we are willing to look at that if it assists in saving the report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to be absolutely clear on unmarried partners. The proposal will not force Member States to give legal recognition to unmarried partnerships, but if they do they must treat unmarried partners like spouses. There has been a lot of misinformation on this, not least stirred up by the Conservatives in the United Kingdom – tabloid headlines about outrageous plots by the EU to force the UK to accept refugees' gay lovers. That is stirring up homophobic prejudice and I deplore it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and Commissioner Vitorino have done some sterling work here, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to take the opportunity to thank them for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council confirmed, at its special summit in Tampere, that the European Union must ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly. The Commission has taken this resolution forward. This directive is conclusive as it stands, and should be transposed with all haste. Sadly there were, and still are, reservations against including refugees benefiting from temporary protection in this directive, and against recognising same-sex relationships as the basis for family reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate demonstrates once again that, unfortunately, integration and migration policy is still a controversial issue in the European Union. There is, after all, a great deal to be considered. Nevertheless, we must make it possible for people who live apart from relatives who are third-country nationals, to be brought together. Therefore, in principle, this is an initiative that deserves everyone’s support, particularly where it concerns children, and these self-same children – irrespective of whether they are the offspring of refugees or immigrants – should have a future in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, opinion is being stirred up against this directive in the political arena. It is to be hoped that the majority of honourable members will support the directive put forward by the Commission as it stands. I know that my fellow socialist members are awaiting a statement from Mr Vitorino, in the hope that refugees’ interests will be sacrificed for the sake of this directive, under pressure from quite a number of EU Ministers for Home Affairs. I regret this decision, and the fact that Ministers for Home Affairs appear to carry more weight in this Parliament than the honourable members, who are expected to act according to their consciences.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I reiterate my call for us to support the Commission’s directive and at last set down a marker for an up-to-date, modern and humane policy of integration. I hope the Socialists will refrain from making this deal with the Conservatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Too often, when we broach the subject of immigration, passions, excesses and political ulterior motives prevent us from reflecting objectively and making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In dealing in depth with the issue of the right to live as a family, and in defining the precise conditions for its application, the text enables us to hold a real debate. Far from casting suspicion <span class="italic">a priori</span>, as is often the case, on those who wish to live with their spouses and children, the text recognises the legitimacy of such a right even if, in fact, this right must now apply equally to homosexual couples and to all other categories, as the honourable Member has just said, especially in the case of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">The text also takes into account that nowadays there are several types of families in our society, especially certain forms of cohabitation, and that we cannot therefore discriminate against immigrants who live in the same way. In recognising this, the text helps to give real meaning to the term ‘integration’. Through harmonising legislation in Member States, this draft directive will provide protection and legal stability for immigrants and will above all prevent them from being subjected to national political fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that subsequent work by the Commission and Parliament will take its inspiration from this example. Perhaps we will then be able to talk further on the equality of rights and the often positive contribution made by immigration, in dealing with issues that are vital for integration and the fight against the unemployment, insecure employment, violence and discrimination, of which immigrants are often victim.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration is not a problem. Yet we must resolve to talk about the real problems such as the imbalances between the North and the South that often force men and women to flee from poverty. We must also recognise that the waves of immigrants towards the countries of the European Union have been more or less constant for a couple of decades. In other words, by implementing restrictive laws, Member States have not succeeded in reducing the overall number of entrants; they have simply reduced the number of legal immigrants while increasing the numbers of illegal immigrants by declaring them illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">By underpinning these values, this draft directive will not only have positive consequences for immigrants and their families, but it will also be a symbol for refuge and integration. I sincerely hope that we will be able to follow the same line of conduct in subsequent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, there would be cause to worry about a certain form of capitalism that imports workers and cuts them off from their families, with all the risks of rootlessness that could give rise to. But today we have gone well beyond that.</p>
<p class="contents">What were initially nothing more than a temporary work contracts are tending to turn into permanent residence. What has become permanent for one person is tending to become permanent for that person’s family and friends. Initially it was just the close family, but now it is the extended family as well. And we are very well aware that the extended family is extensive, given the social structures of the countries of origin, in which the registration of births, marriages and deaths is sometimes only rather ad hoc. And then, from the extended family – brothers, cousins, nephews, parents, grand parents – we move on to the polygamous family. And why favour just family ties? From the polygamous family, we move on to cohabitation and soon, as the preceding speaker, Mr Sylla, has just proposed, we will move on to mere homosexual association. These are the considerable risks resulting from this policy trend.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to end up with what we are already starting to witness; a veritable, suicidal immigration of entire populations, organised by Member States and European institutions alike. This is, quite manifestly, the suicide of Europe. The only solution worthy of the name is to organise family reunification but to organise it in the country of origin with the support of the policy of cooperation to which end these methods should be employed.</p>

I regret the way in which it was handled in the committee responsible, as this has led to the rapporteur being unable, in the final analysis, to identify with the outcome, causing her to withdraw her name. A rather singular occurrence. As I see it, constructive and well-founded amendments proposed by the rapporteur – which she has expounded and justified again today, and which I am therefore in a position to refer to – as well as by other members of the committee, were simply swept aside and not handled properly, for reasons of political ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">In assessing this improper conduct, I would refer – on behalf of Austria, among others – to the decision taken by the conference of the heads of provincial governments on 17 May 2000, whereby all the new Austrian heads of the provincial governments rejected the draft directive in this form, unanimously and in fact right across the political divide. I am sorry that the committee has behaved in this way, because I believe a sledgehammer approach does the cause more harm than good, particularly in an area as sensitive as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wording on the outside belies the actual contents of these documents. We would be delighted to endorse family reunification measures, for this would be deeply humane and would also be key to an integration component, but what we have is something entirely different. This is about initiating sociopolitical debate on how far the circle of those entitled to family reunification can be extended beyond the core family.</p>
<p class="contents">You include a proposal relating to unmarried partners, whose parents and children would be allowed to join them, according to which, testimonies from the country of origin would be enough to satisfy you as to the authenticity of a relationship, regardless as to how it appears. This would mean that children or parents joining members here would have the same rights as EU citizens in the educational, employment and social spheres. The traffickers in human beings and the document forgers will thank those of you who support this proposal, and you can rest assured that the general public’s response will be one of indignation.</p>
<p class="contents">You also include a proposal relating to multiple marriages, i.e. the first wife is to be accepted along with the children and relatives in the ascending line. However, you also make the point in this document that naturally it would be possible to bring another wife and her dependants in, if this were necessary for the sake of the child’s welfare. This begs the question as to how much wider the door is to be opened to uncontrollable immigration?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the proposal under discussion is unacceptable. It lacks an overall frame of reference, a statistical basis and there is no differentiation. You are also overstepping the mark in respect of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which requires the integration capacity of each of the Member States to be taken into account. We have no intention of voting for this document unless it includes our amendments and follows our political line.</p>

<p class="contents">This problem requires us to work on a particularly sensitive issue, that of shaping and harmonising a European immigration policy. This will be one of the major issues of the twenty-first century. The European Commission’s draft directive establishing the right to family reunification is perfectly timed, and I would like to congratulate the Commission particularly on this text, which was drawn up under the auspices of Commissioner Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to family reunification is crucial to normal family life. What is more, this right has long existed in the form of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which all persons have the right to family life. But this is a particularly sensitive issue in view of the different laws existing in the various Member States, as it can come into conflict with notions of sovereignty. But that is the gauntlet that has been thrown down to the European Parliament, which must succeed in transcending these differences.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive we are being asked to give our opinion on today is, in my view, a text of major importance, and it must receive the firm backing of the European Parliament. This text holds out real prospects for legal immigration, most of which is family immigration. As has already been said, this directive is the first example of this type of structure resulting from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council, which is why it is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the modern world has many advantages, but for certain categories of people, including foreigners, there is a significant risk of exclusion. It is our duty as European democrats to be particularly diligent in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive proposed by the Commission enables us to take a major step forward, under conditions that are entirely satisfactory, but with all the necessary guarantees. There has never been any question of authorising polygamous family groupings, contrary to what I have just heard. This is utterly false. Let us remember that this is the first text in the process of integrating the ‘justice and internal affairs’ pillar into community policy in the wake of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council last November. Let us also remember that this is no more and no less than a matter of establishing the right to family reunification and that we must stop seeing family reunification as a privilege.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, what is at stake is the construction of a Citizens’ Europe, something we are hoping and praying for in order to be able to continue to build Europe. It is up to us to seize this opportunity. Otherwise we will not succeed.</p>

That said, restrictive conditions are still being placed on the process of family reunification. I believe we should be highlighting the fact that, in the final analysis, it is unemployment and insecure employment that should be banned and not the right of immigrants to live with their families only if they can provide evidence of adequate means and a roof over their head.</p>
<p class="contents">For the nationals of a country, society makes progress slowly, but it does make progress, witness the PACS vote in France, but the notion of the family in the case of immigrants is inflexible. The laws in force provide for the right of residence to be revoked if there is a break-up in the matrimonial household, effectively outlawing divorce, and, as has just been said, homosexual couples are still not recognised. Under the pretext of combating polygamy, second spouses and their children are condemned to illegality and to even greater dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">Family reunification must be liberated from the archaic conditions that still exist as a result of fanatical immigration control. In conclusion, Mr Watson’s report has fortunately made real progress following the work in committee on the initial report by Mrs Klamt. I am bound to say that, when I hear Mr Gollnisch’s racist, reactionary and unacceptable comments, I want to vote for this report. It is a question of dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has far more to do with establishing in precise terms, which third-country family members should be entitled to join relations who are immigrants to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together. But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members. For example, I have a wife and two children, and they have children too. I also have siblings and aunts and uncles. If I were to count the number of relatives I live in close contact with, that makes 25 all told. Commissioner Vitorino, if I were to apply for asylum in Portugal, for example, then clearly I would be unable to assert a claim to live there with 25 relatives. In other words, we must be sensible and draw the line somewhere. That is the crucial problem we face with this directive. We must also distinguish between those whose stay in the European Union subject to a time limit, and those who reside here permanently. I should point out that this draft directive extends family reunification provisions beyond those that have been in force in the Member States to date. This sends out another signal to would-be immigrants, which will, of course, have major consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive would have very different implications for States with a high proportion of immigrants, such as Austria, Germany and the Benelux States, than it would for States such as Portugal, Finland and others, which do not see very much in the way of immigration. We cannot endorse this directive as matters stand, because it would lead to a dramatic increase in family reunification, which is one of the main grounds for reunification. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect for your work, I cherish the hope that the Council will decline to give it the unanimous assent it requires.</p>

At last, Europe is on the move, after decades of zero immigration and, more especially, after so many years of refusal by Europeans to grant third-country nationals residing lawfully in the European Union their fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising the right to family life is one of the basic conditions for the integration of refugees and migrants in the social life of the country in which they reside. Unfortunately, those in this Parliament who extol the virtues of the family and hold it up as the highest ideal happen to be the very people who undermine it. This is exactly what is happening with this draft directive on the reunification of the families of refugees and migrants. Self-righteous hypocrisy is the main feature of this wing of the European Parliament, and we have experienced it again and again.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I would like to say that I understand the qualms of many governments, including my own, concerning this draft directive. Indeed, countries such as Germany, where millions of refugees and migrants have sought refuge, are shouldering an enormous burden. But at the same time I would like to point out and to highlight the enormous contribution that refugees and migrants make to the economic development of our countries, through their work and through taxation. The social burden that is referred to by the critics of the proposal may be reduced if refugees and their family members have the right to work, as provided for by the Commission proposal</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that this directive sets out the minimum requirements, and governments retain the right to put in place better conditions for the reunification of families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino, although I hold you in high regard – and have said as much on many occasions in this House – the Commission document itself is shot through with negligent ignorance as to the situation in the very Member States that have been generous enough to accord large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers the right to protection and hospitality over the past few years. You ask too much of our society, and in so doing, run the risk of creating a breeding ground for something that we have always fought against in this House. The liberal and social democrat delegates from the large Member States – because so far today, I have only heard speakers of this political persuasion from the small Member States – must ask themselves whether they are remotely in touch with the electorate, whether they are aware of the consequences, and whether they have grasped that more authority for Parliament in these matters would also bring increased responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The age is past when we could hold forth here on our dreams for making the world a better place, without repercussions. I would be very interested to see how you intend to justify today’s decision to your electorate. Many of you will only vote in favour of this proposal today because you know full well that the Council will never endorse it as it stands. I feel this is unworthy of you. It is contrary to our task and to the mandate we have been given by the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to briefly pick up on the comments you made about polygamous marriages, which caused you to shake your head. For goodness sake, go and read Article 3, paragraph 2, which says: therefore, whilst it is not permissible to bring in several wives and their children, it is, on the other hand, permissible to bring in one wife and her children. This means I could have married someone here in the Member States, and would be at liberty, under certain circumstances, to have at least one more wife join me. In other words, there is admissibility. That is the fact of the matter. In this way, it would be possible….</p>

<p class="contents">... no, that is precisely how it can be interpreted in legal terms! It gives free rein to all kinds of interpretations. There is only one thing we can do here, and that is reject this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force that the European Parliament has been consulted on a Commission proposal for a Council directive on the matter of the lawful immigration of persons originating from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a sign of the profound institutional changes introduced by the Treaty and given top priority on the European political agenda by the Heads of State and Government at the Tampere European Council. The Commission has decided that a proposal on family reunification should start us off on this journey, this considerable effort to construct a common European immigration policy. I should also like to begin by explaining why we have chosen this subject – in answer to a critical observation from Mrs Klamt, whom, regardless of our differences of opinion, I should like to congratulate on the work she has carried out as the first rapporteur for this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe family reunification is a concept that is thoroughly coherent with the commitments that all the Member States undertook several decades ago in the sphere of international law. From the reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the international convenants made under the United Nations in 1966, to the European Convention on Human Rights itself – in all these instruments of international law family protection is upheld as an essential factor for ensuring social peace. I do not believe anybody can deny that family reunification is also an important instrument for the integration of immigrants from third countries into their host societies. This has indeed been repeatedly recognised by the bodies of the European Union. That is, since 1993 the Council has been devoting constant attention to the subject of family reunification. It must also be recognised that family reunification is significant in numerical terms because it is today one of the main causes of immigration into the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is not creating this flow of migrants; what the directive intends is to regulate a situation that already exists on the ground. Those who refuse to see that this directive aims at setting up legal rules to respond to a situation that already exists on the ground and try to blame the Commission for inventing a new flow of migrants are therefore being unfair in their analysis of the actual situation that we are addressing.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission decided that family reunification should be given priority treatment over other forms of lawful immigration. It is not a matter of deciding on entry and residence for economic purposes, or the immigration of workers, or the immigration of students. As we see it, it is a matter of regulating a different form of admittance in response to values – that is, family protection – and a strategic political objective: the promotion of the integration of third-country nationals who are already living lawfully in the Union into their host societies. We are basing our approach on a principle which is debatable, but without any evidence to the contrary I believe it can be demonstrated. This is that family reunification is a factor which promotes the personal stability of the immigrant, since family life is always an important instrument for integration into the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government at Tampere in fact unanimously stressed the need to ensure equitable treatment for third-country nationals who are lawfully resident in the Member States of the Union. They also stressed that a more dynamic integration policy needs to be developed in parallel, and that this policy should aim at offering third-country nationals rights and duties comparable to those held by the citizens of the Union. These, then, ladies and gentlemen, are the values and political commitments upon which the Commission has based its proposal. I should also like to point out that the Commission has proposed an initiative in which family reunification is seen as a right. This is not, however, an absolute right of the third-country citizens who reside in the Union’s Member States, and reside there lawfully. Instead it is a right subject to conditions, whether procedural in nature or material conditions regarding the definition of the status of the family members in the country to which they have been admitted and regarding the rights that they enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am willing to discuss all the implications of this proposal, also because the French Presidency considers this subject to be central during the six-month term for which it is responsible. For our part, we are also willing to introduce an amended proposal as quickly as possible so that we can achieve a positive outcome during the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the debate. Here as in the Commission it has been a lively, at times even passionate debate, because it deals with a sensitive issue on which, naturally, each country puts forward a very strong case for its own situation. It is difficult to find common ground at European level. Above all, however, this debate has one fundamental feature. It is no longer a debate on statements of intention: it is a debate on rules, binding legal provisions, which will have to be implemented. It is therefore natural that it should be a lively, even passionate debate, and one in which there are divergent views.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers your opinion to be of the utmost importance. And I should like to congratulate Mr Wilson on the job he has done in presenting a report under the difficult circumstances in which this debate has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to explain to you all what the Commission’s position is on the more difficult political issues in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the scope of the proposal: the Commission believes that refugees should be included within its scope, because from a political viewpoint it would be incomprehensible if economic migrants were granted a right to family reunification that we did not grant to refugees recognised under the Geneva Convention. I accept, however, that it is necessary to exclude the beneficiaries of temporary protection or subsidiary protection. This is not a matter of going back on a question of principle. I am convinced that a certain kind of beneficiary of temporary or subsidiary protection should also have the right to family reunification. I do recognise, however, that the lack of harmonisation of this concept at European level and especially the Commission’s intention to submit a directive on temporary and subsidiary protection to Parliament and the Council next year will allow us to deal with the right to family reunification in that directive very soon. We therefore accept an amendment to the proposal excluding beneficiaries of temporary or subsidiary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Where issues relating to the concept of the family are concerned, I should like to make it very clear that in this proposal the Commission is not interfering in the matter of defining the concept of the family. This proposal fully accepts that each Member State has the competence to define what a family is, as well as the issue, for instance, of unmarried partnerships. This proposal does not say that all the Member States will be obliged to recognise unmarried partnerships and accept unmarried partners under all circumstances. We are simply saying that in those countries where unmarried partnerships are placed on an equal footing with marriage in domestic law for their own nationals, these unmarried partnerships must also be recognised for the purpose of family reunification for third-country nationals. I should therefore like to state clearly that there is nothing in this proposal favouring family reunification for polygamous marriages. I am sorry, but the text is quite clear! It is not possible to apply for a second wife to come! Only one exception is made: for the children of the second marriage if the interests of the child so justify. But how could you explain treating the children of a second polygamous marriage differently from the children of a first marriage or the children of an unmarried partnership? I am not a subverter of moral values, but I think we have to keep the interests of the children in the forefront.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Commission is willing to accept a number of other amendments and other modifications regarding the rights of family members, the conditions and clarification of the conditions for family reunification, the situation in which the person being reunited may acquire independent status, and concerning procedural rules. Full details will be given before the vote is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that this is, of course, an exercise that will give rise to debate. The debate with the Council will not be easy, just as the debate with Parliament has not been easy. I respect the opinions of all Members. I should like the final opinion of Parliament to have as broad a support-base as possible. And I hope – regardless of our differences of opinion, which are to be expected and, may I say, useful and essential for democracy – that once this directive has been adopted, we may all be able to pool our efforts to solve the essential question that we have before us. This question is how we can create a clear and transparent legal framework that will ensure the integration of lawful immigrants into their host countries and we must do so because this integration is the key to the success of a common European immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
