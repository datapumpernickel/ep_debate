<p class="contents">The report concerns a long-awaited proposal for a directive which is crucial for facilitating the free movement of persons and which takes into account the work carried out at the end of the 1990s, in particular by the high level panel chaired by Mrs Simone Veil, on citizenship of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal lays down the conditions governing the exercise of the fundamental right of free movement and residence, which is conferred directly to every EU citizen by the Treaty and enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In this respect the proposal represents a first step towards defining a strong concept of citizenship of the European Union, as confirmed by the basic aim of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">EU citizens should <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis </span>be able to move between Member States on similar terms as nationals of a Member State moving around or changing their place of residence in their own country. In particular the directive should facilitate the exercise of the right to free movement by reducing administrative formalities to what is absolutely necessary, by better defining the situation of family members, by introducing a permanent right of residence after four years of uninterrupted residence in the host Member State, and by further restricting the scope for refusing or terminating residence on grounds of public order.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also introduces important innovations by comparison to the existing <span class="italic">acquis</span>. In particular it extends from three to six months the period during which citizens are not subject to any formalities other than the possession of a valid identity card or passport. It suppresses the obligation to obtain a residence permit for European Union citizens, replacing it with straightforward registration with the competent authorities, which is already the case in some Member States. It establishes a system in which the European Union citizen has simply to declare that he fulfils the conditions linked to the exercise of the right of residence. Finally, it introduces after four years of uninterrupted residence a permanent right of residence which is no longer subject to any conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As is rightly underlined in Mr Santini's report, the right to free movement is still subject today to many obstacles. This has been confirmed in the repeated judgments of the Court of Justice on the matter. This proposal incorporates the clarifications made by the Court's recent decisions and, once adopted, it should considerably simplify the exercise of the fundamental rights of every European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santini (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for this introduction, which paves the way for the presentation of my report. Indeed, the directive we are discussing represents a genuine leap forward in the debate on citizenship of the Union and the free movement of persons. For the first time, the citizen is recognised as having rights not just as an economic entity but as a person, as the holder of individual rights which, together with general rights, make up European citizenship. The rights of free movement and residence derive directly from the European Treaty, they have long been established, as the Commissioner said, and they confer on the citizens new, major fundamental rights. Indeed, one might say that this directive lays the foundations of dual citizenship – national and European citizenship – as formulated in the draft Treaty discussed in the Convention too. The introduction of the right to permanent residence is a concrete example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Before looking at the directive in more detail, we should specify its scope. It is directed at Community citizens and members of their families, of whatever nationality. The principle of equal treatment of third citizens who are members of a Community family has been established since the sixties and the directive makes it even more efficient and effective. </p>
<p class="contents">This is a right derived from the right of the Community citizen of whose family they are members. It must be made clear from the outset that this directive does not apply to the citizens of third countries or, in any case, not to those who are not related to Community citizens, even if they are living in a Member State or enjoy free movement within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The great merit of this directive is that it combines all the previous provisions on the subject in a single text. Another merit is its clarity and, in this regard, I feel that some of the rapporteur’s amendments, not least, have helped to simplify the excessively bureaucratic sections as far as is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The most innovative elements include the proposal to replace the residence card, as the Commissioner mentioned, with a simple certificate of registration with the competent authorities. The registration procedures must be straightforward and direct and, in any case, the principle of self-certification must be applied, as it already is in some Member States. The principle of self-certification must also apply to the provision of proof of income and health insurance cover too. In the case of family members who are third-country nationals, an identity document must be supplied in order to prove the existence of a family relationship, purely in order to prevent abuses, which are always possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A further innovative principle introduced by the directive concerns the expulsion of third country citizens who are entitled to residence on Community territory. The directive stipulates that they cannot be expelled under any circumstances whatsoever. This approach applies the ‘Amsterdam objective’, namely the creation of a border-free area of freedom, security and justice, but some of the Member States will probably want to establish their own rules on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have saved the most controversial issue until last, as always happens when debates are introduced in this Chamber: the family, its composition and the definitions of couple and spouse. To avoid such a vast wealth of innovative legislation being hijacked by the usual tug of war, as rapporteur, I have striven to be as open as possible, stretching my principles and the principles of the political group I represent to the limits in the interests of completing the process with the directive intact. Moreover, there is no ambiguity over the definition of spouse in terms of Community law, as the Court of Justice has confirmed on a number of occasions. In this connection and in relation to unmarried couples too, the rapporteur has appropriated a number of amendments tabled and then withdrawn by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which appeal to the laws of the different Member States with a view to putting an end to the discrepancies which still exist at Community level. In my opinion, this democratic appeal to subsidiarity, to national sovereignty, respects all interests and should avoid the usual crusades which could well diminish the content of the report and render its scope ineffective. In short, each Member State can regulate family issues on the basis of its own legislation and concerns. It would be a real shame if we were unable to succeed in delivering a worthy text enjoying broad support to the Council, considering the marvellous opportunity of codecision we have on this matter. Moreover, it is inconceivable that we should impose on 13 States a model supported by only two of them, or that priority should be given to symbols and dogmas rather than responsible rules awaited by millions of citizens who want to be able to organise their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it has to be said that the rapporteur’s approach is, for the most part, in line with that of the Commission, which has produced a coherent, objective text which, as we already know, also expresses the Council’s position. We have the opportunity to give the citizens new, modern rules which provide greater guarantees of civil liberties. I am confident that they will be adopted at the vote in this Chamber and I would like to thank the committee draftsmen and all the Members who have contributed to the report with their amendments, which have, without a doubt, improved the content of the directive.</p>

<p class="contents">In accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice, the rights of European citizenship, including the right to free movement and residence within the Union, were fundamental rights of European citizens, whose recognition did not require any legislative implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this legal basis, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered that there was no reason for the establishment of restrictions of an administrative nature, either for entry into a country or for free movement and residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Much progress has been made in the field of legislative organisation by means of the Schengen Agreements, but it is the case that certain countries are still resisting this progress and are not participating in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market hoped that this proposal for a directive would represent an effective step forward by removing all the restrictions in terms of administration and content to a citizen’s ability to establish themselves in another Community country.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the purpose of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market were not accepted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the rapporteur would naturally like them to be maintained, but has not insisted, in order not to jeopardise the agreements reached in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to an amendment, however, which could to a certain extent respond to the concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I am referring to Amendment No 23 – which introduces a new Article 4(b) – which says that ‘This Directive shall not lead to the withdrawal of existing rights established by the legislation of the European Union or Court of Justice decision’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this amendment is essential if we do not want to move backwards in terms of the rights of European citizens within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed amendments submitted by the European Parliament have of course improved the Commission’s proposal significantly. The amendments submitted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities aim to bring about a number of improvements to reinforce the free movement of women, taking account of the specific problems faced by women and the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Commissioner, your ambition to allow European citizens to exercise their right of residence freely and without impediment has not resulted in a text that is gender neutral and takes account of the specific problems faced by women. The main problem concerns women who are economically dependent on their husbands and who, in the event of death or separation, have no prospects of extending their right or continuing to reside in another European country. In other words, they are automatically deprived of any legal rights derived from their residing in another Member State of the Union. We feel this needs correcting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities also emphasises the importance of protecting all interpersonal relations by giving live-in partners of either sex the same rights as a spouse. More and more Member States are finding ways of recognising couples who live together without officially getting married. Most countries now allow partners to be officially registered and this category therefore needs to be included in the definition of family members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What the directive has in mind is that journeys by EU citizens between the Member States should be subject to the same conditions as those undertaken within individual Member States, in other words, the intention is to demolish the remaining barriers and surmount the bureaucratic and political hurdles and obstacles that block the way to freedom of movement. This leads me, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to emphatically endorse the Commission proposal and the refinements and modifications that our esteemed rapporteur has made to it. Such is our objective towards which we are journeying, and I am convinced that we can reach that objective providing that certain conditions are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed by the way in which certain Members, in this debate on the great issue of freedom of movement, focussed their attention, to the exclusion of all else, on the definition of what we are meant to mean by ‘family’. Although this is just a small part of the whole, and needs to be discussed, we should bid farewell to the view that a select few know what is meant by ‘family’, and that their definition should be imposed on all other Members of this House or on the Member States. That is not acceptable. We should arrive at a compromise, and do so by accepting the fact that the various states have different conceptions of this and make different arrangements for it. What we should not be doing is allowing the few to take it upon themselves to impose their concept and definition of the family on all the other states. If we can manage to stand back and arrive at consensus by accepting individual Member States' diverse arrangements, this proposal will win acceptance by a broad majority. In the interests of EU citizens' freedom of movement, I appeal to all those who have introduced these proposals to follow where reason leads.</p>

<p class="contents">Citizenship of the Union – institutionalised and created as such by the Treaty of Maastricht and later modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam – confers a series of rights and duties on the nationals of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is to associate the citizens with the process of European integration, giving them more involvement, strengthening the protection of their rights and promoting the idea of a European identity by means of the creation of a sense of belonging amongst the citizens of the Union. The citizenship rights and the Union as a whole will only have credibility amongst the citizens if they can be applied in practice in their everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of citizenship of the Union, one of the fundamental rights that citizenship confers is laid down in Article 18(1) of the Treaty, which gives every citizen of the Union the right to enter, move and reside freely in the territory of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The same right, with a similar wording, is conferred on the European citizen by Article 45(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this seems to us very significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, these rights are of a constituent and not a declarative nature. In other words they are acquired regardless of any permission granted by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Commission’s proposal, which we consider to be a genuine step forward. The movement of the Union’s citizens amongst the Member States should be carried out <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis </span>in conditions similar to those of the citizens of a particular State.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, Madam President, the Union’s citizens have taken this principle on board much more quickly and thoroughly than their governments. They have taken it on board and they exercise it. I can assure you that in my part of the Union, on the coast where I spend several days, there are many European citizens residing illegally who simply come and go between their two houses, one in their country of origin and one in my country, whenever they want and without filling out any papers. It cannot be demonstrated whether these people have spent the last six months in their house, because sometimes it is 60 km from the neighbouring country. The euro will make this even easier and more possible and I hope that progress can be made within the Commission. Therefore, my group has presented amendments that intend, once and for all, to end the consideration of the economic situation of people, giving priority to the condition of citizen, and to recognise that at this moment the citizens and their families are already exercising the right to free movement within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the directive is to give more content to EU citizenship and to increase people’s freedom of movement within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal would mean a consolidation of the present multiplicity of regulations, directives and judgments in this area. In this way, the state of the law would become clearer and less ambiguous. Clear legislation would, at the same time, mean that it would be easier to overcome many of the practical obstacles to people’s freedom of movement that still exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group fully supports the principle of non-discrimination whereby EU citizens from other Member States are, as far as possible, treated according to the same rules as citizens of one’s own country. This directive is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, however, support the progressive definition of the family incorporated into the proposal. On a general note, I should like to state straight away that the intention behind the proposal is not to lay down a definition of the family. The intention is, quite basically, to preserve family unity. The discussion surrounding the definition of the family ought not therefore to distract attention from the purpose of the proposal and the positive consequences of the directive’s being adopted, namely a strengthening of the basis of the rule governing freedom of movement, an increase in the mobility of the labour force and, of course, the preservation of family unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then the amendments adopted in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have improved the original text considerably, providing greater legal certainty for workers and protecting them from the dangers of illegal immigration. Of course, European citizens should be protected from these dangers too. Certainly, a great deal remains to be done, as Mrs Karamanou and Mr Medina Ortega have made clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In addressing the expectations of family members who wish to live outside their own country, we have been working, not least, towards a genuine increase in civil liberties, eliminating discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation or form of cohabitation. We are convinced that, just as rights such as the right to divorce or to have an abortion are ingrained in the psyche of the majority of Europeans, so there is also a clear need to make effective the right of those who wish to live in a country other than their own, who wish to live alone or with a same-sex partner or to build a family without being forced to marry.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether the Council will decide or be able to preserve the political and cultural balance of Parliament’s decisions, whether it will endorse the report in the form adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, but we are sure that, should it fail to do so, it would be acting against the wishes of the majority of the Union’s citizens, as Mrs Terrón i Cusí has said, with the danger of widening the gap between institutions and people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While we often hear that the European Union wants to proceed with integration too quickly in other areas, this is typically a matter that people think should have been settled long ago. In fact people often think that it has already been settled, and they are then disappointed to find out that free movement is not as free as they thought.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about a Swede who wants to go and live and work in Italy, for example. This is now being simplified. Now I know that some Members of this Parliament, and particularly some Member States, think that this is about migration. I find that rather far-fetched. It is mainly about the free movement of EU citizens and only concerns people from third countries if they are married to or are in long-term relationships with EU citizens. So let us keep it in perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of this is naturally the fact that many people wanting to travel within the EU or who want to go and live in another country will not want to do this on their own but with their families or their partners. A great deal has been said about this in the report, the definition has been broadened and my group is satisfied with that. I conclude from Mr Pirker’s amendments and comments, however, that the definition remains extremely controversial. Marriage – we think that this is logical; the person’s spouse must be allowed to accompany them. We also think registered partnerships are surmountable; the person’s registered partner must also be allowed to accompany them. We have difficulty with long-term relationships, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to quote Mr Pirker, to show that I have been listening to him closely. He said: ‘We must distance ourselves from the idea that only a few people know what the definition of ‘family’ is.’ I agree with this wholeheartedly. I think that the most important thing is that people are committed to each other, that people want to take responsibility for each other, that people want to care for each other, and I think that it is therefore absurd that we want to disrupt family life because there is a certain official signature missing. You can also look at alternatives; how long people have been living together, for example. There are alternatives; the most important thing is that people are committed to each other, that they have a family life. Perhaps there is an official signature missing, but let us, as the European Union, see what we can do about it, not disrupt family life because there is a signature missing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is now to be given concrete shape in the proposal to give EU citizens the right of free movement and residence. This right is, and I quote: ‘becoming an integral part of the legal heritage of every citizen of the European Union’, according to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely what heritage does the Commission mean here? I find this pronouncement just as surprising as the term ‘European citizenship’. Because a Dutch person can go and work in France more easily, he suddenly feels like a European citizen. But no, he is still a Dutch person working in France. From a practical point of view it is a good and even modernising proposal. It will eliminate a lot of red tape and uncontrollable rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are two points on which I believe the Commission is encroaching too far on the Member States’ decision-making authority. Firstly in article 25, in which a host country is prohibited from issuing an expulsion order when the person concerned has obtained a permanent right of residence. Then in article 30, paragraph 2, which states that a person may resubmit a request for admission no more than two years after expulsion. That is really badly thought through.</p>

In actual fact, I have taken the floor not least in order to present to the rapporteur, both in words and on paper, the Transnational Radical Party’s petition, signed by 1122 people of 30 different nationalities, who are calling for full respect for the free movement of persons within the European Union in order to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to say, in particular, to the rapporteur, Mr Santini, and Mr Pirker – who appears to see in some of the amendments and sections which have been included by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs the desire to use the directive on free movement to impose a single family model throughout Europe – that this accusation is unfounded, and the texts they adopted prove it. What we are trying to do is not impose a single family model unduly but ensure that, with regard to the free movement of persons, with regard to European legislation, therefore, there is no difference in treatment, no discrimination on the basis of the fact that some couples are recognised to take a particular form, to be same-sex or heterosexual couples. This is our request. We do not think that in providing for the free movement of persons within the European Union we would automatically be introducing same-sex marriages throughout Europe, but if same-sex marriages are recognised in one country, when the same-sex couple moves to another country, its rights in terms of free movement – not in terms of all family rights – should be recognised. This is the point, and that is why I am asking the Members of the other groups not to remove the phrase ‘irrespective of sex’. The objection has been raised that it is unnecessary, that it is superfluous. We are not lawyers or barristers. We simply believe that this phrase, this expression should be preserved in the text. If it then proves to be superfluous, so much the better. Therefore: free movement irrespective of sex of persons who have entered into marriage or unmarried partnerships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also recommended at that time that, in order to deal with the obstacles still hampering EU citizens’ exercise of freedom of movement and residence, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing today should be adopted as rapidly as possible. By reworking existing texts, this proposal attempted to introduce the much -needed streamlining by combining in a single legal instrument the right to free movement and residence in the European area, and enshrine, specifically, the right of permanent residence at the end of four years of continuous residence. This is a welcome proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of our rapporteur, Mr Santini – and very good work it is – has helped to introduce into this proposal a set of contributions that I believe are extremely positive. There are, nevertheless, two areas that have already been mentioned in this debate, which still pose problems. They concern the definition of the family, an excessively broad definition, which appears to seek to force national legislation to recognise the definition of an unmarried partner as a family member. I believe that common sense would here dictate respect for national law and for the provisions laid down in each Member State. This also applies to the excessively broad concept of family member, on which I think it would be more reasonable to uphold the current acquis for direct descendants and direct relatives in the ascending line, contrary, therefore, to the widening put forward in the proposal. This could lead to an enormous increase in the number of people requesting family reunification. The widening of the definition proposed by Mr Santini is therefore acceptable on humanitarian grounds or on serious health grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in this Parliament must endeavour to do all we can to make it easier for European citizens to move freely around the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is somewhat anomalous that, at the moment, it is easier to move goods or capital around the European Union than it is for European citizens to move around. Mr Vitorino said at the beginning that free movement is subject to too many obstacles, and Mrs Buitenweg has just given some examples that make this obvious. If the European Union is to move closer to the citizen, we have to make it much more of a common market for people than it is at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, just as with business, in order for this to function efficiently there must be regulations. For example, British pensioners retiring to Spain and others travelling from one country to another for work must be freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive red tape. If we are to meet our target of making the European Union the most competitive economy in the world by 2010, and make it as easy for EU citizens to move from one Member State to another, as it is for US citizens to move from one state to another in the United States, then we need a free flow of European nationals moving between countries to live and work. This is about European citizens and their families being able to move around freely for work and to live; it is about teenagers getting residence permits in the country in which they have grown up.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are aspects of this report which could be misinterpreted or abused. That is why we need to build in a few extra clauses. My own government is concerned to ensure that our efforts to facilitate freedom of movement for legitimate EU nationals do not open new channels that could be exploited by criminal gangs and others.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all too aware, we live in a dangerous world. There is a minority – albeit it a very small minority - of people who may want to exploit for illegal and violent purposes the freedom of movement that this report facilitates. Therefore, we should not deny Member States the right to exclude people where there is a proven threat to national security.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a few other safeguards to protect people from the hazards of modern living. I endorse what Mr Di Lello Finuoli said: the real issue is not whether people are married or with whom they are in a lasting relationship. The Treaty guarantees the right of all citizens to family life and we, as a Parliament, are empowered to uphold this. Others have spoken about this. Legitimate and lasting partnerships should never be put under threat. On the other hand, as a balance, perhaps we need to ensure that there are safeguards to discourage the small minority who might want to use marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry. It is about free movement for people and freedom to live their lives as they wish: a free market for people, a common market for EU citizens and their families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is great news for the cause of freedom. But to listen to some, including 'conservatives' in the British Labour Government, you would think it was all about facilitating illegal immigration and terrorism. It is time for this misinformed hysteria in the UK to stop. There are sufficient safeguards in this measure and in EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">On the definition of family that EU citizens can take with them when they move, this must at least respect the law in the country of original residence. Why should a Swedish gay registered partnership lose all recognition of status when they move, for instance, to Italy? Governments, including the British one, are very happy to champion the mutual recognition principle in criminal penalties, including the European arrest warrant. Let us also champion it for freedom and rights for people, including British people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various items of legislation currently in existence are to be replaced by a single act, conditions and formalities are to be changed, and what now needs to be clarified is which restrictions are to be permissible for reasons of public order, security and health.</p>
<p class="contents">What is under discussion is the rights of EU citizens and their family members. In the deliberations in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we came up against the problem of defining what is meant by ‘family members’, and I gather from what I have heard this morning that we were not alone in doing so. How, today, do we define the family? Does ‘family’ mean father, mother, children, along with parents and grandparents? Does ‘family’ include unmarried couples of whatever gender? Here we find that the legal position varies from one Member State to another, and this, in my view, is where the Member States' subsidiarity must prevail. At the same time, it strikes me that a European definition of the family is urgently needed; after all, it is what we have to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">Who will give security to the mother or father who brings up children and is therefore unable to take up employment that could provide them with evidence of their own secure income, if the working partner dies or leaves them? In the case of residence for a period in excess of six months, they are still required to submit a declaration demonstrating their economic independence, but it is often the women whose economic-dependent status puts them in an unstable position. This means that we need an independent legal status for spouses. As I see it, a family exists when someone takes on the responsibility for educating someone else, providing for them, and caring for them. Society has to give security to those who do this, who commit and bind themselves to doing this – and I do indeed include among them those who have signed a marriage certificate.</p>

As you rightly say, Commissioner, everything else being equal, EU citizens should be able to move between Member States and the administrative burden should be reduced to that which is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome in this report the wider definition of 'family' and the importance given to the consideration of humanitarian grounds in the application of this directive. However, the wider definition of family will not be welcomed by all, and I do not share the UK Government's - my own Labour Government's - analysis of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the wider definition, we must examine our prejudice and our firmly held beliefs. This is about national citizenship and EU citizenship. We must move forward at a pace which must not be dictated by the Member State least likely to reform. The definition of 'spouse' may be clear according to the European Court of Justice, but it is up to us as legislators to redefine and to revisit definitions, especially in the light of modern family life and the diversity of durable and lasting relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, I stand here in a same-sex relationship of 20 years, yet my partner of 20 years would not be given the definition of family if he were to move with me to Brussels so I can do my work in the Parliament. I am asked to pay the same taxes, to live by the same laws, but both I and my relationship - which cannot be recognised in the United Kingdom - are denied equality. So, we encourage people either to enter into honest, durable relationships, or we encourage them to enter into marriages of convenience which would drive a coach and horses through this directive and all of its intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is either about the free movement of all of our citizens or it is not. Baroness Ludford is absolutely right. There should be a principle of mutual recognition here. I ask the PPE-DE Group to join with us, to explore the possibilities and reach a sensible compromise with the Council, recognising the modern world and affording equal rights to all of our citizens, not equal rights for some. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swiebel (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> The free movement of persons that we are discussing here is one of the core principles of the European Union, and it is odd that we are still having all manner of differences of opinion about it. The present labour market and the opportunities for study and enjoying your retirement in a country other than the one you come from call for Europe to have flexible rules. They should not hinder anyone unnecessarily. It nevertheless looks as if the Commission wants to exclude a significant group of citizens from this right, namely those citizens who want to take their families with them to another country but who are unmarried or in a registered partnership that is not recognised in the other country. For example, a French woman who is in a registered partnership cannot take the man or woman of her dreams with her to Italy because there is no such thing as a registered partnership there. Mr Pirker says that is a minor detail; to me it looks like a disaster. Even two men or two women who were married in the Netherlands or in Belgium cannot go to Greece together if one of them is going to work there. Imagine what it must feel like. In the Commission’s proposal, family members can only accompany people going to another country if they are spouses in a heterosexual marriage or if they are unmarried partners and the host country equates these couples with married partners. This approach, however, results in discrimination on the basis of nationality, something that was prohibited in the European Union a long time ago. It is an odd matter that we have to fix.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of fellow MEPs and myself have therefore submitted amendments to introduce the system of mutual recognition in this area, and these have also been accepted in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. This system ensures that all possible forms of relationship are mutually recognised by the Member States. Marriage, the registered partnership and also the de facto partnership – irrespective of their composition, in other words, irrespective of sex. Incidentally, we are not only talking about same-sex couples; a growing number of men and women choose not to marry and prefer to cohabit but without losing all their rights. Fortunately there are already eight Member States who enable their citizens to do so. This freedom of choice must not, however, be lost when these citizens cross the border. I am therefore pleased that the vast majority of this Parliament appears to support the application of the principle of mutual recognition in this area. This is a big step forward and augurs well for the coming discussions with the Council. So if that is the case, why does my group want to retain the phrase ‘irrespective of sex’? The reason for this is that our friends in the Group of the European People's Party have not been able to agree whether they are indeed willing to apply this principle of mutual recognition across the board, in other words including relationships, marriage relationships and non-marriage relationships between persons of the same sex from those countries where they are legally permitted. To us, partial equality is no equality at all. Given this doubt, there can be no harm in promoting the rights of homosexual men and women a little more in the meantime. In that respect I can only underline what Mr Cashman said, and I therefore hope that our friends in the Group of the European People's Party will be able to take the chill out of the air in the next phase of this stage in the legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must turn freedom of movement into a reality within the EU. I therefore welcome uniform regulations that may make it easier for people to move without difficulty between the various Member States of the EU. Following enlargement, it will be still more important for the rules governing freedom of movement to be clear and simple so that all EU citizens, both new and old, are aware of their rights and of the rules that apply.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to encourage increased movement within the EU, we must begin by simplifying the rules. The rules must also be generous. I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed rules that facilitate the freedom of movement of different family members. I am especially pleased that this committee has proposed extending the concept of the family. People who do not live in what, from a legal point of view, are traditional family structures must have the same right as married couples to live together in the countries of the EU. They must be entitled to feel sure that the same rights apply to us all. That is of course a challenge for many in the EU since it brings traditional thinking into question. We must nonetheless accept that challenge and the opportunity it provides, precisely because we live in a common union and wish to create a common EU citizenship. Ultimately, we are concerned here with respect and the equal value of every person. The regulations governing family issues in the EU must be generous and non-discriminatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me turn to the two controversial issues during this debate. First of all, concerning Article 2 and the concept of family, one has to recognise that harmonising the conditions of residence for European Union citizens must not result in our imposing modifications on Member State legislation defining family status. I understand this debate and the difficulty of, on the one hand, ensuring compatibility with Article 13 of the Treaty, which is the legal basis for combating discrimination, including discrimination against unmarried couples or same sex couples when, on the other hand, the Treaty excludes Family law from the scope of competences of the European Union. In this very sensitive field, the Community must respect the developments introduced in Member State legislation and must be flexible in this. There is no universal legal solution for this kind of <span class="italic">de facto</span> partnership or for registered partnerships or same sex marriages.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we should not exaggerate the extent of the practical difficulties that unmarried couples or same-sex couples encounter in exercising the right of residence. In fact, when the two people are citizens of the European Union, they both enjoy the right of residence by virtue of Article 18 of the Treaty, independently of the nature of their relationship. However, I recognise that the problem arises when one of them is a third-country national. For the time being, the Commission's proposal is to define marriage with reference to the term 'spouse', and we do not seek to define this term. In fact, at present, the legislation of only two Member States recognises union between persons of the same sex as marriage.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the case law of the Court of Justice, the term 'marriage' designates a union between persons of the opposite sex. The Commission prefers, at the present stage, to follow the case law of the Court of Justice, and to use a formula that allows progressive interpretation of this concept on the basis of future developments in the legislation of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards unmarried partners, including registered partners, the Commission also considers that the recognition of these situations will have to be made by reference to the host Member State legislation. I understand the argument of mutual recognition, but one has to be very careful when using it. The recognition for the purpose of residence of unmarried partners on the basis of the legislation of Member States of origin could pose problems to those Member States whose family legislation does not recognise these possibilities. In addition, the principle of non-discrimination requires that the host Member State treat unmarried couples of other Member States in the same way as its own nationals. I believe therefore that everyone will agree, particularly in this field, that we should not create reverse discrimination. That would be the actual outcome of such a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will follow your deliberations tomorrow and the negotiations with Council very closely. I am sure that all of you are aware of the difficulty of this debate and the different approaches of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has suggested an amendment to Article 21 concerning equal treatment which aims to exclude inactive people from social assistance during the first six months rather, than the first four years of residence, until they acquire permanent rights of residence, as provided for in the Commission's proposals. I am aware that the Commission's text needs to be adapted in the light of the recent judgment of the Court of Justice in this field, which stated that any citizen residing legally in another Member State must enjoy equal treatment with its nationals in matters of social welfare. However, despite the fact that Mr Santini's amendment goes in the right direction, it is not possible to accept it in its current formulation as it is not completely in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Justice to which I have just referred. The Commission considers it preferable to reconsider the proposal and to better scrutinise the content of the Court of Justice judgment. We will bring forward an amended proposal as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that the only problem for a couple in a registered partnership was when one of them was a foreign national. If they are both EU nationals, under Article 18, they could both independently move to another State. That is true, but what they lose is the status of registered partnership and the tax or social rights that go with that - for instance, the right to be recognised as next of kin if one of them is in hospital. His answer does not address that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just an immigration question, it is also a question of recognition as a family. I do not think he can just get around that, and I believe the mutual recognition argument has strong force, as in other sectors like criminal law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
