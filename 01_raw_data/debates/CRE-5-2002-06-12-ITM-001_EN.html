<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I shall comment very briefly on the issue raised by Mr Van Orden. This Parliament is well aware that the Council has attended to the issue of Zimbabwe on various occasions and that this matter was addressed at the Barcelona European Council. I have been following the matter very closely and I can tell you that a General Affairs Council will be held next Monday. Let us hope that we can deal with the matter at Minister of Foreign Affairs level and should it prove necessary or appropriate, it could then be raised at the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Seville European Council, Mr President, from 21 to 22 June the second and last European Council of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union will take place in Seville. Five basic issues will be addressed at this Council: the process of economic reforms, as a follow-up to the Barcelona European Council; the current state of negotiations on enlargement, a process on which we have made substantial progress; issues of Justice and Home Affairs, in particular immigration policy; the debate on the future of Europe, with a report from the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing; and the issues of greatest concern in the context of the CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy).</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now briefly discuss the issues I have mentioned. I shall start with the economic issues – the follow-up to the Spring European Council. This follow-up will be one of the fundamental elements of this forthcoming European Council, since the Spring European Council laid down a programme and a follow-up for certain issues and established a set of tasks to be revised in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">Barcelona represented the continuation of the process inaugurated at the Lisbon European Council, which focused on a programme of economic reforms in the aim of making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive region in the world in the context of the new economy of the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">In Seville, therefore, and as a follow-up to Barcelona, the following issues will be examined: firstly, Ecofin – which is due to meet on 20 June, before the European Council – will present a final report on the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines. The Presidency intends to present a report on the current state of work on the tax package, which includes a range of initiatives on savings tax, energy tax and cooperation with tax authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of 'corporate governance' (the governance of businesses) will also be addressed. For this reason, the report by the high level working group on company law must discuss three issues: the role of non-executive directors and of boards of directors, company directors’ pay and the board of directors’ responsibility for preparing information about the company’s finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues left pending from the Barcelona European Council and which will be addressed by the Seville Council are: the simplification and improvement of regulations – known as 'better regulation'; economic services of general interest – the Commission will also present the report that has been requested of it; energy supply – on which it will present another report; telecommunications, education, research; the outermost regions and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major issue that I announced was that of negotiations on enlargement. Unless you ask me to provide further information, Mr President, I would prefer not to dwell on the issue of enlargement, since today a substantive debate is going to be held on the matter. Therefore, as enlargement will be the subject of a specifically scheduled statement this very evening, I think we could keep the debate short and leave this issue for later.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues of Justice and Home Affairs have been one of the main priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Union. In Seville we will be pressing ahead on these issues in four main areas: firstly, a review of Community asylum and immigration policy will be undertaken – basically a review of the Tampere commitments – as well as an assessment of the situation and a clear programme to fulfil the commitments that we adopted in 1999 during the Finnish Presidency, as a consequence of the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs issues, formalised in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Heads of State and Government will be discussing a global plan to combat illegal immigration. Then there will be a discussion of a programme and a policy on protecting the Union’s external borders. Lastly, a debate will be held on integrating migration policy into the Union’s external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first issue I mentioned, the European Council, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere Council and of following Councils, is going to urge the Council to approve, within the deadlines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the necessary legislative instruments to adopt a common asylum and immigration policy. This policy must respect the balance between a set of principles, such as the protection of refugees, the Union and the Member States’ ability to receive asylum seekers and the integration of legal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the negotiations currently underway on adopting a common policy in the field of asylum and legal immigration will be given a boost if at the same time the Union develops a common policy to combat illegal immigration, which produces effective results in the short and medium term. For these reasons, on 28 February of this year, the Council approved its plan to combat illegal immigration. This will also be addressed by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to vigilance and closer monitoring of the borders and of border crossing points, one of the plan’s aims is to prevent the illegal crossing of the external borders of the Member States of the Union, whilst at the same time ensuring that asylum seekers can exercise their right to ask for international protection. In this context, the communication that the Commission presented recently, entitled "Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union" takes on particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the basis of the agreement reached at the Laeken Summit, in Seville the European Council will demonstrate its desire to integrate immigration policy much more deeply into the Union’s external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principle of external action in the field of immigration and asylum with the countries of origin and of transit must be a global, integrated and balanced approach, which uses all the Community and Member States’ instruments in a coordinated way to establish a relationship of cooperation with a view to ensuring the joint management of migratory flows, and to address the underlying causes of these flows and of poverty, in order to incorporate this dimension into development aid policy. Something else that will be raised is the development of an external strategy for areas in the immediate vicinity of borders to cooperate in the management and control of migratory flows.</p>
<p class="contents">The other major package of issues, to which I referred at the beginning, is everything that concerns institutional affairs, the debate on the future of Europe and the reform of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There are essentially two matters of an institutional nature, on which we shall focus: the debate on the future of Europe and the reform of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first issue, the Convention on the future of Europe held its inaugural sitting on 28 February, as you will remember, because this took place in the seat of the European Parliament, and before Seville, the Convention will already have held five plenary sessions. Furthermore, I think we can draw some preliminary conclusions from the debates that have taken place to date.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the majority of the members of the Convention have shown themselves to be in favour of going more deeply into the process of European integration in a realistic way, in particular with regard to the distribution of competences. On the other hand, and in relation to the works of the Convention, the Presidium has agreed to set up six working groups, which are to present their conclusions between September and November.</p>
<p class="contents">In Seville, in line with the provisions of the Laeken declaration, the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, will present an oral report on the progress achieved in the Convention’s works.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the Council, and in accordance with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council, the Presidency will present a report in Seville on improving its functioning and on reforms to make it more effective on the basis of the report submitted by the Secretary General of the Council, in the aim of ensuring greater transparency in the legislative process and in which practical measures for its adoption will be put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, of course, to clarify something that to me seems obvious, but which bears repeating, and that is that these Council reforms only refer to internal reforms, to internal organisation, and that in no case does the Council intend to address issues that require a reform of primary law, because this, of course, is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the European Convention preparing the Intergovernmental Conference. The Council will, therefore, be considering a set of practical reforms that will make the work of the European Council more rapid and more dynamic and which, furthermore, as you would expect, move towards the system employed by the Councils that support the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Council can now begin to attempt to simplify its administrative tasks so as to prepare the Union for a scenario in which, following enlargement, we will have 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the European Council, as you would expect and as is the norm, will have to deal with the field of external relations focussing essentially on the following issues: firstly, the situation in the Middle East. On this matter the European Union will maintain its efforts to achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict, by condemning the use of violence and by promoting conciliation as an instrument of joint action geared towards making progress in the economic, political and security spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, with regard to the crisis of the Church of the Nativity, the Council has been pleased at the resolution of this crisis in line with the memorandum of understanding signed by both sides. The Palestinians affected by the agreement have been transferred to various Member States of the Union – Spain, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Portugal – to be accepted, for humanitarian reasons, in line with the common position reached by the Council on 21 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this common position underlines the commitment of the European Union to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East. I therefore believe that, in the context of these recent actions, the European Council will study the situation and will try once again to give impetus to the latest initiatives to be put forward by the High Representative, Mr Solana, for a Peace Conference to take place as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council will study developments in issues of security and defence policy, in particular, in relation to the fight against terrorism and the follow-up to the Laeken mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the European Council will be forced to deal with the conflict between India and Pakistan to which I shall now specifically refer. Despite having historically been strictly bilateral, this conflict today contains a new dimension, which transcends the sub-regional consequences to become a potential factor for destabilisation for the entire Asian Continent and for the whole world<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Given<span class="italic"> </span>the possibility of a fourth India-Pakistan conflagration, which could spiral out of control towards nuclear escalation, the international community must react unambiguously. At the end of last year, following the tragic attacks by terrorists on elected representatives in Srinagar and New Delhi, the Presidency held talks with both governments to urge both sides to prevent a military escalation, to reopen political dialogue and to find political formulas to resolve the problem of Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">After the encouraging speech given by President Musharraf on 12 January, New Delhi reacted with a sense of historical opportunity to this conciliatory gesture by Pakistan and agreed to stop military mobilisation. Nevertheless, further devastating attacks – in Kaluchak and in Srinagar – border skirmishes and the re-emergence of the dialectic of confrontation, with the recent missile tests by Pakistan that matched those by India in January, have brought both armies to the brink of war.</p>
<p class="contents">We only have to remember the tone of the disappointing speech by the President of Pakistan on 27 May and the cold rigidity of India’s response to the calls for containment made at the highest political levels. Here we must recall the visits to New Delhi and Islamabad by the Secretary of State, Mr Powell, by Commissioner Patten, by the Foreign Secretary, Mr Straw, the calls by Presidents Chirac and Putin and, lastly, the tour currently being undertaken by the United States’ Defence Secretary, Mr Rumsfeld.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has to date wished to maintain a position that is as even-handed as possible in this conflict, insisting on the need for both sides to make efforts to reconcile their positions. This was the idea that inspired the Presidency declaration on this matter, issued on 21 May. Despite the undeniable efforts by the Pakistanis against the hideouts of Al-Qaida cells, the international community must not tolerate any link between the operation of the nuclear umbrella and political cross-border claims. For this reason, Pakistan’s commitment against organised terror must be total and unconditional and not selective in its efforts or in the deadlines it sets.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, specifically, to remind you that, at the General Affairs Council held last Monday, the ministers agreed to convey a new message, this time not in the form of a Council declaration, but in the form of a press communiqué, with the President of the General Affairs Council, Mr Piqué, informing the media, in order to encourage both sides at a time when we are already seeing signs of relaxation, such as the fact that India has already opened its air space to civilian Pakistani flights and the fact that currently there seems to be a more relaxed atmosphere, in which the alert has been withdrawn along the militarised lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget the European victims of the attacks that were carried out in April and May in Islamabad. Let us remember the bomb set off in the Protestant church of a diplomatic neighbourhood and, in Karachi, the suicide attack on a bus containing French military advisers and technical specialists, as tragic proof that innocent EU citizens have not been excluded from terrorist madness in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the Presidency considers that the strategy of diplomatic monitoring of both sides must be maintained, albeit whilst now calling, with greater firmness, if necessary, for new gestures of conciliation by both sides which will satisfy the legitimate demands – especially by India – for terrorism to be firmly dealt with. New Delhi and Islamabad must realise that the international community does not – and will not – understand if either of the two countries resorts to military force. Since 17 May, more than 60 people have died at the India-Pakistan border; a million soldiers from the two sides are watching each other from the line of control, awaiting orders to start a conflict which, if it happens, – whatever its final outcome may be – will mean desolation and death for the population of both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as I have already said, the European Union will continue to help ensure that both sides understand the need to keep the paths of dialogue open, in order to prevent a military scenario arising, the consequences of which would have a tragic affect on the entire continent of Asia. I would say that next week, in Seville, the message of the Heads of State and Government will be along these lines, in the hope that the already nascent actions to decrease the tension that are taking place will increase with every passing day and that we will be able, at the end of next week, to see a situation that is calmer than the one we saw a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude this statement by expressing my hope and my belief that the Seville European Council will be a good ending to the term of the Spanish Presidency, during which none of us have spared any effort to push forwards our common idea of Europe and to make the motto that we proposed at the beginning of our Presidency – 'more Europe' – a reality.</p>

To end this digression into foreign policy, on which, I repeat, I am in complete agreement with Mr de Miguel, I would like to call upon you to pay attention to potential conflicts too, to growing tensions such as the situation following the elections on the island of Madagascar, which is becoming increasingly perilous and which warrants our close attention precisely because we have greater influence and greater capacity for action before conflict breaks out.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to today’s subject, I will just go briefly through the matters which will be debated at the Seville European Conference. I have to say that my task has been made much easier by the first-rate work of the current Council Presidency. I am extremely grateful to the Spanish Presidency, for we have worked both well and hard.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a critical time for the future of the institutions: the Convention is working on a new political and institutional framework for the Union and enlargement is approaching.</p>
<p class="contents">At Seville we shall report on the candidate countries' progress in implementing the acquis. They have come a long way and we are continuing to work with them under the special programme for them. Our final opinion on each candidate country will be issued before the October European Council in Brussels. The roadmap we drew up has been adhered to and everything is in place for the final decision. There are real grounds for optimism and I continue to hope that the EU will have up to ten new members in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many issues to be discussed at Seville, but today, before you, the Members of the European Parliament, I want to concentrate on two in particular: how the EU is run and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention is up and running, the debate is lively and there are plenty of ideas and proposals. That was to be expected, given that we are adopting an innovative approach rather than working through the usual diplomatic channels. President Giscard d'Estaing will be reporting on the first stage of the Convention's work at Seville and we shall pay careful attention to what he has to say. At Seville, however – and this is the main point of my speech – we will not just be talking about how to govern the Union in future: we will be discussing – and deciding – how we can improve the running of the Union now. We cannot sit still and wait for the reform of the Treaties: we must take advantage right now of all the possibilities the existing Treaties offer to improve our running of the Union and our organisational model. The Convention is working on policies for the future but we must also use the – albeit limited – instruments we have to hand to tackle today's problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what links the proposals on Council reform made by Mr Solana in his report and the proposals of the Commission on better regulation. Mr Corbett's proposals on the reform of Parliament that you are discussing in this part-session are also similar in this regard. These proposals involve all the institutions in different ways, and all the institutions will therefore have to work together to achieve the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with what is known as ‘better regulation’. This was the idea behind the White Paper on European Governance: to exploit all the opportunities available in the present legal framework in order to improve the legislative and decision-making process. The enormous participation in the debate on the White Paper and your own contributions – especially the report by Mrs Kaufmann – show that this was the right strategy. The system must therefore be leaner, more transparent and more efficient. We must show that we are able to satisfy the demand for greater accountability and for more proportionality in the exercise of the powers conferred on the Council, Parliament and the Commission by the Treaties. Moreover, we must gear our action to a new goal: the goal of giving more substance to the concept of citizenship and making our fellow citizens' relationship with the Union more transparent, more direct and more tangible.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I presented our project to the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, but I would like to go over certain crucial points again now. Firstly, we are proposing to improve and simplify European legislation by reviewing the whole cycle of the legislative process, beginning with the exercise of the right of initiative. There are three prongs to this project: laying down clear rules on consultation, assessing the impact of decisions and improving legislative technique. Our drafting of legislative proposals must be based on wider consultation of all parties concerned and more exhaustive analysis of the economic, social and environmental impact, in accordance with the decisions of the Gothenburg European Council, and this must be done without introducing unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Good Community regulation also means acting in full accordance with the original spirit of the Treaties. This means, in particular, making use of framework directives, which are one of the most effective instruments for increasing compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also time to review the implementation of our policies, because implementation is the stage that affects the citizens most directly. Transparency and democratic accountability demand that each of the institutions refocus its efforts on its core tasks. In this way, we can start right now to see how the Community method can be revamped in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress once again that all this does not just apply to the Commission. All the institutions must be involved if we really want to get useful results: the institutions have no option but to work together. Lastly, the institutions themselves must return to their core tasks. Each must therefore take on clear responsibilities so that we can complete an interinstitutional agreement by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Solana report, the Council has also launched a new debate on similar issues and tabled practical proposals for internal organisational reform which do not involve amending the Treaties. The Commission wholeheartedly supports the Council's reform efforts. I can only welcome the fact that the Council is looking to draw a distinction in its internal organisation between the procedures applicable to its legislative function and those applicable to its purely administrative functions. I also support the points contained in the proposal on continuity of work, the need to improve internal coordination and the possibility of reducing the number of Council configurations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all recommendations which simplify their and our work. These efforts will help us to tackle the problems that the forthcoming enlargement will bring for the working of our institutions. In my view, an objective of such importance can only be addressed through a coordinated approach involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council. We must act together, calmly but resolutely, to move beyond ‘better regulation’ to achieve ‘better organisation’ of all the institutions. The Commission is ready to play its part in this joint endeavour. Better organisation means more speed, more coordination and less red tape. It means giving up long-established but outdated positions in the interests of working faster and better than before, despite the increased complexity of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said at the beginning of my speech, the most burning issue to be dealt with by the European Council is immigration. It is worth repeating that there is no question of proposing solutions that are incompatible with the fundamental values of our Union. Instead, we must promote a model of integration that can combine freedom with our citizens' legitimate demands for security.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already expressed my support for the Presidency's decision to put the issue of immigration high on the Seville agenda. In the eyes of most of our citizens, immigration is becoming increasingly linked with requirements for their protection in the area of freedom, security and justice that we are trying to build together. There are a variety of reasons for this and they have been somewhat accentuated by the events of September 11 too. We must address these issues without demonising them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussions now under way on legal immigration and the right of asylum could break down if we do not take on board our fellow citizens' concerns about illegal immigration. At Tampere, we agreed on a number of objectives that are still valid today. We even have before us suitable proposals for achieving those objectives such as those set out in the Commission communication on illegal immigration, which formed the basis for the Council's Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Others concern the management of our external borders and readmission policies. The political signals we have received recently are quite clear. We cannot put the issue of security on the back burner, and we cannot let people think that a return to nationalistic solutions can provide a valid answer to transnational phenomena that overwhelm the capacity and scope for action of individual States and can therefore be tackled and managed only at EU level. The problem is not just combating illegal trafficking: we must also lay the foundations for the full integration of lawful immigrants into our societies and regulate the flow of the immigrants we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Even enlargement is presented as a threat by some because of the issue of immigration. But why – I ask myself, ladies and gentlemen – would the citizens of the candidate countries leave their countries and turn their lives upside down just when membership of the European Union is offering them brighter prospects of prosperity? Was the same thing not said when Spain and Portugal joined and was the same thing not said about Italy when the European Community was first created?</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act quickly on various fronts. Most importantly, we must tighten controls on the Union’s external borders in accordance with the recent proposals put forward by the Commission and the Italian Government. I trust that the European Council will decide to bring together border police representatives to work out what measures and instruments are needed in the immediate term to launch these initiatives. External border controls must also be linked to our good-neighbour policy. This seeks to develop special relations and mutual trust between the Union and all countries on its borders, especially following enlargement, with a view, not least, to undertaking joint measures to combat illegal immigration. In the Euro-Mediterranean context, we have already launched initiatives together with Morocco to devise an overall approach to the issue of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must step up the adoption and implementation of measures on asylum, not least in order to give practical substance to the concept of European citizenship and certain principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, ladies and gentlemen, will not suffice unless it goes hand in hand with a proper cooperation and development policy and the systematic use of all the instruments available to us: a policy to tackle the causes of migration, bilateral agreements and readmission agreements. We will soon be putting forward practical proposals on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will ask the Seville Council to take appropriate decisions on these points quickly, with the common sense and responsibility that we demonstrated at Brussels and Ghent last autumn. The two topics I have concentrated on today are of crucial importance for us at this time. Making our institutions more democratic, transparent and accountable is a response to our fellow citizens' demand for a more effective Europe that is more in touch with their everyday concerns. The issue of immigration highlights the very reason for European integration: to build a Europe that is prosperous, just and secure.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Spanish Presidency has done a good job so far, but the Seville Summit will be the deciding factor in our final judgment of it. Mr President-in-Office, may I make a point of reiterating what the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission just said, that is, that our group expects a high-ranking political working party of all three institutions to be set up in Seville to advise us and reach conclusions as to how we can improve our legislation so that, as the President of the Commission said, we can reach an institutional agreement by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister and President-in-Office José María Aznar has promised this to Parliament and I really do implore you to pass a resolution for us in Seville setting up this sort of political working party. If you do, our final judgment of the Spanish Presidency will be even more positive than it has been so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the reform of the Council is concerned, I quite understand your reticence, Mr President-in-Office, and I assume it is because you do not as yet have a brief to discuss it. I am sure I am right in assuming that the Spanish Presidency will do everything in its power to ensure that the Council as a legislative body is distinguished from the Council as an executive body and that, where it acts as legislator, it does so transparently. This is what we expect from Seville. You said that the president of the convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, would be submitting a report. I would be delighted if all the governments of the Member States of the European Union were to follow suit, if their representatives to the convention also reported back to their cabinets and governments in the Member States of the European Union, in order to ensure there is direct feedback, just as we do at parliamentary level. I should like on behalf of our group to make it perfectly clear that the debates in the Council today and at the summit in Seville must be predicated on strengthening the European Community, because we need strong European institutions and must not slip back into intergovernmentalism. I say this in the light of my visit to the United States over the last two days. Unless we act as a European Union, and we are hardly even perceived as a European Union in America; unless we strengthen the European Union, then we shall lose more and more clout internationally, which is why our objective must be to strengthen the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge the Spanish Presidency's determined approach to the fight against terrorism. Our perception in Europe is different from the perception in the United States. The United States feels it is at war, because it is the first time it has been attacked on home territory. We have to understand that and we must do everything we can in Europe to help destroy terrorist networks. But we also have to say that terrorism and the fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to violate human rights, be it in Africa, Chechnya or anywhere else. And we must make a clear distinction between terrorists, on the one hand, and the Arab and Islamic world on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important that the European Union continue in its endeavours to help broker peace in the Middle East. That we say to the Israelis, you have the right to live within secure borders and anyone who attacks those secure borders must be prepared to meet decisive resistance. But we must also say to the Palestinians that they have their dignity and the right to live within secure borders in a Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your efforts in the fight against terrorism, we welcome your efforts to set up a common European border police to protect the external borders of the European Union and we hope that Seville will bring results. We recognise that Spain's efforts on the Sixth Research Framework Programme have been a huge success and we also hope – and this will be discussed more thoroughly this afternoon – to confirm the timetable for the enlargement of the European Union. I can only reiterate what President Prodi said: that we, the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission, the European institutions, are encouraging the countries of central Europe to conclude negotiations on the basis of the acquis communautaire, so that we can achieve results within the planned time frame and the countries of central Europe which sign accession agreements, together with Malta and – hopefully – Cyprus, can take part in the next European elections. We, the European Parliament, we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, see ourselves as the champion of the nations seeking to join the European Union and my only request, from the bottom of my heart, is that we all help to keep to this timetable.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Díez González (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span><span class="bold"> </span>Mr President, as made clear in the speeches both by the Presidency and by those party spokespeople who have spoken, Seville will be the last summit of the Spanish Presidency and, although this is not the time to draw up the final balance sheet, this is the time to take a brief look at how it has performed its duties and to see whether we are likely to pass or even to get a good mark.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be said that these five months have been characterised by an excessive fuss about most of the issues set as priorities for the Presidency’s term in office. There has been a great deal of fuss about enlargement, about immigration, about Mediterranean policy, about fisheries policy and the reform of agricultural policy, about external policy, about transatlantic relations, etc. It cannot be denied, Mr President, that we have talked about everything: sustainable development, the spirit of Lisbon, the institutionalisation of the Union, the outermost regions... but if we look at the progress that has been made on any of the issues I have just mentioned – we will reach the conclusion that a major imbalance has been created between what is said and what is done. As they say, Mr President, there has been much ado about nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that on some issues – perhaps on many of them – the Presidency has alibis, but the fact is that we are approaching the end of the Presidency with a more complicated agenda than when we started and with more confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of immigration and asylum, for example, for more than a month, we have been repeating, ad nauseam, the conclusions of the Tampere Council; commitments that the Council has been unable to fulfil due to a lack of political will. Nothing new is being said. Everything has already been said and agreed upon but there has been such a fanfare of trumpets that you would think we had come up with something new for the Seville Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to employment policy, all I can fairly say is that Barcelona threw the spirit of Lisbon off course. No account was taken of the fact that Lisbon’s strategic objective was not only to create a more prosperous and competitive economic area; the other objectives were full employment and greater social cohesion, and this is where a step backwards has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we say about the major challenge laid down by the Swedish Presidency: sustainable development? This is a representative example of what has not been achieved. The resolution of the Barcelona Summit mentioned sustainability 103 times. Are there any higher offers?</p>
<p class="contents">The Valencia Summit was a success in that it took place. I know that the climate in the Middle East was not the most favourable, but we were not even able to press ahead with one of the few tangible priorities of the Spanish Presidency, the Euro-Mediterranean Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to transatlantic relations, it has already been said – Mr Poettering said this himself – that we have never had so many ongoing disputes with the USA, such as, for example, the trade and industry issues, the failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the divergent positions on the Middle East, the belligerent position of the USA towards the International Criminal Court, which makes them feel that they can threaten us with intervening if a member of the American military is put on trial in the Netherlands. It looks as if the States no longer respect us on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, with a comment on the institutional reforms: the world has become a very complicated place, globalisation requires increasingly strong global institutions and policies that are increasingly close to the citizens, but the Spanish Presidency – and it genuinely pains me to say this – has been characterised by contradictory and misguided responses to these challenges and in this area: more renationalisation, less European government; and this will not help us to solve any of the problems facing Europe. Cutting back on the powers of our common institutions is a defensive reaction that can only lead to failure. This is, Mr President, the most sordid form of nationalism, and 'More Europe' means less nationalism, both of the old style and of<span class="italic"> </span>the<span class="italic"> </span>new<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it could be said that, to date, we are quite dissatisfied, but that we would like nothing more than to change our minds and, in the days remaining, in the final stretch, for you to surprise us and for more light to appear and for some shadows to vanish.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to President Aznar on 16 January in this very Parliament, I should like nothing more than to be able to congratulate you when it is all over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, first of all, I should share a saying with you. Pessimists are usually right, but progress is made thanks to optimists. I think this is the attitude we should adopt with regard to the forthcoming Council in Seville. There are a number of crucial points on the agenda for that summit. Topics on which clear and tangible progress must actually be made are the immigration issue, enlargement and the Council reforms. As enlargement will be debated this afternoon, I shall only make a brief reference to it now.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past six months, a number of government leaders, including Prime Ministers Aznar and Blair, have come up with proposals on immigration. Remarkably, they have not done so before now. Where were they in the past three years following the agreements of Tampere? Indeed, since then, the Council has made little real progress following the highly verbose phraseology of space and freedom, security and justice. If the Council is so keen to keep this responsibility all to itself – after all, we as MEPs are only being heard out of politeness – it should also render account of its own role and responsibility. In fact, I should at this stage share with you an embarrassing example of the Council’s tardiness: the package of measures which this House adopted at the proposal of Mr Graham Watson around Christmas in order to find an effective European answer to the terrorist threats. The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs have still not taken an effective decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The immigration proposals, as these reach us via the media, very much smack of a cosy PR exercise between Great Britain and Spain. In all honesty, who expects a great deal of good to come from Her Majesty’s ship ‘Ark Royal’ sailing up and down the Mediterranean? Surely this will not be the ark that immigrants are waiting to board? No, we would be much better off looking into realistic, effective and, at the same time, forceful measures in order to achieve a common asylum and immigration policy. I would refer to the ideas of the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, on this matter. A number of his points have already been raised at Laeken, but unfortunately, they were apparently surplus to requirements at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We must set up a true common asylum and immigration policy. Crucial in this is, first of all, that immigration policy is linked to an integration policy and anti-discrimination policy. These are not self-contained issues. When a policy of this kind is set up, a great deal of attention should go to fundamental rights and freedoms. Central is therefore also parliamentary control and co-legislation. In addition, the Commission’s right of initiative and a majority decision-making process in the Council should not be absent; that much is obvious. In the policy itself, the focus should be on the fight against human trafficking and illegal immigration. The President of the Commission mentioned it a moment ago: plans are already drawn up for illegal immigration. What is needed, is implementation rather than clever new ideas. This can only be done properly if the external borders are closely monitored, whereby one common European border police force must be able to assist, where necessary. In the light of this, I should, in fact, share with you my serious concerns regarding control of the future eastern borders. As far as I am concerned, no compromises should be made in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you will have noticed that I do not always have a high opinion of the functioning of the Council. I am therefore delighted to see that various proposals will be submitted in Seville which relate to the Council’s reform. For the Liberal Group, it is of huge importance that the Council should, crucially, be democratic, open and subject to supervision. This is why I call for the Community method across the board and for Council meetings, in which the Council acts as co-legislator, to be open to the public. In fact, this openness should start with enlargement, so that everyone can see what the Council’s common position is on the matter. As things stand at the moment, we are receiving such unsatisfactory – and some would claim coloured – information from the Council and also from the Commission, in fact, that one would almost consider hiring independent experts in order to find out what the true state of affairs in the candidate countries is or how the negotiations are really going. You will really have to give us, along with the European citizen, better information, so that we can continue to trust in the role of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I should like to say that I am not so fond of pessimists, but the saying is there for a reason. They are sometimes right. We could say, nothing will come of Seville, but we will not. I should like to say to the Spanish Presidency: show your bright, optimistic side. Do what you are good at: grab the bull by the horns and you will have us on your side. Pave the way for real progress, for that is what people want and what is desperately needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, to do that it needs a commitment to sustainability in all aspects of its work, and that includes integration of social and environmental factors into its economic and trade policies. We have to remember that without a healthy environment we have no sound foundation for our economies. So we trust that will be remembered, as promised by Commission President Prodi, in the better governance arrangements and we are looking forward to the policy proofing and the impact on the social and environmental dimensions he mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">To be credible at that sustainability summit, we also need to demonstrate that we understand the importance of development and its link to certain aspects of immigration policy. I was pleased to hear the Spanish minister referring to issues about deep poverty. That is in marked contrast to what we have been hearing from the Spanish Prime Minister over the last few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union wants a mobile, flexible workforce. It is a priority in our employment policy, so why do we insist on making legal immigration for all skilled sectors virtually impossible? What we have been hearing over the last few weeks and today sounds to us simply like moving the walls of fortress Europe and looking for stronger building materials, including using the idea of economic clout – such as development aid – in our attempts to have other countries police their borders more effectively to stop people leaving. The countries of eastern and central Europe are joining the Union to escape that sort of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned at some of the proposed reforms to the Council's inner workings – the Development Council, for example, is to be absorbed into a wider grouping. But we welcome the reassurance we have heard today that the reforms will not touch matters for the IGC and the Convention, because it is essential that the Council does not become the legislature and executive and break the current balance between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the commitment to greater transparency and trust that this will not just be for the Council but for the public as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jové Peres (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, although I greatly admire Mr de Miguel, I am sorry that he is replacing Mr Aznar here today. I am sorry because it is Mr Aznar who has undoubtedly been the architect of the first variable-geometry Presidency of the European Union. I have looked through my notes and read the initial speeches of the Presidency and I have been surprised at the tenuous link between his statement of priorities and the activities of the European Union in this six-month term.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether this is a subtle strategy to achieve the unstated objective of reaching a common position on legal and illegal immigration or whether it is an objective devised to cover up other gaps and camouflage itself in the wave of xenophobia sweeping Europe. The Seville conclusions should not focus solely on policing and crime-reduction, but should include the beneficial effects of immigration. I hope that immigration policies that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that ensure equal treatment for immigrants, will be promoted in Seville. Another problem is that the inclusion of immigration has disguised the disappearance of important issues such as enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In January Mr Aznar applied the motto 'More Europe' to enlargement. It is now impossible to hide a certain amount of disappointment that has been felt, at least to date. The miserly proposal by the Commission has been rejected by most countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the block by four States in the General Affairs Council last Monday highlights the extent of the problem. A large number of Member States want a bigger market but not more Europe. The reasons for this are budgetary and the objective is to dismantle the limited common policies. Yes, Mr de Miguel, 'More Europe', a bigger Europe, but not a hollow, empty Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, in January, Mr Aznar literally demonstrated his intention to create an area of greater economic prosperity to safeguard the European social model, but the Barcelona Council and the policies his government intends to apply in Spain show evidence to the contrary. Sadly, the fears we had prior to the Barcelona Council can now be confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has led a vision of Europe that avoids including the idea of public service in European integration, which, in its own interests, confuses privatisation and deregulation processes with liberalisation measures, that advocates labour policies which, in practice, establish regressive distribution of the social product, threaten stability in employment and contribute to pockets of exclusion and underemployment and sanction the zero deficit at the cost of perpetuating social deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Between Barcelona and Seville, the Spanish Government has been informed that a general strike has been called. There is no alternative, as its labour reform, which eliminates protection against unemployment and reduces redundancy pay, is another sign of what the Spanish Presidency means by making the labour market more flexible. This is a model which, far from promoting social participation and cooperation for the greater good, places further pressure on the least protected sectors, blames the victims of the model itself and increases the possibilities of social exclusion and marginalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of economic uncertainty in the labour market, the economic policies of the Member States need to be discussed and coordinated in order to boost the economy, make the margins for budgetary action more flexible and to promote cohesion and the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union may be an essential marker for world economic growth, but in order to achieve this, and for an upturn to become reality, the economic policy must change course. The euro, the internal market, common policies and an increased Community budget must contribute to establishing an effective European economic government that is capable of encouraging economic growth and sustainable development, improving income distribution and achieving full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go around singing the praises of 'More Europe' whilst we are seeing a deterioration in social policies or fewer European policies. Mr de Miguel, we do need more Europe, but, most of all, we also need a better Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Spanish Presidency for its very professional and successful approach to its many responsibilities and obligations. I note with satisfaction that we did not have any embarrassing incidents during the Presidency, as we have had in other recent presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Spanish Presidency, negotiations for future European enlargement are continuing at a strong pace. The European Union is currently dealing with difficult areas such as agricultural affairs, regional policy and budgetary matters. We all know the moral arguments for enlargement of the Union. Developing democratic and civil societies, respecting the rule of law and promoting human rights are central goals of the Union. The European Union is a political model that has helped to bring peace to our continent. This process will be furthered, not diminished, by the enlargement of the Union. But we must all reflect on the key practical procedure being used to streamline the enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2000 European Union leaders agreed a set of Treaty reforms in Nice which they considered would be the best procedure for bringing about enlargement. Already 13 out of the 15 countries in the European Union have ratified the provisions of the Treaty of Nice. If the Treaty of Nice is not ratified by all 15 Member States, enlargement will undoubtedly be delayed. If the Treaty of Nice is rejected by one Member State it is not valid law, because the proposed Treaty changes do not command the unanimous support of all the Member States. Delaying enlargement would have a very negative effect on the development of the Union. Prior to the birth of the EEC in 1957, Europe was bedevilled by hatred and division. The European Union has now ensured that the tools of war have been put aside in favour of the development of new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not simply about mutual economic progress. Thanks to the European Union, Europe's past has been put aside in the interests of peace and prosperity for all the peoples of Europe. That is not to say that the Irish people do not have clear concerns which they want addressed before any further referendum on the Treaty of Nice. The majority want assurances that Ireland's traditional military neutrality will be fully protected and respected by all Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that a declaration is agreed by all European Union leaders, spelling out in unequivocal terms that Ireland's military neutrality will be respected now and in the future. Irish troops have always served in peace-keeping and humanitarian operations under the auspices of the United Nations. The provisions of the Treaty of Nice do not change that. The situation is not altered by Ireland's participation in the European Rapid Reaction Force, but it is still very important and politically necessary for a declaration to be made in Seville expressing the support of EU governments for this special foreign policy issue, which means so much to so many people in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union is the natural home of the Irish, both geographically and politically. We recognise that standing alone is of little benefit when international cooperation is increasing. The European Union must ensure that the interests of each individual citizen are protected at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All countries must be equal in the EU – before, during and after the Seville Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed reform concerning transparency does not seriously open the Council of Ministers’ work up to the public, let alone to the elected representatives in the European Parliament and the national parliaments. What is wanted is an open debate on Commission proposals when these are first tabled, and it is true that transparency will embrace all proposals. It is not, however, until the end of the process that voting will be opened up and, because only a small number of proposals are voted on in practice, this part of the exercise is purely cosmetic. We shall learn no more than we do at present when the Council publishes approximately 50 records of the votes per year. The problem is that 70% of decisions are finalised by the Council’s working parties and 15% at meetings of COREPER ambassadors. Only 15% of the proposals are put before the Council, and we do not have figures for what percentage ministers in actual fact see. The requirement in this area must be that all elected representatives, at least, have full right of access to documents as part of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised us that we can be shown Members’ contributions to the Council’s working parties. I am pleased that, yesterday at the Conference of Presidents, the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Piquet, promised us full access to the Council’s working parties during the codecision process, and so that is a good beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Why not decide that every EU proposal is to be put before the national parliaments and go through the same process as national bills. A purely national bill can always be altered, whereas an EU bill can never be altered. That is precisely why an EU bill should not be debated any less thoroughly than those bills which permit the rapid adjustment of errors or unintended consequences. It could be assumed that the right of veto under the Luxembourg Accords should continue to apply, perhaps in the variant proposed by Georges Berthoin, Monnet's right-hand man, whereby the prime minister is obliged to defend a veto at the next summit. It might also be required that a national parliament’s decision to use the veto be made openly. It must not be made easy to block a proposal, but use of the veto must be an option if the EU is to consist of cooperation between parliamentary democracies in free countries. That is our wish in a Europe of democracies and diversities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cappato (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I would like to focus on the first theme introduced by President Prodi of better regulation and better organisation. While, in private enterprises, better organisation might be seen as a decisive factor for the life or future of the company, I feel that the priority for a democratic institution should not be to have leaner, more transparent, more effective procedures but simply to have more democratic procedures. I am not saying we do not need lean, transparent, effective procedures too but that there is a problem of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that expressions such as ‘improve and simplify legislation’, ‘give practical substance to the concept of citizenship’, ‘improving legislative technique’ and ‘working faster and better’ are liable to be meaningless and even to serve as fig leaves covering up the lack of democracy in the European Union’s legislative and decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that Parliament must demand one thing and one thing alone: that the Council of Ministers cease to be the only legislative body of so-called democratic institutions in the world to meet in secret. This is the crucial thing! Not just Parliament but the European citizen too is in the dark about the Council’s legislative process. If this is conceded, it will be a step forwards; if it is not, none of the rest – not even more effectiveness or better organisation – will make any difference to the European Union’s decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue I would like to focus on is the foreign and internal policy aspects of the anti-terrorism alliance.<span class="bold"> </span>Here, too, I believe that the European institutions have been disregarding the guiding principles of democracy and the rule of law for too long in the name of combating terrorism. We all agree on the need for a balance between these two requirements, but I feel that a sufficient balance has not yet been found. I will mention one place, Chechnya, by way of example. As regards Chechnya, the European Union and the Member States have shown themselves to be incapable of consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">I could mention other things such as measures for combating terrorism, measures which have been introduced: what has been done has been done in a disturbingly unbalanced way, in the name of security but very often with disregard for human rights, civil liberties and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The final issue is that of immigration. I appreciate the efforts which are being made, but I feel that there is a problem of priorities in respect of this issue too. We cannot expect to continue to block imports of goods, farm produce and basic manufactured goods from the poorer developing countries throughout the world and, at the same time, cherish the fond hope that we are managing the issue of legal and illegal immigration properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still in a situation where the customs tariffs imposed on imports from the poorer countries in the world are greater than the aid we give those countries. In this situation, immigration is in danger of exploding uncontrollably, and so even security and control measures which may, in themselves, be appropriate are actually in danger of sparking off even greater illegal activity and of placing us in a position where we are even less able to control the phenomenon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, some of these criticisms reminded me of what Oscar Wilde used to say about bad literary critics: they never enjoy any success, despite having been to all the opening nights. Secondly, it is important to bear in mind that summits give rise to a number of expectations that are not always fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it should be pointed out that what is most important about a summit – and this is what we are hoping for from Seville – is that it can generate enough political momentum for the project of European union to progress. In this respect, the lines of thought announced by President Prodi on behalf of the European Commission seem to me to be particularly suitable. Leaving aside the subject of the Barcelona mandate and the issue of accession – which will be the subject of a later debate this afternoon, and which will clearly show where the real difficulties of accession lie, as they are neither in the Presidency-in-Office nor in the Commission – I would like to express my satisfaction at the reference made by the President-in-Office of the Council to the fact that Seville will not interfere with the work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it would be desirable to discuss some of the matters relating to the reform of the Council in detail. Perhaps the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council could talk to us about these different functions or mandates of the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Affairs Council and how they plan to proceed more effectively, without dedicating themselves to negotiating every last detail of previous debates, and giving political momentum to the subject on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by referring briefly to immigration, which is a very serious, urgent topic that is particularly relevant at a time when various Member States are adopting individual policies, some of which are contradictory. I therefore believe that we must clearly support the objectives expressed here by the Commission and by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, emphasising two aspects: first, that this issue should not be used for the purposes of engaging in manipulative rhetoric, and secondly that we must find real solutions to real problems and try to strip this debate of ideological waffle. It is important that we strike a balance between the European Union’s tradition of welcome and hospitality – bearing in mind our values, as expressed in the fitting phrase “immigrants might not have papers, but they shall have dignity” – and its actual possibilities, which are not unlimited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe must continue, for ethical reasons, to stand by the principles of a humanitarian asylum policy. We must continue to make our citizens understand that we need immigrants. But we still have to prove to them that we can manage and control immigration and this – as the Spanish Presidency quite rightly maintains – means involving our neighbours, especially the countries from which illegal immigrants come and the countries they pass through.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, however, we must all join forces in fighting the people who rake in huge profits from trafficking in human beings. Mrs Rosa Díez González spoke of the Spanish Presidency's drum roll. This comment probably applies to us all, given the drum rolls we play all over the place. But if we take a close look at what the European Union as a whole has done to combat trafficking in human beings, then I for one see very little. Some Members of the House recently visited Bucharest with their national counterparts and went to an anti-cross-border crime centre. This centre is supported by a few Member States, it is supported by the Americans, but it does not receive any European funding. Worse still, we are only now just slowly beginning to make contact with Europol or rather Europol is only now just slowly beginning to take any real action here. I think what the citizens of Europe expect is a positive immigration policy that also cracks down on the increase in human trafficking and other criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, however, have to give the people who come to our countries the opportunity to integrate into our society. By carving out a living for themselves – and many are involved in setting up new companies – they increase prosperity for all of us. This is not just a game of heads or tails, with either the immigrants winning or the locals winning, we all stand to gain from a reasonable, targeted immigration and integration policy if we would only just get on with it and put everything Commissioner Vitorino and the Council have proposed into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, however, we also expect Seville to send out some sort of message about the reform of the Council. As Mr Poettering said, things have gone a bit quiet on this front and there are rumours that no one really wants to do anything about it. However, as the members of the Council themselves know, the Council is in urgent need of reform, especially in its legislative capacity, mainly to make it more efficient and transparent. You only have to compare the openness and accessibility of this House with the situation in the Council. A few concessions at least to transparency and openness would not go amiss and would both serve the Council's interests and enhance acceptance of the European legislative process as a whole in the eyes of the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should just like to point out that this House and my group are prepared to push ahead with further reform of the European legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, as the President of the Commission mentioned, the Commission has tabled a number of proposals in this direction. I should like to thank you and your colleagues, Mr President of the Commission, for adopting many – not all but a great many – of the thoughts and ideas which have emanated from this Chamber. But now, as my colleague has already said – we need to set up an interinstitutional working party and come to an agreement here. And in order to do so, we need the Council on board. Mr President-in-Office, I fail to understand, many of us in this House fail to understand how it is that Prime Minister Aznar made a clear promise, that you made a clear promise in this House and the diplomatic and official representatives of the Spanish Presidency have done nothing about it; they have in fact blocked this working party right down the line. I have to say that, as a Member of Parliament, I wonder what counts. Are the promise and the statement made by the President-in-Office and by you what counts or is official blocking during the course of implementation what counts? Surely the political decision-makers should have the last, clear word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Tampere agenda had three elements: control, harmonisation and integration. The Council has eagerly legislated on the first with half a dozen laws and a thirty-page action plan on illegal immigration, but it has lagged on harmonisation for a common asylum system and integration of minorities and migrants. That is where leaders need to give ministers a big kick but instead all they will really do is ratchet up the rhetoric of repression and hostility of fortress Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The most despicable and stupid proposal is the denial of development aid to countries which fail to stem migration, thereby making them even poorer and generating a new exodus of desperate people. The reality is that far from promoting the greater security Europe needs, the illiberal Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio risks creating greater threats for European citizens by their hysterical, populist and macho responses to current challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">By their abusive hysteria about illegal immigrants and asylum seekers they demonise foreigners and generate more race tensions and suspicions. By their big brother extension of powers for police and security services to monitor people's email, Internet and telephone records they menace individual privacy. By banning organisations like the Kurdish PKK and Batasuna they remove political outlets for dissent as an alternative to terrorism. Accession countries are encouraged to seek EU membership as a beacon of democracy, liberty and tolerance but the Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio are making a mockery of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, Prime Minister Aznar currently wants to become the chief of police and would also like to achieve a Europe of States which stands in opposition to the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the proposals he has made for the reform of the Council, I am not sure what I should highlight most: his arrogance or his impertinence. Under the Spanish Presidency, all our problems are worse than six months ago. And Mr Aznar sees himself as permanent President of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish referendum is neither planned nor completed; nor is enlargement, which is, furthermore, in an even more confused state; nor is the common agricultural policy, nor the common fisheries policy, where he failed to understand the real tension that exists between the northern and southern countries; immigration and asylum are confused with criminality and nothing has been done on the structural funds, on the European budget, on full employment, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, there is nothing left of Tampere, Lisbon or Gothenburg. We should ask ourselves what is left of the spirit of these summits. In fact, what is left is a caricature in which José María Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, plays the leading role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This remarkable analysis was made recently by a Dutch columnist. According to him, people have been dissatisfied with the European Union for years. The successes of populist parties across Europe demonstrate that the spark can all of a sudden ignite. I share this concern, although I hope it is unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">Effectively functioning European institutions are therefore of the utmost importance. Organisational problems should not be the cause of stagnating decision-making or consultation. This applies not in the least to the Council. As an encounter of national ministers and prime ministers, this institution is, after all, closest to the people. At the same time, this institution seems to be suffering most from organisational defects following enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done about this? A number of practical proposals have been made here and elsewhere, including, for example, splitting up the General Affairs Council into a Coordinating Council and a CFSP Council. Similarly, the restriction of the permitted number of participants in a national Council delegation is a reasonable option.</p>
<p class="contents">However, more far-reaching proposals, such as abandoning the rolling presidency system, are also doing the rounds. These proposals are only acceptable if the balance between the countries is not lost and also if the national administrations remain closely enough involved with Europe. Indeed, States that are equivalent and involved form the keystone of the European Union. Whoever denies this might well be the one to light the fuse to the powder keg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be wrong and disparaging to say that nothing has been done. Bringing modern IT skills within the scope of lifelong learning, which is Commissioner Liikanen’s department, has, for example, already made progress in many countries. However, in these two years, one of which has been overshadowed by the recession in the United States of America, we have only lagged behind the United States. GNP there has grown faster and unemployment is less than 6%, while it is more like in excess of 10% in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Not nearly enough has happened, therefore. Without going over all the sectors one by one, privatisation, the genuine opening up of markets, and the removal of barriers to restructuring in industry and services have still not come about. The job market remains structurally rigid, keeping the unemployed at bay and protecting those with jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this inactivity are to be found in the Union’s nation states which the Commission has not managed to enjoin or tempt to embrace economic reforms. Short-term real, but also often imagined, interests have come before the common interest. There are always elections going on in some country, and reforms become paralysed for the space of a year. The inflexible nature of the labour market, the maintenance of industrial structures in a way that hinders competition, and the non-existent policy the countries of the Union have on immigration and asylum have led to the sort of dissatisfaction that is now breaking out and which has broken out in recent elections in the form of protests by both the young and the old in Europe unable to find work. In connection with this too is the feeling many foreigners legally resident in many countries in the Union have that they are being discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">I no longer intend to blame the socialist governments that have been edged aside. I am also addressing my plea and warning to the centre-right governments that have come to power via the Commission and the Council. Unless you have the courage to make reforms you can forget the grand words of Lisbon and the future picture of a Europe as the world’s most competitive area! Sometimes I really miss Margaret Thatcher, the fruits of whose policies Tony Blair still enjoys.</p>
<p class="contents">Economical, clean energy is one basic requirement for the economic growth of sustainable development. It is a pleasure for me to praise the political decision-makers in my own country, Finland, for their courage in keeping nuclear energy clearly alongside other forms of development in electrical energy. The decision was that of a small country but was just the sort of courageous start that was needed, although the cacophony that opposes this and wants to put the brakes on progress is loud.</p>
<p class="contents">The country to hold the Presidency, Spain, is to be congratulated now on giving the shaping of a common asylum and immigration policy a key position at Seville. It is necessary, because a Europe whose population is ageing should not be turning away immigrants but integrating them in a controlled way as new Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am telling you this because in this Parliament we are familiar with the Tampere agenda; we know what was decided there. I would like to remind you of this because it does not exactly coincide with what you have told us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere agenda comprised four sections with regard to the common management of immigration; one was family reunification. The Council has already eliminated one proposal. Another is on the parliamentary agenda but not on the Council’s.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy for the management of migration flows, a policy for establishing legal immigration channels, clear, transparent, not drowning in a sea of bureaucracy from 15 different legal systems. A Commission proposal is being considered in Parliament, and it is not on the Council agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">An integration policy that translates into a Commission proposal to create a statute for long-term immigrants. This is not on the Council agenda. We are in total chaos. The Social Affairs Council has approved the free movement of immigrant workers, which is prevented by immigration laws in 15 Member States. This is not on the Seville agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the external agenda: in Tampere, we spoke of co-development, the joint management of migration flows, and you told me that in Seville there is a tiny part referring to the threat to third countries. Co-management is not on the Seville agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration, with which my group and I are entirely in agreement, appears in a somewhat esoteric form. You say that the Commission plan for the joint control of external borders is of particular importance. We do not understand that here, and nor does the public. Are you going to debate this? Why would this be the first thing on the Council agenda?</p>
<p class="contents">Not only this, but the national governments, over the past two years and eight months, have implemented differing national policies in this area. You talk of reviewing the Tampere commitments. Save yourself the trouble – it will not take long, since no progress has been made with regard to immigration in two years and eight months.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council, you are responsible by omission for not having governed Community policy, and that, Mr President, is extremely serious. You are replacing consensus on solutions with making joint gestures that are incapable of resolving problems. You are replacing the adoption of legislation and policies to manage migration flows with writing notes and press releases that contribute to creating a problematic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not be surprised that the citizens view the European Union as a problem and not as the solution it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the evidence should lead us to believe that we should establish in Seville a policy that has been asked for since Tampere, that is truly effective at European level, that has a European dimension and that also establishes and intensifies a real political dimension to the European Union. This is a subject which, through the intergovernmental method, has sadly been postponed for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The second observation I would like to make is that account should also be taken of the external dimension that causes immigration, and that the cooperation mechanisms must therefore be strengthened far more than they have been to date.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one topic should be resolved in Seville: the evident distancing of the positions expressed by the Commission over the past few months from the Commission proposals and their reception by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, specifically, Mr de Miguel has commented on the importance attached to the Convention; it would be good to wait for the results of the Convention before making a series of proposals which seem to rather distort the context in which the Intergovernmental Conference would subsequently have to state its position.</p>

My delegation strongly supports the enlargement process although as part of the institutional reform process designed to bring about our declared goal of a wider, looser Europe and an unwinding of the CAP and CFP. We also believe that the central eastern European countries, having thrown off the mantle of Soviet-dominated communism from which we in the West were unable to protect them, and for which we can help to atone by welcoming them back into the family of European nations, do not simply wish to see the construction of another Brussels-led superstate. We also welcome the rapprochement between NATO and Russia which now shares a common agenda with the EU in the fight against global terrorism and the goal of becoming a functioning market economy as a member of WTO and at peace with its EU neighbours. We strongly support a responsible attitude towards our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do have a number of problems with the resolution, ranging from our opposition to the Treaty of Nice as a prerequisite of enlargement to rejection of a common asylum and immigration policy, which we believe is a prerogative of the Member States, although we strongly favour bilateral cooperation designed to safeguard the integrity of our borders. We remain deeply sceptical that joint Euro-border guards would work in practice and oppose the principle of the European security and defence policy both as a duplication and as a means of de-coupling Europe from our US partners in NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe there is a danger that the International Criminal Court will be used to make political mischief by parties hostile to our American allies. However, we welcome calls for restraint and de-escalation between India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir and note encouraging signs that President Musharraf has finally heeded calls to reign in Islamic terrorists which his regime has until very recently supported, terrorists who have recently committed atrocities against Jamu and Kashmiri civilians and even the Indian parliament. He should arrest and hand over those committing such acts to India for trial and justice.

Mr President-in-Office, you rightly noted in your speech that this conflict threatens to destabilise and endanger the whole region. Concern about this immense danger has brought all of us responsible for foreign policy in nearly all the groups to a common position, as expressed in the resolution on Seville. We call in this resolution for both countries to make every possible effort to deescalate the situation and join in constructive dialogue in a bid to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Both sides clearly have a responsibility to defuse the conflict, which is why I welcome the measures taken over the past few days by India, which has decided to lift the ban on Pakistani aeroplanes using Indian airspace, appoint a high commissioner for Islamabad and order its warships back to port.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect President Musharaf to continue and step up his efforts to stop the infiltration of terrorists via the line of control in Kashmir. If he honours the promises made in his speech on 12 January this year, then a huge step will have been made towards resolving the conflict. I was in Kashmir a few weeks ago and went to an Indian post 3 400 metres up on the line of control, so I know what I am talking about. The war against terrorism can in fact only be effectively waged on the Pakistani side. Pakistan is responsible not just for catching terrorists before they reach the border, but also for meting out appropriate punishment and taking them out of circulation.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point which plays a very important part in the whole dispute is the need to strengthen democracy. India is a democracy and we hope that Pakistan will be too if free elections are held in the autumn and put a democratic government in power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret to say that our great economic influence fails still today to be matched by equally effective political action on the world stage. The Middle East conflict is only the last in a series of cases in which the Union has failed to play a leading role in endeavours to bring peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true, however, that we are still far off the objective of a politically strong Europe, it must be said that the Spanish Presidency has helped us to make some progress. Prime Minister Aznar’s words to the effect that we must all join forces to tackle the extremely thorny issue of illegal immigration are confirmation of the will for Europe to have a single foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The immigration crisis must be tackled responsibly and resolutely, without populism and, above all, without concealing the importance of the issue, as we are all too often wont to do. We need increasing cooperation to control the Union’s borders and the development of a single border policy – it is the Italian Government’s proposal which has been accepted and, I believe, selected by Commissioner Vitorino too – but we also need the costs of containing migration flows in Europe to be shared. That is not all, however. President Prodi is right to say that the causes of uncontrolled immigration must be eradicated. We need to work towards cooperation which genuinely helps the people, not the local dictators, as has all too often been the case. We need to take action to alleviate the debt, as has recently been pointed out at the FAO Summit in Rome too. However, we must not overlook the need for legislation which combines rigour and solidarity, and the only way to achieve this is to regulate migration flows, welcoming those who wish to work in Europe with great respect and rejecting those attempting to organise unlawful activities which are all too often criminal and are sometimes linked to terrorism. The European citizens are demanding this. I am sure that Seville will deliver the response they are waiting for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial that Europe takes responsibility and initiative in solving the crisis in the region and does not just leave the peace efforts to the USA and Russia, especially since some of the EU Member States have strong historical links with the region. I also believe that it is essential for the development of the CFSP that the EU plays a major role.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly agree with the Council's statement about the threat to the whole region and, indeed, the whole world from a nuclear conflict. President Prodi is correct in saying that we have far more opportunity to influence the situation positively before a conflict breaks out than after. I wholeheartedly endorse moves by both India and Pakistan in the last few days, to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kashmir. We have to support these.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the reduced tension at present, skirmishes along the border continue. Casualties continue to rise. So the sooner de-escalation takes place the better. It is vital that diplomatic relations and transport links between the two countries are restored. Bilateral talks between two sides need to take place as soon as possible. Although war seems to be averted for now, tensions could easily rise again, especially around the time of elections in the Indian Kashmir in September.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, it is vital that these elections are demonstrably free and fair. However, we need to ensure that fighting over the territory of Kashmir is stopped permanently. A quest for territory was the catalyst for the Second World War and the solution sought to that issue needs to be applied in this case as well. Just as trade was used to prevent conflict when the European Coal and Steel community was founded, it is vital to consider such means as a peaceful way to keep tensions permanently low. The GDP of the two countries is very low and poverty remains a major problem. Despite recent positive efforts, only half the population of the region is literate, which is a major a barrier to economic growth. It is essential for the EU to prioritise global security through a poverty reduction programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The overwhelming message is clear. War can never be the solution in situations like this. Any action must be economic or humanitarian with positive steps to resolve the high level tensions. Let us now turn our attention to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make a few observations about the Council reforms and the problem of illegal immigrants. As far as Council reforms are concerned, three issues appear to me to be of major importance. These are the improvement and revaluation of the General Affairs Council, the improvement of the decision-making procedure and especially the public nature of Council legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the General Affairs Council should be split up as a matter of urgency, particularly because the specialist councils have pulled far too much power towards themselves, and the General Affairs Council seems to have lost its coordinating task. It might also be helpful if in all Member States, people in charge of European affairs would actually be given the title of minister so that they are put on an equal footing as most specialist ministers. This would facilitate the coordinating role of the relevant ministers both nationally and in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the decision-making procedure is concerned, I should like to advise the Council to study the 34 types of decision in order to find out whether improvements can be made in the Council on this score without amending the Treaty. Decision-making as it stands is totally lacking transparency and the scope of the decisions is unclear. Measures to simplify these and to promote transparency would be very desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as this transparency is concerned, I believe it could be a very important improvement, without changing the Treaty, if public access were organised in the case of decision-making on European legislation. It is one of the fundamental rules of democracy that a legislator lays down legislation in public. The Council of Ministers is one of the few bodies in the world that does not do that, and that is really no longer acceptable. A decision, therefore, to make those components of the Council public that are involved with legislation is required as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a comment on illegality. I welcome the fact that border police will be introduced, but perhaps making airports into external borders again could also be considered. Since at present, security checks are being made at airports anyway, it would be easy also to show your passport. This may be a little like swearing in church, but in my view, the issue of illegal immigrants in Europe must be solved, and the stepping up of security at airports could be an attempt at a solution. In fact, I have always been opposed to the opening up of airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to visit the region a few weeks ago and, from the meetings I held with the parties involved, in my capacity as President of Parliament’s Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I can confirm that, beyond the palpable tensions, there is also a genuine desire for peace. It is true that these two great countries have already gone to war with each other three times: twice over Kashmir and once over Bangladesh. Now, however, what we would have is not just another war, if I may put it that way, because both countries now have nuclear weapons and the ability to move them around. As Mr Ramón de Miguel stressed, the possibility of escalation can never be excluded in a military conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, therefore, been greatly encouraged by some positive developments that have taken place in recent days. On the one hand, we have the commitment given by the President of Pakistan to stop the infiltration across the line of control in Kashmir; on the other, there is India’s decision to reopen its airspace to Pakistani civil aviation, to re-establish diplomatic representation and to withdraw its battleships from the Gulf of Oman. This Monday’s news from the United States, however, linking the terrorist who was planning to manufacture a nuclear bomb with connections in Pakistan, means that we must remain extremely vigilant towards developments in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">The world can only gain from having a European Union that is more active on the international stage. In order for this to happen, however, we must, specifically, improve the coordination of our efforts in external policy and defence, and make real progress towards having a common diplomatic service. This is the only way in which the European Union will be genuinely able to bring its influence to bear in conflict prevention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also showed during the recent elections that those who deny this need and are not prepared to take suitable measures will find themselves ousted from office.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to President Prodi for speaking in such unequivocal terms here today and I welcome and expressly support the Spanish initiative to be taken at the summit in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">President Aznar said that immigration is a key problem and he is right. But what we want are differentiated immigration measures. We want measures to speed up the asylum process and measures to integrate genuine refugees, but we also want measures to control and limit immigration, depending on the capacity and needs of our individual Member States. And we want a package of measures so that war refugees can be housed temporarily.</p>
<p class="contents">What we particularly welcome is the package of measures designed to combat illegal immigration and trafficking, especially the initiatives you intend to take to set up a European border police force to be deployed in the zones along our current and future external borders which are particularly at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome cooperation with the countries from which immigrants come, help in bringing about political and economic stability, readmission agreements and sanctions against countries which are not prepared to protect their borders and even encourage illegal emigration.</p>
<p class="contents">If a great deal has been promised and initiated in the past and very little achieved, it has nothing to do with the Council presidency and everything to do with individual Member States and national animosities.</p>

It is an important confirmation by Parliament that Nice is necessary to facilitate a successful enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to speak directly to the Spanish President-in-Office at this point. The Seville European Council is important for the many reasons outlined in our resolutions here today. However, without the stepping stone of Nice, much of that will be in vain. You must therefore ensure that the Seville conclusions at least include a declaration that Nice does not in any way modify the Irish policy of military neutrality, currently defined as non-membership of mutual defence pacts. I would also urge that this declaration be accepted as a protocol to the next Treaty changes in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Nice does not impact on Irish neutrality. However, considerable anxiety has been created in Ireland by irresponsible scaremongering on this issue by people fundamentally opposed to European integration, people like my colleague in this Parliament, Mrs McKenna of the Green Group, and the ethnic nationalists of the Sinn Fein Party in Ireland. The provisions of Nice are part and parcel of the ground rules on which the candidate countries are negotiating their membership of the Union. Ireland's failure so far to ratify these ground rules serves only to strengthen the anti-European Union sentiment in the candidate countries, to the detriment of all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned at the grandstanding by some Member States, which are resisting the budgetary commitments needed for the successful development of the accession countries' economies. The public at large does not understand the tactical manoeuvring behind these battles. What they see is a penny-pinching attitude, driven by an accountancy approach to politics, rather than the statecraft our citizens are crying out for. If Seville shows some generosity from our political leaders, our citizens will emulate that generosity in return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a step, regrettable as it is, would have been unnecessary if the political establishment in Ireland had made any effort to persuade voters to ratify it. Instead, a diverse coalition was able to exploit unfounded fears, resulting in its rejection and untold harm being inflicted on Ireland's position within the EU and damaging our relations with applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">Successful ratification is possible, but only if a huge effort is put into the 'yes' campaign. Our task is not made any easier because we are asking the electorate to overturn a decision it has already made. Additionally, opponents of the Treaty have been strengthened by their electoral success in the recent Irish general election.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility for securing a successful outcome to the second referendum rests with Ireland's pro-European parties and social partners. However, the prime responsibility rests with the Irish Government. Its task is made infinitely more difficult when its main spokesman at the Convention on Europe, former Commissioner Ray MacSharry, has disappointingly made it absolutely clear that his government has drawn a line in the sand in relation to future European integration. Its approach – to state 'this far and no further' – moves it closer to the British position on Europe, which places more emphasis on a free trade area rather than pursuing political union.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to warn the Irish Government that it is following a very dangerous path. Opportunistic Eurosceptic stances by some of its leading members played into the hands of those who opposed the Treaty of Nice, thereby contributing to its rejection. It does not help that a leading Eurosceptic has been promoted to full cabinet rank. Pandering to the same prejudices again could well result in a second failure and consequently leave Ireland in a semi-detached relationship with our EU partners, and that would be disastrous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remind certain people that we cannot go against our own acts and that what was good three months ago cannot be bad now.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is the issue of immigration. I believe that this Presidency has given a fine example of something very important in politics, which is what in sporting terms is known as suppleness. Immigration was not one of the Spanish Presidency’s priorities, but it has noted that it is now one of the citizens’ priorities, and it has incorporated it into its agenda. And furthermore it is true that there are many issues that have been paralysed for some time in the Council. I believe that instead of criticising that incorporation, we should have applauded the attempt to promote all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a final question, however, which was mentioned by President Poettering, which I believe to be extremely important and which has not perhaps been discussed so much, which is the delay in enlargement. For a long time, led by this Parliament, we have been asking for enlargement to take place within specific time limits and now, all of a sudden, certain Member States, certain leaders of Member States, want to carry out certain modifications of the common agricultural policy, for example, which will make enlargement impossible within those limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, within the constructive environment of this House, I would ask our friends on the Left to speak to Mr Schröder, to Mr Persson and to Mr Blair to see if we can prevent the hindering of enlargement, so that it can go ahead when we want.</p>

Many days have passed, there are still many days left and we are going to do many things.</p>
<p class="contents">The impression is always given that the Union rests upon the will of a single country; holding the Presidency of the Union means that one country is responsible for coordinating the activities of the Union, not for carrying out all the Union’s duties, because that is done by the Union itself. There is something else which is not made sufficiently clear: the results of a Presidency – and at the end of the day a presidency is a period of time – are the results of good inter-institutional agreement: the Council can do nothing without the support and initiatives of the Commission, and the Commission and the Council can do nothing without the support of Parliament. I believe that over these six months – and this is what I should stress most – the Presidency has received great support from the European Commission at all times, and it still is receiving it; thanks to the efforts of the European Commission – and its right of initiative, in accordance with which it has presented its proposals – we have been able to resolve and do many things. Also on the issue of co-decision and Parliament’s legislative duties, truly significant successes have been achieved, which we cannot fail to note: the last sitting approved – without the need for conciliation, and for the first time in history, thanks to the efforts of Parliament – the Research and Development Framework Programme, and also, thanks to the joint efforts of Parliament and the Presidency, the statute on the European Parliament’s electoral system, which had been in deadlock for years, is going to be approved today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to make an assessment of the Spanish Presidency, of course: that will be done by the President of the Council at the sitting of 2 July, which is intended for just that purpose. Then Mr Nogueira will have his wish, since he is so keen to see the President of the Spanish Government. On 2 July, at 10 a.m., we would like to see you here, Mr Nogueira, because, once the Presidency has ended – and it ends on Sunday, 30 June – the President will give an account of its results.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now talking about the Seville Council and there are certain issues I would like to comment on. The President of the Group of the European People’s Party – and certain other Members, such as Mr Swoboda – have expressed concern about the issue of interinstitutional cooperation. I would like to say firstly that it would have been impossible for the Council and the Commission to have made any more effort during this six-month period to reach an interinstitutional agreement. Furthermore, that agreement already exists, I do not know why we are bringing the issue up again. We have held a meeting in which the three institutions have agreed to create a high-level interinstitutional group, on three levels: first-level politician (presidents), second-level politician (commissioners, ministers and committee chairmen), and technical (secretaries-general of the three institutions and ambassadors/permanent representatives). This has now been created. Who is calling this into question?</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, it does not fall to me to explain the conclusions of the Council, that is not my responsibility, but I would urge the Members of this Parliament to read them and, when you have read them, we will speak again. On 2 July, you will have the opportunity to ask Mr Aznar whether or not that commitment has really been fulfilled. I do not understand why demands are being made here when things have developed in accordance with the commitments we had accepted. I would remind you that there was a meeting here in February between President Prodi, President Aznar and President Cox at which the decision was taken. I do not know why the issue is being raised again now. The issue of ‘better regulation’ falls entirely within the framework of that interinstitutional cooperation that we intend to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to other criticisms of the Socialist Group which I have heard, I believe that the syndrome of bringing the antagonism of internal politics to the European Parliament is very bad. I am not therefore going to get involved in that slanging match about who is performing well and who is performing badly. I am not going to respond, since I believe that the Spanish Presidency has done what it could and that its results are sufficiently satisfactory and above all I believe that we will be able to see the results of the Spanish Presidency on 2 July.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other issues in the Council, such as enlargement, this afternoon we will have the opportunity to talk at length. I would like to say that yesterday we finished the latest ministerial conferences on accession in Luxembourg, although there will be another, at vice-president level, before the end of the month. The result is that during these six months 87 negotiation chapters have been concluded. Of 31 chapters, the majority of the Member States have concluded an average of between 26 and 29. In other words, an average of around two or three chapters will remain for the Danish Presidency to conclude. The ‘road map’ has been completed, and the only thing that remains to be agreed on – and which I hope can be agreed before the Seville European Council – is the common position on agriculture. We know why the common position has not been concluded: there are a number of countries which wish to ignore the principles of the Community acquis and establish two classes of country – those which receive direct payments and those which do not – seriously discriminating against the candidate countries and taking advantage of the situation, taking enlargement hostage, in order to further their objectives in terms of the reform of a certain common policy. If they do not agree to what they should agree to, those countries will have to take responsibility for having delayed enlargement and will have to answer to this Parliament, to their respective publics and to the candidate countries. Therefore, on the subject of enlargement I just wish to add that the Seville European Council only has to begin to talk, to acknowledge that the technical ‘road map’ has been completed and draw up a great political itinerary: what is going to be done after concluding the negotiations, to see what our perspective is going to be for 2003, how the Treaty is going to be signed, how the ratifications are going to be carried out, how the new candidate countries are going to be incorporated into the Intergovernmental Conference and how they are going to participate in the European Parliament elections. That is the political ‘road map’ that the Seville European Council has to draw up; the technical one is finished. Therefore, you can rest assured, since, with the efforts made by the Council and the tremendous support of the Commission, the Spanish Presidency has been able to fulfil the mandate of the European Council and also of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the Council, it is clear that the Council has a dual dimension: executive and legislative. The legislative dimension needs to be more transparent – we are the first to agree with this – and the reforms of the Council move in that very direction. They also move in the direction of making it more effective; to divide up the General Affairs Council and the External Affairs Council; to reduce the structure of the Council; to establish better methods for preparing European Councils; also reducing the machinery of the European Councils and making them more effective and smaller; to create a system of conclusions which does not involve an interminable debate on insignificant details etc. All of these are possible internal reforms of the Council which move in the direction of transparency, but which in no way compromise the provisions of primary Law, which fall to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to continue to insist on the economic issues. There is an issue which I have not mentioned, since it was the subject of a debate yesterday afternoon in this House: the Johannesburg Summit and sustainable development. We are very aware of the failure of the preparation conference in Bali, the PREPCON, and we want the Seville European Council to offer clear guidelines in order to re-affirm the leadership of the European Union in relation to the big issues for Johannesburg, which are development aid, respect for the environment and sustainable development. During this Spanish Presidency, the Union has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and obtained a commitment in Monterrey on funding for development which in reality is a commitment on which we have managed to combine the wills of everybody and by means of which the whole of the developed world has committed itself to increasing its level of development aid. I believe that these two factors can allow us to go to Johannesburg with the conviction that we belong to a group of countries which lead the world on all the great issues of sustainable development. The Seville European Council will therefore acknowledge this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to say to Mr De Rossa that the European Council will give its opinion on the particular problem that he has mentioned, on a declaration which may help Ireland to present itself better and to provide greater security for its citizens in light of the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. This issue will be dealt with and we hope to be able to issue a declaration which is as positive as possible, along the very lines that Mr De Rossa has indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as all these issues, there are other external policy issues which we have already discussed. I have taken good note of the speeches, in particular those which relate to the conflict between India and Pakistan. I would like to reiterate the European Council’s intention to deal with this issue by sending the most forthright and constructive possible message and I believe it is almost impossible to examine everything that is going to be dealt with at the Council in detail, but I believe this Council will be the culmination of an incredibly intense six-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not referred to immigration and asylum, but what I did want to say – since I cannot end without mentioning this issue which has been raised by many of you – is that I believe that the situation of illegal immigration is of concern to the whole of the European public, not legal immigration, since that has its official channels and there are millions of immigrants who have already settled in Europe, which has always been a land of acceptance and asylum. What is raising great difficulties for European society is this wave of illegal immigrants which, precisely because they are illegal, are marginalised, living in illegal situations and are victims of exploitation and therefore suffer to an extent which is intolerable in our society. We must therefore combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Tampere programme, well there it is, and if any part of it has not been implemented, this is due to the fact that it has not been possible to implement it between 1999 and 2002. Is that the responsibility of the Council? It will be, but it is not the responsibility of the current Presidency of the Council, but rather the accumulated responsibility of many other Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this Presidency wants to put the Tampere programme on the table and say ‘let us do it once and for all’, should be praised rather than criticised. Therefore, I believe that this issue, like all the issues relating to illegal immigration, is of concern to European society today and it is logical that the Heads of State and Government should deal with all aspects of them. By the way, this is an entirely public dimension, because there are Commission proposals and furthermore I would like to point out that tomorrow and the next day the Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet and deal with all of these issues. Councils are public and everybody knows the content of their agendas. I do not therefore believe that there are any hidden agendas in relation to asylum and immigration and all the issues to be dealt with at the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would simply like to say that this Council marks the end of this period, which has been hard and difficult; let us hope that the Seville conclusions are able to reflect all the work we have done and that they fulfil the expectations which European society and this Parliament have of the work of the Council and the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">I would just like to stress a few basic points: firstly, I welcome our great consensus on enlargement and I would point out, in this regard, that this is our greatest and most important task for the future; secondly, I am delighted with this debate, which will take us to Seville – Parliament, Commission and Council – with a common line on the interinstitutional agreement and the work on better organisation and better legislation that we have to undertake together.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common desire to complete an interinstitutional agreement before the year is out will have a marked, decisive impact on the way we work, and I believe it will also help to make the Seville Summit a success. I want to make it quite clear – and reassure all the Members of Parliament – that none of this will affect the Convention’s work in any way. This is something we must do without modifying the Treaties, and we have a responsibility to do it for we will have to work with the Treaties in their present form for a long time anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise once again our joint undertaking with regard to the major objectives, which many speakers have mentioned in relation to Johannesburg. We have not been treating it as a low priority, but I have to say that we are completely on our own in these international conventions. And, quite frankly, I want to say before this House that all these summits we have held, which ought to have shown increasingly great attention towards the Developing World, have not yielded the desired results. Even yesterday, the failure of the largest countries to send representatives to the FAO Summit was a powerful testimony to the fact that this policy needs to be completely revamped.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are contradictions on these issues even in the Union’s own policies. I would remind you of some of the issues which have been mentioned in this House such as Mediterranean policy, the difficulties surrounding the creation of a bank – a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank – to boost development in this area, and the even greater obstacles encountered in our endeavours to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for dialogue between cultures, for which some countries were not even prepared to commit EUR 1 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to immigration, there is remarkable consensus on the key points: border police, cooperation with the future Member States to combat illegal activity, and an active policy aimed, as Mrs Suominen said, at integrating immigrants and making them genuine citizens of the Union. This is the shared objective towards which we are all working.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have to remember that, if we are to achieve this goal, it is our duty, our responsibility to fight for an active role in integrating immigrants and reuniting families, and to establish, as Mr Pirker said, long-awaited immigration guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">This, ladies and gentlemen, is the task we have to tackle together. It will allow us to reach a goal which we all share: the goal of preparing for enlargement of the Union with institutions which are able to cope with this difficult project.</p>
