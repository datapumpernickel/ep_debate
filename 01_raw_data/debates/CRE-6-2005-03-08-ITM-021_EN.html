This crisis, which was triggered by the three-year extension of President Lahoud’s term of office imposed by Syria, culminated in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and ten other innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has firmly condemned this barbaric act and this House debated it at length just a few days ago. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was a man of peace who believed in dialogue, and was a friend of Europe. The challenge that Lebanon is facing needs to be met with unity and calm, and respect for the two principles for which Mr Hariri fought throughout his life: Lebanon’s independence and sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">The resignation of the Karami government in the face of popular pressure has created a new situation of which we need to take advantage. The Presidency wishes to congratulate the Lebanese people on their courage and determination to regain full sovereignty and to live in freedom in a democratic country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council bodies held an initial exchange of views on the Lebanese crisis on 4 March, and revisited this issue this morning in the presence of Mr Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy responsible for the implementation of Resolution 1559.</p>
<p class="contents">For his part, the High Representative, Javier Solana, will tomorrow be meeting a delegation of representatives of the Lebanese opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thrust of the European Union’s action should be as follows. First of all, we need to support the formation of a new transitional government acceptable to the key players in Lebanese politics and respecting Lebanon’s constitutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if political life in Lebanon is to return to normal, the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Rafik Hariri and those responsible for it need to be carefully scrutinised. The Union therefore supports the United Nations commission of inquiry and intends to keep up pressure on the Lebanese authorities to carry out a thorough investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important to support the holding of free and fair elections. The European Union will be willing to provide assistance in this respect, in particular by sending a team of election observers if the new Lebanese Government so wishes. For its part, the Commission is about to carry out an exercise on the ground to assess the need and scope for electoral assistance. The Commission will be able to give fuller details of this in its own presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have to keep up pressure on all concerned to achieve full and immediate implementation of Resolution 1559, which calls for complete and immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council assures the European Parliament that it will spare no effort to achieve a political solution to the Lebanese question, in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the Lebanese people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold"> Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak to you about the situation in Lebanon on behalf of my colleague Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner responsible for External Relations and the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We were shocked and saddened by the appalling terrorist attack perpetrated in Beirut on 14 February, which took the lives of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and of many other victims, while over a hundred people were seriously injured. It was the most devastating attack in Lebanon since the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hariri was one of the main architects of the 1989 Taif Agreement, which marked the end of the civil war in Lebanon. He was responsible for promoting the rebuilding of his country after it had been torn apart by war, and his name became synonymous with peace and reconciliation based on a delicate balance between the 18 religious communities that make up the country. We worked closely with Mr Hariri and his government. Negotiations on an association agreement were concluded during his term of office, and an interim trade agreement came into force in March 2003. Mr Hariri also fully supported the dialogue on the European Neighbourhood Policy, which also covered Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few weeks, following the death of Mr Hariri, thousands of demonstrators have protested against Syria’s military presence in their country, in defiance of a government ban. In the face of the unrelenting pressure following the assassination of Mr Hariri, the Lebanese Prime Minister Omar Karami and his government resigned on 28 February after an extraordinary parliamentary debate on the political situation following Mr Hariri’s death.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming weeks will clearly be decisive for the country and it is vital that the parliamentary elections in Lebanon should be held on schedule in May. The Commission hopes that calm will prevail during this period and that channels of communication between the various political groups will be kept open. The elections must be held in accordance with a free and fair electoral process, without any foreign interference or influence, and under the sovereign control of the Lebanese authorities. These elections could mark a turning point in the return of Lebanon to full independence and sovereignty. Along with its other partners, the European Union must remain vigilant as regards the conditions under which these elections are held and we should make our position known to the Lebanese.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is considering how it can help to ensure that these elections are held in appropriate conditions. We are examining the possibility of sending an election observation team. We also envisage, should it be necessary, other means of providing support to guarantee an open and free electoral process. We have in mind, in particular, the training of local observers. At present, we are making preparations for an exploratory technical mission to Lebanon. We wish to evaluate what we can do to ensure that the elections are held in optimal conditions, and we do not rule out the possibility of sending EU observers if the Lebanese Government invites us to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union attaches the greatest importance to the full implementation by all parties concerned of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, whose objectives we firmly support: free and fair elections without foreign interference, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the control of the government over all Lebanese territory. Some of these demands have been conveyed to Lebanon over the years in key European Union messages. The European Union fully supports the work of the UN Secretary-General. We await with interest his report, due at the beginning of April, on the progress made in achieving the objectives of Resolution 1559.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission is in the process of forging ever closer links with Lebanon under the European Neighbourhood Policy. On 2 March the Commission presented a report on Lebanon giving a wide-ranging overall view of the political, economic and institutional situation, and also of the state of EU-Lebanon relations. This report will provide a basis for work on the action plan for partnership with the neighbouring countries, which will include important priorities such as a closer political dialogue and greater cooperation in a variety of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lebanon and in other partner countries, the progress made under the European Neighbourhood Policy will reflect their own efforts and their own successes, with the active support of the Union, of course. In order to take account of recent political developments in Lebanon, the Commission has recommended that the timetable for the next stage of our work and consultation with the Lebanese authorities on the action plan should be linked to developments in that country’s situation. It goes without saying that we need to know how the situation is evolving before we move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are pursuing our discussions with Parliament and the Council on the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, which, with effect from 2007, will enable us to match our political ambitions with the necessary financial resources. We hope to have a result before the end of this year, which will allow us to start the planning process for 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will continue to support the efforts being made towards reform and democracy in Lebanon by means of the association agreement and under the European Neighbourhood Policy. I hope that this House will be our firmest ally in supporting those efforts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that one of the most obvious conclusions must be the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, which must be immediate and must also include the secret services. There can be no excuse for failing to comply with the terms of United Nations Resolution 1559 and Syria must refrain from interfering in Lebanon’s internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Michel has said, it is clear that free elections must be held in Lebanon without any type of pressure, and we in our political group are pleased with the Commissioner’s comments to the effect that a technical mission is going to be sent to Lebanon with a view to preparing a European Union mission of electoral observers.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it is absolutely essential that there be a committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder of the former Prime Minister in an independent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this morning all the political groups have negotiated a compromise resolution on this extremely important issue of Lebanon and a satisfactory solution must be found for the inclusion of Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations, since we believe that the actions of this organisation have been proven beyond all doubt and, Mr President, the terms of the compromise resolution will have to be adjusted in order to accommodate a decision which is in line with the concerns expressed within our political group.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that the European Union – as the President-in-Office of the Council and the representative of the Commission have said – must advocate the existence of a democratic, independent and sovereign Lebanon, and the instruments available to us by means of the neighbourhood policy and the association agreement offer us a good picture of the form this relationship may take. I would insist: an independent, democratic and sovereign Lebanon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Syrian military occupation can no longer be tolerated and the time has come for the positive but vague declarations made by the President of the Syrian Republic in recent days to give way to firm action with a clear and immediate timetable. We repeat our strong condemnation of the attack which caused the death of ex-President Hariri and the loss of so many lives, and we support the determination of the United Nations Secretary-General to see a full investigation of this episode.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of Lebanon can only be the result of a democratic process, based on respect for human rights, with a first step being a decision to forge ahead with parliamentary elections in May. Those elections must be free, democratic and transparent, which is why we are asking for them to be prepared and monitored by a team of European observers in which, as in the case of Palestine, the role of this Parliament should be a prominent one. All parts of Lebanon’s complex society must feel they are involved in this process and in the protection of their country’s unity and territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Syria, it is a vital country in the Middle East as a whole, a country which can and must opt unreservedly for democracy, for the fight against terrorism and for a constructive role in the solution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. For a long time, Europe has had a policy of friendship towards Damascus, and I hope that the decisions taken today by its leadership will help to consolidate this relationship and render it irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Middle East as a whole have a responsibility to support the efforts of the President of the Palestinian Authority to reach a just peace with Israel and to collaborate in the development of a Palestinian state. For this purpose, there must be an end to all support for terrorism and terrorist organisations, both inside their respective states and in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not forget the Israeli-Syrian dimension of this conflict. Here, we hope for a re-establishment of relations, leading to a peace agreement and to the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Golan Heights. For too long, the violence of terrorism and of armies of occupation has prevailed in the Middle East, and it is time for a return to the rule of law. Only respect for law in international relations and for democracy in internal affairs can guarantee peace, stability and prosperity across the Middle East as a whole. In this context, the European Union must redouble its efforts, enhance the effectiveness of its political role and increase and re-focus the economic resources deployed to achieve these aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the resignation of the Karami government and the joint declarations by Presidents al-Assad and Lahoud on the withdrawal of Syrian troops, there were still tens of thousands of people demonstrating yesterday in Martyrs Square – now rechristened Freedom Square – to express their will and to keep up the full weight of pressure on political figures necessary if a genuine democratic process is to be set in train.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that this people was almost entirely united. I used the word ‘almost’ because one note of discord was struck by the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, in his speech calling on his followers to demonstrate today, at this very moment, against the UN resolution, and to protest shamelessly against foreign interference and, I quote, ‘to continue resistance against Israel’. I found this latter part of his speech particularly disturbing because it expressed a desire, which I hope is a minority view, to oppose the very fragile resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us here will be going to Cairo on Friday to take part in the plenary session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. We are aware of the absolute need on that occasion to bolster the position of the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in his courageous desire to reject violence and, as a first step, to establish, in conjunction with Israel, a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">If it became apparent that Hezbollah were firmly resolved to oppose this process, it would then be for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to take appropriate action and to go so far – and why not – as to include this movement in the list of terrorist organisations. I hope that the Council will not need to go that far, as I would like to continue to believe that the enormous desire for peace will win the day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have also expounded and supported those views yourselves, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Michel.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome and encourage the popular demonstrations now being held in Beirut and those that recently took place in Kiev, and believe there are lessons to be learnt from them. We believe they provide the strongest guarantees for the process of democratisation, as long as the people involved know and feel that they can count on international support. That is a lesson we must remember and from which we must draw conclusions for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, like those demonstrators and like the united people of Lebanon, are waiting for clear answers to emerge from the inquiries being held – both the fact-finding mission dispatched by Kofi Annan and the investigations being undertaken by the Lebanese authorities – to identify precisely who was responsible for this appalling act.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also heard the statements made by the Lebanese and Syrian Presidents, and we look forward to further statements. In fact, given that provision is made for this in the Taif Agreement, why should the security services be excluded from the withdrawal plan? The Syrian security services in Lebanon should also be withdrawn. It has to be said now that pursuing this process of democratisation is the best means we have of ensuring stabilisation, and we have already heard just how crucial that stabilisation is for the region. We expect a great deal from the democratisation process, and the Commission should not, in the report it is preparing on all aspects of the situation in Lebanon and on EU-Lebanon relations, overlook certain key issues that are fundamental for the future of democracy. These include the return of the death penalty; the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared in Lebanon; Lebanon’s adoption of the Rome Statute on which the International Criminal Court is founded; its adoption of the Geneva<span class="bold"> </span>Convention<span class="bold"> </span>Relating to the Status of Refugees; a solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees; and also certain individual cases of great concern to this House, such as that of the lawyer Mr Mughrabi, who is in prison today as a result of statements he actually made in this Chamber to Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore a lot of hopes riding on this situation, hopes that I am sure this resolution will encourage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clarity in expressing the urgent need for an independent international inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the assassination of the former prime minister, its causes and effects; in expressing the solidarity that must be shown towards the democratic, peaceful and pan-community movement demanding full sovereignty for Lebanon and democratic elections; and in expressing the demand that Syrian troops and intelligence officers withdraw, under the Taif agreements and the United Nations Security Council Resolution. Clarity is essential, then, but clarity must be accompanied by responsibility, given the extraordinarily fragile nature of the mosaic of Lebanese society. It is this responsibility that has led my group to request a separate vote on paragraphs 6 and 7 of the compromise resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly there is the Syria question. The withdrawal to the Bekaa Valley, as laid down in the Taif agreements, is, by objective standards, a laudable step and the demand for an end to any foreign interference cannot only be aimed at one country. Israel still occupies Lebanese land and France and the United States are hardly innocent bystanders. This is particularly true of the latter, which gave tacit approval to the Syrian presence in Lebanon for years and years, and yet now, with the strongest military presence in the region, approaches Syria with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop. This is another disaster in waiting for peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of Hezbollah. There is no organisation that I could feel further removed from, but demonising the so-called ‘Party of God’ and classifying it as being wholly dependent on Syria is neither wise nor true. Hezbollah cannot be fought by placing it on terrorism lists, but by committing its political wing to the democratic process, by tackling the brutal inequalities in Lebanon and by achieving a fair resolution of the conflicts arising from Israel’s occupation of land. Let Europe provide an alternative to the policies of blindness and force in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Security Council’s Resolution 1559 is not yet applicable to Damascus. It clearly demands the total and immediate withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanese territory. Ominously, at the end of last week, the Syrian Head of State did not breathe a word about the influential presence, within Lebanese territory, of his secret services, which would appear not to form part of the Syrian troop movements there. This is consistent with the recent Israeli observation that Syria is currently preoccupied with strengthening its secret presence in the land of the cedar, something of which the UN Secretary-General was officially informed yesterday by the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is yet another way in which Damascus is brazenly flouting resolution 1559. The resolution stipulates the disbanding of all militias in Lebanon. This would involve the dismantling of the Shiite terror movement Hezbollah, pawn of both Syria and Iran against the Jewish state, as well as the forced departure of dozens of officers of the Iranian revolutionary guard, who train Hezbollah and Palestinian terror groups within Lebanon’s borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the seriousness of the situation in Lebanon, I hope that the Council and the Commission will deliberately obstruct those forces in Syria, Lebanon and Iran that do not want to know of a fully-fledged Lebanese state sovereignty, or like any political settlement between Israel and its closest Arab neighbours. Damascus, Teheran and their Lebanese satellites should stop their sinister game once and for all. It is up to the Council and the Commission to do something practical to bring this about. They would, for example, do well to start by placing Hezbollah on the European list of terror organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Elections have been held in Iraq, but there is ongoing disorder and widespread killings are taking place. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have met and this can be seen as a first step on the long road to peace and reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Now the focus is on Lebanon and Syria. The catalyst for this political uncertainty was undoubtedly the killing of the Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The Lebanese Government has since resigned.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know of the tragic civil war that engulfed Lebanon between 1975 and 1990. We all know that the Taif Accord, designed to bring about peace in that region, is in place. However, the bottom line is that there are still 15 000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. While I recognise that this is substantially less than the 40 000 that were there until the late 1990s, the Lebanese people clearly want the Syrian troops out of their country. That is why I welcome the recent statement by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He signalled that Syrian troops would withdraw from Lebanon. The sooner that is done the better. President Bashar al-Assad specifically recognised that Syria would not stay in Lebanon once the Lebanese people did not want them there. We all know what the answer to that is, so the Syrian troops must be swiftly withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the previous speaker’s comments about groups already beginning to work inside Lebanon to destabilise the country yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">In the broader political field, the European Union and Syria have yet to agree on a new EU-Syria economic association agreement. I believe that securing agreement for such a new arrangement would help to improve relations between the European Union and the Syrian people. The implementation of such a treaty is long overdue. I urge the Council presidency to work towards finalising this arrangement as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are 14 000 Syrian soldiers stationed there, which is 14 000 too many. Yesterday’s decision by the Lebanese and Syrian presidents to withdraw some of Syria’s troops from Lebanon is a step in the right direction, but only a small one. It is not only regular military units that are stationed in the country, but also the Syrian special services. To put it quite bluntly, the latter exert an influence on the internal situation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that paramilitary, or, more accurately, terrorist organisations are stationed in Lebanon is a further problem the country faces. I am astonished that the Parliament resolution no longer refers to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah organisation as a terrorist organisation, as it did in its original version. I find this entirely incomprehensible. We should call a spade a spade, and call terrorists terrorists.</p>

<p class="contents">I also wish, in accordance with the declaration of the United Nations Security Council of 15 February, for the truth about the causes and circumstances of this attack to be established, so that its perpetrators can be swiftly brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This was an attack on all the peoples of Lebanon, regardless of their faith or political hue, and was carried out to create a climate of fear in the population. We should not play into the hands of those who seek to destabilise Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">This event is a reminder of just how important it is to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which reaffirms the international community’s commitment to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, which implies total and immediate withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must remain active and vigilant, so as to ensure that the forthcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for the spring are held in democratic and transparent conditions. These elections will give an indication of the commitment – or lack of it – of the parties concerned to respond to the demands of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should perhaps take the initiative of organising a peace conference on Lebanon, with a view to taking advantage of the climate currently prevailing in the Middle East, which favours the settlement of long-standing conflicts.

We certainly hope so, but Lebanon has little in common with Ukraine or Georgia. It will be neither easy nor perhaps totally desirable to break the links with Syria enshrined in the Taif Agreement, but those links need to be clarified and stabilised, and both popular and international pressure will be needed to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear right now is that the murderers of Rafik Hariri and of the 14 Lebanese citizens who died in the attack are still at large. Syria must be able to withdraw from Lebanon without losing face, but the redeployment of its troops cannot be limited to the Bekaa plain if the timetable for permanent withdrawal has still not been established. The organisation of the forthcoming parliamentary elections has now become a test of Lebanon’s desire for change. Hezbollah is also a major pawn in Syria’s policy and is undermining the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, as Mr Morillon pointed out. However, that will also be the case until Israel withdraws its troops from the Golan Heights, as demanded by the United Nations in its various resolutions. Ultimately, the opposition, by uniting and expressing a desire to proceed step by step, has demonstrated an astonishing maturity and has shown that it is effectively in control of the pre-revolutionary situation that has arisen. While we can support this movement, we cannot rush it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament therefore needs to pay particular attention to keeping up pressure on Syria to respect its international commitments. Each of the parties involved – Lebanon, the European Union and Syria – is aware just how close this game is. The shadow of war is still hanging over Beirut, but, at the same time, Lebanon’s opposition has never seemed so united. We do not know this opposition well enough, Mr President, and I would suggest that we take advantage of the next few weeks to strengthen our links with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not like to conclude without offering my condolences and expressing my feelings of sympathy and friendship to Mrs Hariri, who I am sure will also be a protagonist in Lebanon’s future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This population is openly using the same means which the Ukrainian people in Kiev had at their disposal to make their displeasure known. The cedar revolution was also orange.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, there is good news from that region, because it is good news that Syria is finally withdrawing its troops from Lebanon. It would be even better if this could be done more quickly and if Hezbollah were to give up its armed protest against the State of Israel and were to invest its energy in strengthening the Lebanese democracy by peaceful means. What Europe can do, apart from expressing its appreciation for the courage displayed by the Lebanese people, is to refrain from concluding an association agreement with Syria until such time as withdrawal is complete and its support for Hezbollah has come to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth is that Lebanon, following the war and the occupation of Iraq by the Americans, is becoming the field of application of the Greater Middle East plan announced by the United States and adopted by ΝΑΤΟ and the European Union. This plan reinforces the role of Israel, sets its sights on the fight of the Palestinians for a free, independent state and exerts pressure on Syria and Iran. You do not want them to be independent. You only want them to be independent under your control and it is in this direction that resolution 1559 has been raised again. Why has it been raised now, I wonder, and what are you hoping for? Do you not know that it was the outcome of an agreement in order to stop the civil war in Lebanon? And now efforts are being made to create the preconditions so that there can be a new military intervention in the area and overall attack on the peoples. The assassination of the former prime minister of Lebanon is operating as huge provocation with multiple objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the peoples and the political forces in the area must resolve their problems and do not need protectors. Finally, we ask you: how much hypocrisy is there? What about the 40 000 occupying troops in Cyprus? Why do you not ask about them – now, immediately, tomorrow – and why do you not lobby for them to withdraw from the island? Why two sets of standards? That is why we say that the European Union and the United States of America have a different objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">United Nations resolution 1559, put forward by France and the USA, demanding the withdrawal of the 14 000 Syrian soldiers from Lebanese territory and the restitution of sovereignty to Lebanon after over 30 years of occupation, has been fundamentally ignored since the autumn of 2004. It took the barbaric assassination of former Prime Minister Harari to re-invigorate the yearning and desire for freedom on the part of the opposition and much of the Lebanese people, and, above all, to awaken the quiescent conscience of the European Union which had left the Lebanese people for years at the mercy of Syrian domination.</p>
<p class="contents">The new position of the Saudi regime has left Syria isolated within the Arab League. It would therefore be appropriate for the European Union to adopt a dignified position and resolve to make the signing of the association agreement with Syria conditional on its total withdrawal from Lebanon. Let us not desert the Lebanese – patriots who are proud to be Christians and part of western civilisation. Let us not desert them, as Europe has, in the past, deserted so many nations facing up to barbarism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not before time! Syria has occupied Lebanon since 1976 and the Taif Agreement called for its troops to pull out 15 years ago. It is a matter for regret that the proponents of this initiative are not the countries of Europe but the United States. France’s governments both of the left and of the right are particularly guilty here. By supporting the Syrian dictatorship until last year, they have betrayed the friendship that has bound our nation to Lebanon since the time of Louis IX, thus damaging France’s interests in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not delude ourselves: the resignation of Karami’s puppet government and the announcement that Syrian troops are to be redeployed represent just one stage in the process. The complete withdrawal of Syria, that is to say of its army, of its information services and of its 500 000 immigrants, the disarmament of the Hezbollah Islamic militia, the holding of genuinely free elections, the return to their country of outlawed individuals such as General Aoun, the release of all political prisoners and in particular of the Christian leader Samir Geagea – these are the demands of the Lebanese people and the conditions that our own governments should be demanding from Syria’s leaders in order to re-establish Lebanon as a free and sovereign state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too should like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to his family and my hope that the investigation being conducted with international support to find those responsible will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to touch on concerns the imminent elections, following the resignation of the government in Lebanon, and to say that I was delighted to hear Commissioner Michel refer to what the European Commission intends to do so that elections are held properly. I shall insist – as other Members have done – on the issue of the mission of observers from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment concerns certain preconditions to peace and democracy in Lebanon. The first is the safeguarding and protection of the rights of minorities and the procedures to protect their peaceful coexistence. The second is the clear and efficient combating of the activities of Hezbollah, activities which, while centred on Lebanon, also extend outside the borders of Lebanon to the entire Middle East, thereby jeopardising peace. As for the third, the withdrawal of Syrian troops, I say yes, provided that Syria officially announces a timetable, especially following the recent statements by President Assad. I accept the concept of a timetable, and I say that as a Greek who is very sensitive on the question of troop withdrawals, because we too have submitted a similar demand for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Cyprus, and I believe that the international community, which is today insisting to Syria that it withdraw its troops from Lebanon, should also do the same with Turkey and any other countries which have occupying forces in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given the very positive wind blowing in the Middle East, I wish to emphasise the need for the European Union to be present there, not only economically, but also politically.</p>

We are certainly unanimous in calling for a united response based on a combination of principles and action.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bashar al-Assad announced last Saturday that his troops would be withdrawn from Lebanon in two phases. This came in response to demands by France and the United States in particular, but also reflected the pressure of international opinion and that of the Lebanese people. This represents a first step towards the military withdrawal that should have taken place years ago. It also represents a first step by Syria towards the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559. We should take account of this first step, but remain firm and unyielding in our demands for the future. Our road map here is Resolution 1559 as a whole, and we must first and foremost ensure that it is implemented rapidly and in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">That means Syria totally withdrawing from Lebanon, to allow that country to regain its sovereignty and rapidly organise free and democratic elections, in response to the unanimous aspirations of the Lebanese people, whose concerted action and desire for freedom are most impressive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also remain highly vigilant in view of the evolving political situation in Lebanon. Many speakers have mentioned Hezbollah, but what is also needed now is a government. On the other hand, even if a date for the parliamentary elections has not yet been set, it would be advisable for them to be held in the presence of international observers, particularly observers from Europe. What is more, we need to maintain pressure on the Lebanese authorities to continue to cooperate fully with the UN commission of inquiry, so as to investigate thoroughly the circumstances surrounding the attack on 15 February. The reasons for the murder and its perpetrators have yet to be clearly identified. It was an attack on the entire population of Lebanon, regardless of religion or political persuasion. It is out of the question that Lebanon should continue to be associated with the images of division, occupation and violence that we have now witnessed for three decades. The European Union should give its full support to the Lebanese people so that they can regain their liberty. That is the message that this House should forcefully and unanimously convey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Syria may of course be guilty here, but that is only a hypothesis, and I am surprised and disappointed that there is a universal view that only Syria can be considered as the culprit, whereas Syria’s involvement is a complex issue in itself. This applies to both the media and also, unfortunately, to Europe’s political classes, which seem to have taken up the refrain, from the extreme left to the extreme right.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other possibilities. There is Iran – Iran certainly has an interest in diverting attention to Syria – and there is the United States, which certainly has an interest in splitting the Middle East into numerous religious and ethnic communities. There are others.</p>
<p class="contents">Why not look at them too? Who has a vested interest in renewed conflict in Lebanon? Not necessarily Syria, and certainly not Europe, and, with respect to Mr Moscovici and Mrs Le Pen, not France, which, in any event, needs Lebanon, a Christian and multi-faith country which in some ways sets an example for the entire region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A huge number of people are valiantly moving towards better times: Palestinians who tackle people who attack Israeli citizens, Israelis who hand back huge regions to the Palestinians as a first step towards two states, but above all, the Lebanese, who are fighting on the streets for better times without Syrian interference. These courageous people, along with all peace-loving people in the Middle East, deserve our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest threat to the peace process is now Hezbollah, to which organisation we in Europe adopt a naïve and implausible attitude, drawing a distinction between the military Hezbollah and the political Hezbollah. This distinction is not realistic, for they are both run by one and the same leader, namely Mr Nasrallah. He himself admits that there is no distinction, and his second-in-command recently stated on television, and I quote <span class="italic">verbatim</span>: ‘We believe that the political activity is integrated in the military operations, because they are inextricably linked to the political activity’. Then there are those people in the Lebanese Parliament, with whom some in this Chamber would like to do business, and their leader, Hussein Hay Hassan, who himself says: ‘Hezbollah is an organisation in which all fighters are politicians and military at the same time. The way in which some in the West view our organisation is incorrect’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is coming from the people of Hezbollah themselves. It is high time we had the courage to send a clear message to an organisation which has links with Syria and Iran, which attacks innocent citizens and speaks out in no uncertain terms against the peace process and against Syria’s withdrawal from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago, the Council’s representative stated: ‘We are keeping an eye on Hezbollah. If they adopt a bad attitude, we will consider extra measures’. If we now see what is happening, namely protests and threatening language in Beirut which goes against the process, then I think that it is time for action. Many fine words are spoken here about the protesters, but what these courageous people now need is not fine words, but clear action and unambiguous decisions. The time has come to say how matters really stand. Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation and must be placed on the European list of terror organisations. The courageous people in the Middle East deserve us finally having the courage to speak this clear language. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was myself able to meet him on many occasions and came to value the greatness of his vision.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to ensure that there are no more such tragic developments in Lebanon, and one thing, we have to concede, is clear: it was Syria that originally helped to establish peace and to stabilise the country, but, as happens so often in this life, failure to discern the signs of the times can mean that, instead of stability, new conflicts are sparked off and peace is in check. That is why Syria must leave, taking its armed forces and its secret services with it. It should also read the signs from the interior: the old guard in Syria is still in fact standing in the way of development in its own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, here are a few plain truths about Hezbollah. Hezbollah also helped to drive the Israeli forces out, to restore the country’s autonomy and to give it a stable peace. Here, too, though, the same is true: if Hezbollah does not see the way the wind is blowing and is unwilling to help establish peace and stability, then there is no helping it, for nobody in this House will be willing to support it. Let me repeat, then, that if Hezbollah is prepared, as a political force, to establish peace and stability in the region, then it deserves a degree of respect. If it is not, then it will get none whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I want to say in this debate is that Syria, too, is entitled to peace, stability and territorial integrity, but it must be prepared to conclude real peace with Israel, to acknowledge not only its own right to security but also Israel’s, and to help Israel to live in peace and security in the region. If Syria does that, we will be able to support it in that, but this is a clear and unequivocal demand that we must make of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has never been fully recognised as independent by neighbouring Syria, which has not even bothered to open an embassy there, claiming Beirut is too near Damascus. Instead, Syria has promoted through its pan-Arab Ba’athist doctrine a ‘greater Syria’ concept.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure is now mounting on Syria from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the US and Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. However, President al-Assad has only agreed to implement the terms of the Taif Accord of 1989, which obliges Syria to redeploy its 14 000-strong army to the eastern Bekaa Valley, because he is buying time, and he has so far ignored the more comprehensive UN Security Council Resolution 1559. But the heat is now on, following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, with the so-called cedar revolutionaries on the streets of Beirut. These mainly Druze and Maronite Christians are blaming the one-party Syrian dictatorship for their country’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Lebanese demonstrators have their way in the May election, their victory at the polls could signal the end of 30 years of economic and political co-dependence, but it would also make al-Assad’s position a lot shakier. Hizbollah, the international terrorist executive arm of Iran and Syria, which is based in Lebanon but increasingly working to undermine the Palestinian Authority and peace with Israel, is threatened by its Syrian protector’s withdrawal. Hizbollah has 12 MPs in the Lebanese Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers is therefore reluctant to ban it, claiming there is a difference between its civilian political activities and its military wing. Hizbollah itself makes no such distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">France, a traditional friend of the Arab world, is leading this resistance in the Council, with Belgian, Swedish, Irish and Spanish backing. The latter is being particularly hypocritical as the Spanish Government was quite happy to ban Herri Batasuna and eject its MPs from the Spanish Parliament. Why, then, is Hizbollah not banned by the EU until it renounces the use of suicide bombers against innocent civilians and recognises the State of Israel’s right to exist? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I personally once again vigorously condemn the use of violence as a political tool. The murder of Mr Hariri represented an unacceptable escalation of violence. The vital international inquiry must do everything possible to shed light on those responsible for seeking to destabilise Lebanon and creating a climate of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate the Lebanese people on the massive scale and fervour of their popular mobilisation, regardless of religious affiliations, in support of full sovereignty for their country. They are looking to the European Union to support their fight and we must not let them down. In this respect, full and rapid implementation of Resolution 1559 is of course a key priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we need to do everything to re-establish a strong, democratic and sovereign Lebanese state and to disarm all the armed militias. Yes, we need to aim for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, but at the same time we cannot forget the issue of the Golan Heights and the Shebaa farms. The situation in Lebanon must not be decoupled from the general situation in the Middle East. An overall and just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital, and we must give our support to the new Palestinian leader. And yes, the question of the future of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and elsewhere is crucial: the issue of their return must form part of a global settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the successful experience of the election in Palestine illustrates the advisability of having European observers present, and I hope that the Lebanese Government will accept this offer. I accordingly support the Commission’s exploratory initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to stress the need to seek a positive outcome and the prospect of peace in the region as a whole. Syria and Lebanon both have everything they need to develop alongside each other, within the framework of a partnership with the European Union, of our association agreements and our European Neighbourhood Policy. When the time comes it will therefore be up to us to take appropriate initiatives in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First the Georgians, then the Ukrainians, and now, tentatively, the Lebanese, are standing up for the values enshrined in our Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, among our neighbours around the Mediterranean the Palestinian Authority has been the first to organise free elections – more free than any hitherto held in the Arab world. Many Members of this House were able, in early January, to see with what pride the Palestinian people organised these democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, then, we must set our sights higher. If Jordan supports this peace process and Egypt does likewise, then those who want to disrupt it cannot be partners in our Neighbourhood Policy, and we must not mince our words in saying so. What that means in plain language is that Hezbollah’s offices in Damascus and its activities in Lebanon demand that we in the European Union say loud and clear that it is intolerable that President Abbas’ peace process should continue to be undermined. Today, Hezbollah’s activities are not so much directed against Israel; rather, they are targeted responses to individual actions taken by President Abbas in pursuit of peace. Hezbollah knows that if it can still mastermind one or two terrorist acts, as it has succeeded in doing in Tel Aviv, then the process is again in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, it is in the interests of the Palestinian people and of President Abbas that we should make it quite clear that, if Hezbollah does not change tack, then it should be put on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations, just as it already is on that of the United States. I find it regrettable that this has not found its way into our compromise, although there is an amendment intended to insert it. I think that any new European neighbourhood policy must make that clear, for the sake of the Palestinians and the Arabs in the region beset by conflicts, and that it would also be in Europe’s interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The application of resolution 1559 on the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanese territory is the first, but not the only dynamic element in this global approach. At the same time, an international initiative needs to be taken to restart the peace process between Israel and Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a strategic responsibility to take a specific initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, either by preparing a parallel roadmap, or by extending the current roadmap, so that it includes the Israeli-Syrian aspect of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers and the Commission should speed up the procedures to complete the action plan for Lebanon within the framework of the European neighbourhood strategy, just as they should oppose the connection being attempted between the signature of the association agreement with Syria and prior completion of the withdrawal of the Syrian army. It is in our interest to keep our options open with Syria if we want to help democratise the country and bring stability to the area. The withdrawal of the Syrian forces, as agreed, is a first positive step. Our objective is respect for the international legality and the application of resolution 1559. However, this objective should not be selective. It should bind all the countries in the area, including Israel.</p>

For too many years, Lebanon has been governed against a background of ethnic conflicts and foreign interests. The <span class="italic">de facto</span> Syrian occupation of the country has lasted for 30 years and is an obstacle to the development of a proper democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the events of recent days suggest that the Syrian regime is willing to give up its military presence in Lebanon, there are good reasons for maintaining a critical line where Syria is concerned. Anyone with a knowledge of Syria and Lebanon knows that those in power in Syria are deeply involved in Lebanon’s economy, which they attempt to control. Even if the actual military forces are withdrawn from the border areas, the long arm of the Syrian regime will still be able to sabotage democratic development. President Assat has a reputation for ruthlessly using his various intelligence services and his secret police to suppress any resistance to the regime. A fair number of bloody attacks in Syria’s and Lebanon’s recent history are witness to this. In addition, there is the influence exercised over Lebanon by the hierocracy in Teheran, including Hizbollah. I am still waiting to hear a reaction from Teheran, supporting democratic development in Lebanon in unambiguous terms. Syrian withdrawal must be followed up by an assertion that an Iranian military presence in Lebanon is also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States stand together on this matter. The situation must be used to show that transatlantic cooperation can produce results. With reasonable support for the democratic forces and a common front against the enemies of democracy, the EU and the United States will together be able to help democracy on its way – not only in Lebanon, but throughout the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time we have seen Druse, Sunni, Shia and Christians demonstrating together.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what has been termed ‘the spring of Lebanon’ needs political support, pressure and assistance. It is not sufficient to refer back to dignified or dutiful United Nations resolutions, but instead we need a commitment from these institutions, first and foremost to make President Assad of Syria aware that he has to find the courage to go beyond half-measures. Repositioning a few thousand soldiers in the Bekaa valley, 30 kilometres from Beirut, is not a withdrawal and merely looks like a charade.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we know that there will be no peace between Palestine and Israel, or in the Middle East, as long as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon – an offence to the principle of legitimate sovereignty – persists. Since we are convinced that peace, if it is to be genuine, must be based on pluralism, we believe that there must be greater passion and political engagement in support of the peace process and of the restoration of full sovereignty in Lebanon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The message is that the European Union should spare no efforts to allow this country, which has been scarred by decades of violence and which has suffered so much from the conflicts in the region, to regain its full sovereignty, recover its stability and construct a truly democratic society through free elections. It is for that reason that we cannot accept Lebanon being used by those who want to derail the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are undermining the development of democracy in Lebanon, those who are letting themselves be used to prevent Lebanon from regaining its full sovereignty, cannot expect the slightest sympathy for their position from the European Union. I believe that on that point, too, your message is very clear. That naturally also applies to Hezbollah, which has to choose between either taking part in the democratic life of a new, democratic Lebanon, or serving external forces that have no desire for peace either in Lebanon or in the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what Mr Moscovici said: there can be only one road map for the European Union, and that is immediate and full implementation of Resolution 1559. That is why we need to work closely with the United Nations, with the Secretary-General’s envoy, to ensure the resolution is implemented immediately. We must support all those democratic forces in Lebanon who seek change and who desire sovereignty for their country. It is for that reason that free elections in Lebanon are so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
