After all, it is a clear departure from the Russian Federation’s unilateral decision to impose a visa obligation on Georgia. The wording of Paragraph 2 – request for suspension of Moscow’s visa regime vis-à-vis Tbilisi – merits further development in our opinion. Naturally, we expect both parties to display the will to enter into joint consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more serious, in our opinion, is an omission in recital D. It has a direct bearing on the very essence of Georgia’s political stability. Recital D is right to require safety guarantees to be put in place for the group of approximately 35 000 Georgian refugees, some of whom have now returned to the southern region of Gali or commute there on a daily basis for their work. The separatist Abkhazian regime is today in power in that region but – bear in mind – this is in the presence of Russian troops, so-called peacekeepers, who assume a purely passive role.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is missing in recital D, is a reference to the large group of Georgian refugees from Abkhazia who have been on Georgian territory until now. These are an estimated 175,000 to 190,000 refugees and displaced persons, and they are living in truly abject conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely this specific humanitarian problem which poses a direct threat to the authority of President Shevarnadze. These days, the refugees from Abkhazia are putting the thumbscrews on Georgian authorities to secure their return home. In short, they are a continuous source of unrest in Georgia. A situation which Russia is apparently keen to maintain by not forcing Abkhazia to accept a solution for these refugees. Indeed, various schemes have been outlined under international supervision which the Abkhazians have so far put on hold.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these and other highly volatile political situations in the Caucasus, we welcome the suggestion in Paragraph 8 – the appointment of a special European envoy to this strategically and economically important region – with open arms. A watchful European eye may have a preventive effect on this hotbed, and what is more, our presence will hopefully promote internal compliance with formally signed fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Georgia is a long way away, it is true, and a few years ago, the Balkans seemed just as far away. We have now seen the outcome of that situation and just how close they are in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in many respects, Georgia and the Caucasus as a whole already are today what the Balkans were yesterday, the Balkans of the 1990s. Chechnya, Karabakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Georgia as a whole are very frequently experiencing tragic situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia today is a country literally in the stranglehold of its larger neighbour, a country being blackmailed through the oil supply, the gas supply, the electricity supply, blackmailed through visas, with this unbelievable discrimination between the citizens of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and those of Georgia. This situation is the work of Moscow, the new imperialistic policy pursued by President Putin. Georgia is sinking fast, poverty is becoming widespread and the European Union, if you will excuse the language, does not give a damn, either about Georgia, or about this new focus of conflict at the very gateway to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">No solutions are contemplated, although I do not see why it should not be perfectly possible, in a European Union which will have 450 million members, to have 455 million. The only solution which might stabilise the whole region, right on Chechnya’s doorstep, and put a brake on Russia’s hold in this region, the only serious proposal, by which I mean a proposal that Georgia should accede to the European Union in due form, has not been made. We ought at least to recognise that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, visit Chechnya. This invitation is particularly directed at Commissioner Poul Nielson. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These words take on their full meaning when applied to the countries of the southern Caucasus. What region of our own continent, or the next, is more crossed by tensions and issues? What region has a greater need for pacification and normalisation? The southern Caucasus is effectively caught in the pincer grip of regional powers – Russia and Turkey, of conflicts of interest, and hence related military conflicts, from the Nagorno Karabakh plateau to the mountains of Chechnya, or the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The region is stagnating, ossified in political, economic and energy transition processes which continue to exist only in theory. A situation which has until now been held in a vegetative status quo, which may be considered nonetheless as the lesser evil. At least, everything was done to defuse the different justifications for war in the framework of an ad hoc stability agreement. At least the recent incorporation of these three countries, as small geographically as they are strategic regionally, into the Council of Europe could be interpreted as a sign of interest from the nations of Europe, bringing hope of normalisation for the region and a guarantee of a more favourable future for these peoples. </p>
<p class="contents">How, then, is the recent unilateral decision by the Russian Government to impose a visa regime for the citizens of Georgia to be interpreted except as deliberate ostracism severing economic trade and historic links between the formerly fraternal Soviet states. How is this administrative segregation between the citizens of the same country, which is recognised by the international community, the people of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Tbilisi, to be interpreted except as official external ratification overriding the integrity of a sovereign state? </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, is a government bill tabled in the Duma to provide for the possibility of annexing a foreign state, or part thereof, even if there are no borders? These are just so many deliberate, calculated sallies in Russia’s muddled geopolitical game, and just as many reasons for us to use our votes to express our condemnation of Russia’s machinations involving its former vassal state and to take practical action to assist the political stabilisation of this region and its economic take-off, and, of course, to appoint, as the resolution proposes, a Special Envoy for the Caucasus: since a gust of wind in the southern Caucasus may indeed blow Europe away.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unilateral imposition of a visa regime on Georgia, with the exception of two regions of Georgia, will create new divisions in a country which is a member of the Council of Europe, wishes to develop democratically, and with which we have concluded an agreement precisely in order to support it in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments are leading to tensions with neighbouring states and to huge obstacles for the Georgians themselves, some of whom work in the Russian Federation and are now experiencing difficulties. In order to obtain a visa, they have to travel back to Tiflis. In some cases they cannot even afford to do this. And the other side is that these disruptions will also have economic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very much concerned that because of its oil reserves the entire South Caucasus is now at the mercy of commercial interests and has also become a European trouble spot. We should not just wring our hands about this, we should actually do everything in our power. We know from our Georgian friends in national parliaments and from the embassy, which has contacted us, that they really are in dire straits, and that they fear further developments, especially as a wedge is being driven between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which Moscow evidently regards as greater friends. Georgia fears that it will become isolated. So these are truly dramatic events. At the end of December, gas pipelines from Russia to Georgia were even blocked on the alleged grounds that payments had not been made, even though the financing arrangements were quite different. So these are all things which when explained logically sound quite harmless, but which demonstrate to us that the situation has dramatically intensified over the last six months.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore asking the Commission to consider, in conjunction with the Council, whether we could not review and work out a better approach to these conflict situations, based on appropriate decisions which will help people there who want to build a democratic society and seek a peaceful future, and to support Georgia in observing human rights and complying with the other obligations it has entered into within the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very hard in these difficult circumstances for Georgia to observe all its current human rights obligations. That is why we are calling on the Commission to act here. We have made requests and have largely reached cross-party agreement in Parliament that something should be done. We need to work together to come up with solutions which will promote a peaceful way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all have an interest in preserving what is in any case very fragile nationhood and in supporting the first faltering steps towards democracy in this region and in Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to call on the Commissioner to pay even greater attention to this region. Humanitarian aid in particular has a strong stabilising effect in addition to its purely humanitarian function. I am delighted that a delegation from our neighbours, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, is currently visiting Chechnya, and I wish to appeal to the Commissioner to travel to Georgia and Chechnya in the near future and have a close look at the human rights situation there on the spot, just as the Council of Europe is doing in such a thorough way. I appeal to the Commissioner to make our humanitarian aid the number one political priority – the Caucasian region has been a priority for the USA and for Russia for a long time. I say this because I have the feeling that the European Union, apart from Mrs Schleicher, who is doing marvellous work, is failing to take up this challenge. We must not allow ourselves to repeat the mistake we made with the Balkans, where we also woke up to the situation too late, and again attract opprobrium by doing too little too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are the single most important provider of humanitarian assistance to the northern Caucasus and, over the years, we have also been the main provider of humanitarian assistance to the southern Caucasus region.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago exactly I was in North Ossetia and I tried to get into Chechnya but the Russian authorities would not allow this for security reasons. But we are still there.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now our biggest problem is the abduction of the men who worked for one of the organisations we are funding in Chechnya. This, of course, has caused a great deal of concern. The immediate reaction was to withdraw from Chechnya. However, many organisations in Russia have urged us to reconsider this and to come back. As a humanitarian provider this puts us in a dilemma. On the one hand, we need to be there, and we are very pleased that Parliament understands the need for ECHO to operate on the basis of a "remote control operation" in these circumstances. On the other hand, sometimes it is a little too easy for us to tell the organisations we are funding to go there – it is the voluntary staff who have to go. We have to find a balance that is ethically acceptable as a donor. At the moment we are reconsidering whether or not to go back to Chechnya, as we are needed there.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to Georgia. The EU has already expressed serious concern over the Russian Federation's unilateral decision to introduce visa requirements for Georgian citizens. The entire international community, including Russia, is committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the independent states. Applying a special visa regime or allowing exemptions for the inhabitants of secessionist regions could imply support for the legitimacy of their regimes and undermine Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the introduction of visa requirements, Georgia has faced a number of other crises in its relations with Russia in recent months, in particular, over interruptions in gas supplies, the pace of withdrawal of military bases and rescheduling discussions with the Paris Club.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Russian gas supplies to Georgia, we urge that all actions are based exclusively on commercial and contractual considerations. I want to stress that it is in Russia's interests to be seen as an internationally credible and reliable gas supplier. I say this as a European.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally concerned about the humanitarian, social and economic consequences for the Georgian people, as well as the overall stability in the Caucasus. Russia too has no interest in seeing increased instability in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia is a member of the UN, the OSCE and the Council of Europe and it has a partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU. It deserves our support. We call upon the states of the region to use the mechanisms of the OSCE, as well as any other appropriate peaceful instruments, to resolve that dispute quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
