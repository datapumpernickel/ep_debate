Not because the report is so wide ranging, but because the procedure has proved to be extremely difficult. Since the Kingdom of Spain’s initiative to oblige carriers to communicate passenger data was presented, that is since the first document appeared early last year, every month has brought unofficial new versions with the promise of another official one shortly. That dragged on really until the start of this year and since we are coming to the end of this legislative period, I presented a report at the beginning of February, based on the old proposal. Then in the middle of February, the Council suddenly produced a new document as a result of which I then had to prepare a completely new report.</p>
<p class="contents">To the point in hand, my group agrees with the starting point of saying that it may make sense to oblige carriers to communicate data on persons entering the EU from third countries to the competent border control authorities in advance. As presented, however, what the Council has produced is technically far from convincing. It is true that the Council went on to correct itself in many respects. Originally, for example, it wanted airlines to be obliged to report to the authorities anyone who failed to use their return ticket within 48 hours of the planned date. That means that any of us could be suspected of staying somewhere we were not entitled simply because we had not used our ticket, at least not at the planned time. On some points the Council has recognised that it is on the wrong track, but in my opinion it has still not provided the necessary tool. To this day, for example, there has been no dialogue with the carriers concerned as to how this might actually be done technically, what it will cost and who in the end will pay for it. I can only point out that if we want to prevent illegal immigration, we are dealing mainly with third countries that are not exactly wealthy. Think about those third countries, we also know that checking in there is in many cases still done manually, the boarding card is not printed out by computer, but you are given a pre-printed card and the seat number is stuck on to it. In those cases, airlines would be involved in considerable expense. I think that if we have such expectations we must first seek a dialogue with the carriers about how that might be jointly organised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it does not explain at all convincingly whether the border control authorities will really be able to do anything useful with the data provided. In other words, will it make controls easier and more effective? This question has not been examined at all, either in committee meetings or in the document. Moreover, this document contains no justification at all, the Council initiative is unreasoned, there is neither a general justification nor a detailed justification for the individual articles.</p>
<p class="contents">One very central point for which I have still not been given a satisfactory explanation is the question of whether the data collected really will make for more effective controls in the country of entry. That is why my report and the initiative having been rejected in committee, my group will be abstaining in the vote tomorrow, because our position is that basically we find the idea interesting and it may be expedient, but the technical side of it must be cleanly worked. So far, this Council initiative has not done that, and that is why I do not believe we should continue any further down this path. It is my sincere wish that we should take a final vote on this initiative tomorrow and not refer it back to committee. Tomorrow, at any rate, I shall not be proposing that we do this. I believe the road we should take together is that the Commission should submit a sound proposal based on the original Council document (it has already suggested as much itself in a committee meeting) and that we should then have an informed discussion and find a sensible solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said that the expression of the initiative has changed several times and I think that, following my intervention, you are going to say that it has changed once more at the last minute.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in order to be quite clear, the Commission shares the objectives of strengthening controls at external frontiers and combating illegal immigration, which are clearly indicated in the text of the Spanish initiative. It is a matter of harmonising practices, which are already in place in several Member States, concerning the transmission of APIS type data, which is not to be confused with PNR type data. The personal information in question is in fact limited to elements entered in all passengers’ travel documents, which they have to present in any case when crossing external frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the level of data protection offered by the text on which the Parliament is being consulted is sufficiently high and has received the approval of the Article 29 Committee. However, at yesterday’s Justice and Internal Affairs Council, the draft directive was subject to a political agreement following the insertion of amendments proposed by the United Kingdom aimed at authorising the retention of data beyond the period of 24 hours initially laid down in the initiative and their use for more extensive purposes. These amendments, which change the scope of the directive, gave rise to doubts on the part of the Commission, which were expressed in a statement attached to the final text. In this statement, the Commission asserts that the directive should be interpreted in the light of the objectives imposed on it, namely the strengthening of controls at the frontiers and combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in the statement, the Commission regrets that the provisions added at the request of the United Kingdom could not be examined as part of the measures that the Commission has undertaken to present for June 2004. These measures concern the protection of data and the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities in the light in particular of the statement adopted by the European Council on the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is sensitive to the worries of carriers asked to take part in this joint effort. However, it is essential not to overstate the logistical and financial consequences which might result from the implementation of the measures put forward by this proposal. Apart from the fact that the personal data in question are limited to the information mentioned in passengers’ travel documents, which carriers are already obliged to check at the time of boarding, it should be noted that these data will only be transmitted, according to the provisions of the directive, at the request of the competent national authorities. In any case, the Commission is willing to enter into dialogue with the carriers on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the form, to accept this initiative would be to condone the Council’s working method, which consists in constantly amending texts proposed to Parliament. I applaud the work of the rapporteur and his admirable consistency. He was in fact given new versions when he had already drafted his report, so that the earlier text became null and void. This is quite unacceptable. Quite apart from the energy and time that have been wasted, such an attitude betrays a lack of coordination within the Council and contempt for Parliament and the representatives of the people of Europe, which gives us cause for dismay.</p>
<p class="contents">One may then question the result obtained. Is it really effective? Reading the last official text of the Spanish initiative, one comes across the words ‘obligation’ and ‘penalty’ in practically every paragraph. The objective is clearly defined; it involves the fight against illegal immigration. The penalties should, therefore, essentially concern smugglers of clandestine migrants. But no! Penalties and obligations apply to the airlines and we cannot accept that the states should abandon their responsibilities, handing them over to private companies in this way and then penalising them if the work is not done properly. In fact, obliging private companies to collect data with a view to controlling illegal immigration means requiring the carriers to take over the obligations of the states.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of reducing illegal immigration is a legitimate one, but how can the proposed text be effective? There has been no demonstration of its actual operational usefulness, and the fact that only the air carriers are concerned has already weakened its objective. This text, if accepted as it stands, would completely disrupt the work of the airlines, since the transmission of data, which is obligatory for these companies, represents a considerable burden in terms of costs. In some countries, passports are not machine-readable; in other countries, the machines are not yet available: in order to rectify these failings, Member States do not provide for any system of compensation. Also, the system of penalties would be terribly onerous and would not take account of the efforts made by the penalised companies with a view to meeting these obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, illegal immigration must of course be combated, but there are, in my view, many other ways. We therefore, in fact, reject this initiative and we should like the Commission to make us a proposal in the future, a coherent proposal, and one that respects competences and the public’s rights and duties. We trust that the Commission will be able to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, we have already adopted two important decisions at 12 noon today. This House – with good reason – has already clearly rejected any communication of passenger data to the US border protection and security authorities, and, thank God, it has today also rejected collective expulsion through joint European flights.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, may I ask, should a measure raising so many concerns about data protection suddenly become quite unproblematical as soon as it 'only' affects the European Union? Or are all methods now supposed to be acceptable in combating 'illegal' immigration? Do fundamental rights not count any more?</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental right to decide for oneself what is done with one’s personal data is a valuable asset, one with which we must not deal lightly. It is derived very clearly not only from the Member States' national constitutions but also from Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Community's Data Protection Directive sets high standards for the communication of personal data. The Spanish initiative, on the other hand, makes combating illegal immigration through stringent surveillance methods the primary goal – and it is unfortunate that the rapporteur supports this. Yet, as all experience has shown – and this must be made very clear – illegal immigration is tackled not through police repression but solely by establishing peaceful conditions worthy of human dignity in other parts of Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention to allow airline companies to collect and communicate passenger data is extremely problematical for a variety of reasons. Private companies would thus be granted sovereign rights which, until now, have been reserved solely for government agencies in the Member States – for example, in the event of imminent danger or other cases which must be specifically justified. I do not think we should have a situation in Europe in which the movements of millions of people are being spied on. What happens if the data are misused? Let us not even think about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The claim that this measure is designed to combat illegal immigration also lacks any credibility. I think it is patently absurd to assume that the poorest of the poor who come to Europe generally take the plane – the most expensive route. The reality is very different: the large numbers of people who drown as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean or border rivers – and this happens every day – tell a very different story.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to call a halt at last to the authorities' data-collecting zeal, which is spiralling out of control. We should not be embarking on a course which, in the USA, is rightly criticised by all civil liberties organisations. Europe does not need uninterrupted surveillance of its passengers and borders.

This is the feeling I am left with in this matter. Spain’s original proposal, to block illegal immigrants’ path to the mainland, was less fitting than the plan currently proposed. There is a similarity however in that the carriers are still subject to tough requirements. Requirements that are unjust. It cannot after all be the intention that duties of customs agencies are simply transferred to the carriers without proper debate, without a mandate. If that happens, it should happen so that the effort involved and the financial damage are kept to a minimum. This was still not the case in the last proposal either.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important however is the point that carriers have to know where they stand, they have to know with what legislation they have to comply. It is the responsibility of the legislator to communicate this clearly and to remove any duplications or contradictions. This is a crucial point in the discussion of the requirements the American authorities are imposing on carriers. At the moment it seems as though airlines flying to the United States are working in a legal minefield. Any step to one side or the other can have undesirable and far-reaching consequences. It is not a worthwhile contribution to their position to impose a further set of requirements regarding the passing on of information. Which is why we are not sorry about the rejection of Spain’s initiative. While this may not necessarily create a clear situation for the airlines, it does prevent an accumulation of different obligations. It is up to the responsible agencies to lay down clear and uniform requirements of the information that airlines are to provide in the interest of everyone on this and the other side of the ocean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
