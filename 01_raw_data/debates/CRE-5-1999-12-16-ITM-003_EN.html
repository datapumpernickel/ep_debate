Is it really only a question of applying current law? I think not. You had the opportunity to grant an exemption. You failed to do so. That was a political decision. In France, for example, the legislator has decided in the light of bitter experience to set book prices by law. That is a <span class="underline">political</span> decision. When we talk of cultural diversity and the promotion of literary and scientific production, then we are talking politics. When we sense that some people – I do not mean you, but others in the Commission – have replaced <span class="italic">Our Father </span>with <span class="italic">Our shareholder value</span>, then we are talking politics.</p>
<p class="contents">We have since gone into the question in greater detail. I have said that there is a case for the decision not to grant an exemption. But then we need national fixed book prices which work. I am most grateful that you accept that export and re-import rules are needed. In the final analysis, that is a general legal principle that a legal situation cannot be circumvented. What we need, however, are import rules. That is the decisive point which we still need to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">How should import rules be worded so that national fixed book prices are not circumvented? If we can reach agreement on this point, then I think we will have solved the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is that we seek a solution on the basis of French legislation. There is no point in having a patchwork quilt of different legal regulations in the European Union. My request to the Commission is this: we have a legal regulation in France which works. Please allow the others, including Germany and Austria, to find a regulation on a legal or contractual basis which works in a similar manner.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to point out that the Commission started to address the cross-border system of fixed book prices in force in Germany and Austria a long time before the protest made by the Austrian company <span class="italic">Libro</span> in 1996. In fact, the proceedings in question began in 1993, with the Commission being notified of the cross-border agreements between German and Austrian publishers. This was followed in 1994, 1995 and 1996 respectively, by the protests of two sellers of German books and the Austrian federal workers’ association, an organisation which also has the task of defending consumer interests. The Commission has not yet completed its consideration of the cases in question and therefore cannot bring forward the decision that will be taken on the proceedings currently underway. It is the Commission’s duty not to discuss, apart from with those involved, an individual case on competition law where proceedings are open, but it can talk about the general points raised in an oral question, which is something I am very happy to do in your presence in this House. </p>
<p class="contents">National systems of fixed book prices may be based on national regulations or an agreement between companies, and in the case in point, between publishers and booksellers. It is impossible to make an exact comparison of such regulations and an agreement between companies: indeed, different provisions of the Treaty are applied. Systems based on regulations must be considered on the basis of Article 28 of the Treaty, whereas agreements between companies must comply with Article 81 of the Treaty. In both cases, the case-law of the Court of Justice must obviously be respected. The Commission believes that national systems of fixed book prices, based on agreements between companies, are compatible with Community competition rules if they do not significantly affect trade between Member States. In these cases where trade is affected, Article 81 is not applied. As for systems based on regulations, each Member State is free to adopt regulations as long as they are compatible with the principle, sanctioned by the Treaty, of the free movement of goods. This choice is left to the national authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">More particularly, as far as French legislation is concerned – which Mr Rothley has mentioned – and as it was drafted at the time, in the judgement of 10 January 1995 on the Leclerc case, no. 229/83 “Au blé vert”, the Court of Justice decreed that, in the sphere of national legislation establishing a fixed book price system, rules which establish that the publisher’s fixed price must be observed, as regards the sale of books published in the Member State itself, and which are reimported prior to export to another Member State, constitute measures with an effect equivalent to import restrictions, which are prohibited under Article 28 (ex Article 30) of the Treaty, unless there are well-grounded reasons to believe that the aforementioned books have been exported with the sole aim of reimporting them with the intention of evading the aforementioned law. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that such legislation, in Germany and Austria, would not contribute to the harmonisation of European law. Indeed, there are various Member States that have never had a system of fixed book prices and there are other Member States that had such a system and put an end to it, for example Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom which, as we know, have the same language as another Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact, Mr President, Commissioner, that I am addressing you here and now in German demonstrates that fixed book prices are not just a national problem; they are a cross-border issue which also affects a series of linguistic enclaves outside Germany and Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Books are cultural assets, writing is the first recorded form of the language, of linguistic identity, and I think that, however important it is to comply with competition standards, the cultural aspect must be considered equally important and given equal status. Even if current legislation within the framework of the European Union does not yet allow for cross-border regulations in this area, I hope that we shall arrive at this form of regulation in the future, especially since the German and Austrian Ministers for Culture defined and documented this issue as such for cross-border action in February last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that a regulation needs to be found to protect authors and to protect publishers, if not in the form of current cross-border measures, then in the form of national regulations. The problem of imports, be they of a contractual or legislative nature, is a crucial element in this respect. I hope that the rapprochement to date between the Commission and the European Parliament, which has already taken up this matter several times during the last parliamentary term, be it in the Committee on Culture or in plenary, will continue. And as Mr Rothley has already said: it will not do to have a patchwork quilt in Europe in the future; on the contrary, we need a sensible regulation, which may not be optimal but which meets the demands of the professional organisations in question. The French model could offer a workable, viable solution for the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense we hope, Commissioner, that you and the Commission will be able to grant Parliament’s wish, the wish which it has expressed here and in the documents of this legislation.</p>

There is much which needs to be said, but my colleagues have already contributed a great deal to the debate on fixed book prices. As far as I am concerned, the first point is that we need to stress the importance of the specialist book trade, we need to build on quality, not quantity, we are in immediate need of a specialist trade, a supply of specialist literature, as far as the sciences and technical books are concerned, and of personal service and advice. I also believe that it is in the interests of the promotion of SMEs, the preservation of which is an important factor in the European Union, and which is practised in the case of the specialist book trade in a very positive and demonstrative manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it is very important to refer to the cross-border language area. We are always talking about the diversity of European culture and about the diversity of languages, which are growing together but which still need to retain their own identity. It is therefore imperative to be able to sell these books easily across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important point for me is the cultural aspect of books and society’s obligation towards literature and art; it is precisely now, in an era of new media, that books need to be specially promoted and supported. Art and culture are, as we know, a very important economic factor and so therefore are books. When we look at printers, publishers, translators, the trade and much more besides, then we know how important the book trade is, how important art is, including for employment. That should not mean, however, that we regard art and culture as purely economic factors. Art and culture need social support. They are a necessity, we have a responsibility towards them and we cannot deal with them in that respect under the normal rules of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to urge you, Commissioner, to put the interests of large undertakings after culture, cultural diversity and the specialist trade. Make your decision in the case of books in accordance with the principles of French law and allow the German and Austrian book trade sufficient time to adapt fixed book prices to these principles. I believe that this will fulfil a very important cultural brief, whereby the economy is perhaps only left standing temporarily. I think that this, too, is a gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, and I think I can speak on behalf of everyone here present, the availability of information is essential to our democracy and, as has been stated before, to maintain our level of cultural development. I think that I would especially like to highlight this cultural aspect i.e. the cultural significance of books. This is exactly the reason why books should have an exemption position in cultural policy. </p>
<p class="contents">In most countries, books are not subsidised, unlike other forms of culture, but this is not necessary. In my opinion, the government should mainly play a stimulating role. This is why in a large number of countries, including the Netherlands, which I represent, a decision has been made in favour of fixed book prices. In this way, we can avoid a scenario where mutual competition is so unfair that the wide and varied supply would diminish and that the easy access to information would be lost. </p>
<p class="contents">You too have just noted yourself that Member States need to indicate themselves what measures they will take, whether they will conclude agreements or adopt legislation, but, Commissioner, language transcends boundaries. This is why I would also like to ask you three questions concerning the cross-border fixed book price. For various countries in Europe, this is an urgent matter. Some things have just come to light regarding Germany and Austria, but also in the Netherlands, activities in this sphere are closely monitored. This is important for the Dutch linguistic region but also, of course, for other linguistic regions. </p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the large-scale mobility of people and new developments via <span class="italic">e-commerce</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>which lead to a gradual fading of the borders. Do you not share my view that the lack of cross-border price fixing or, for example, its abolition, especially for small businesses – and with this I am back on the subject of employment – entails the risk that national regulations will be cancelled out by extensive importing? There is a risk that small bookshops will disappear, especially in the countryside and in smaller towns, and that with it, accessibility will decrease. </p>
<p class="contents">My second question to you concerns the key significance of cultural integration, as is also included in the preamble to the oral questions. I actually feel that this aspect is given too little consideration. Cultural integration which transcends national borders is restricted if the fixed book price were to be scrapped and it is of particular importance to promote it in countries which share the same language. I think that fixed book prices are exactly the right instrument in this case. I fully agree with the ladies and gentlemen. The rules which are being drafted now should not be a hotchpotch. Each country is coming up with something but it would be preferable to find better solutions for this. I would like to urge you too to take swift action. This is a very long-winded affair. In my own profession, I have experienced exactly that for years and years. I think the time is right to take some decisions. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to express my concern regarding these detours because do you not think that because of these detours, it is easy to undermine the fixed book price from other Member States in the same linguistic region and that it is not a very effective means of safeguarding the special value of the book as a cultural object and the special significance of the book market for culture? </p>
<p class="contents">These are three points which I would like to highlight. I believe that the consumer is not at all interested in lower prices. The consumer wants quality which should be sound and widely available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You understand the importance of the subject. I shall not repeat everything that has already been said and I may therefore not need the full seven and a half minutes. You may perhaps even see that as an advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">For me personally, cross-border fixed book prices would represent a possible answer to the possible question: “What exactly is a European cultural policy? What does it mean and what could it do?” Apart from the market and competition, we also have Article 151. This article, as we know, contradicts Article 81. As Mr Rothley has already mentioned, an exemption would have been possible. There was a transition period, but there was no exemption. My question is, was that a political or was that a purely legal decision? Is this Europe of the regions, are the slogans “cultural diversity” and “the Europe of common language areas” no more than election promises? Is no serious work being carried out on them? From a purely legal point of view, Commissioner, you must intervene in this case, in the case of cross-border fixed book prices. I do not understand, however, why Article 81 is valid for culture, but Article 151 is not valid for competition. The paragraphs have different weights, legal texts are interpreted and the side which has more weight also has more merit. Such is life.</p>
<p class="contents">But I see politics as an attempt to even things out, as an effort to strike a balance. I am against neither the market nor competition, even if it may appear so. As an artist I was exposed to competition day in, day out, I still am and sometimes it is a matter of keeping one’s head above water. Perhaps that is precisely why I am in favour of competition, but I am also in favour of a European cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I now have a problem Commissioner. Sometimes we are not talking about the same things because we are using different studies. You have just reminded us that the United Kingdom, like Ireland, has no book price fixing, despite the fact that they are the same language area. You are forgetting that the huge American market also dominates these two countries to a large extent. You are also forgetting the culturally different approach to books and that there is now a different approach to books in each Member State. I am countering with arguments from a French study, which the Commission has only accepted in part, if at all. You have been so kind as to promise to let me have a list of your studies, the studies on which you base your information and make your decisions, because as long as we are using different studies, we will be talking about different things and will not arrive at any conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, neither the Council nor the Commission has taken over the cultural brief in this European Union <span class="italic">in toto</span>. This is not meant as a slight on the promotion programmes, God forbid. They are wonderful, they are a huge step in the right direction. That is a hackneyed phrase, but I really mean it. It is not enough, however; a European cultural policy is missing. The European dimension of the promotional culture programme is embodied in books to the highest degree and it does not cost the Union a penny extra, it only costs the consumer or rather the ‘dear reader’.</p>
<p class="contents">Books are not therefore just goods; they also have a cultural value, on that we are all agreed. But what is the Commission doing about this? I too am unable to absolve you, Commissioner for Competition, from responsibility for cultural policy. We must not all decide strictly in a single direction without looking first to the left or right for ways of bringing things together. I understand that a book is not a car and I thought that we had a legal basis for that. However, that appears not to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to consider our motion for a resolution jointly. We are all agreed that this could be a sign that competition does not behave as culture’s adversary, but as culture’s partner and that it can behave in support of cultural policy. It can also be a sign that what we might call, on the basis of the French law, ‘European’ fixed book prices also give the Nation States a clear hint that they should assume responsibility rather than giving the standard response: ‘that is being decided in Brussels’. Then you could also take a huge step in the right direction!</p>

<p class="contents">Through this procedure, which was based on respect for European competition rules, the Commission was actually aiming to challenge the fixed book price system. Among other benefits, this system allows literary production to be supported and the survival of small publishing houses and bookshops to be assured. The European Parliament reacted strongly by adopting virtually unanimously, on 20 November 1998, a resolution which defended fixed book prices and which called on the Commission to bring its Community policy on book price agreements into line with cultural requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Under pressure from the French and German Governments, the Council used Parliament’s position to adopt a resolution on 8 February 1999 demanding, in particular, the continuation of the existing fixed book price systems. The steadfastness shown by the Council and Parliament led the Commission to acknowledge that competition rules could not be systematically applied in the book sector. It therefore confirmed that it had no intention of challenging the contractual agreements concluded in certain Member States or national laws such as the Lange Act in France. Nevertheless, some months later, and after the installation of the new Commission, the Directorate-General for Competition is once again pushing the Commission to act against cross-border agreements and fixed book prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this new offensive by the Commission, which is bent on deregulation, it was important to react very quickly. I am therefore delighted about this debate and the new position being taken by the European Parliament on this issue. In its motion for a resolution, my group stresses that books are primarily cultural assets and must not therefore be subject to the competition rules in the same way as all other goods. Their unique nature must be fully recognised in the context of the EU’s cultural policy which we are trying to develop. This is why we hope that Parliament will confirm its position of November 1998 in order to defend cross-border agreements and fixed book prices. Why will the Commission not take up our proposal to extend the fixed book price system to all Member States? In order to take account of technological developments, the directive on e-commerce should also include the requirements indicated by the various national laws on fixed book prices to prevent this system from being circumvented.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I hope that the Council will show the same steadfastness as this House in protecting and promoting the fixed book price system. This system, as noted by our motion for a resolution, is better than any other at improving the production and distribution of literary works without eliminating competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Dutch poet Lucebert wrote “Everything of value is defenceless.” These words are of great value in the debate on fixed book prices. </p>
<p class="contents">In fixed book pricing, there is certainly no ‘sacred cow’ for book lovers. With words to the same effect, former Commissioner Van Miert once lashed out against those advocating the maintenance of fixed book pricing. He very conveniently overlooked the fact that those against fixed book pricing very probably selected the market mechanism as if it were their “golden calf”. </p>
<p class="contents">The instrument of fixed book pricing and the corresponding restriction in exploiting the opportunities afforded by parallel importing reduce competition. Cross-subsidisation will occur between good and bad expenditure. The abolition of fixed book pricing results in increased competition and lower prices. This would be in the interests of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">This line of reasoning seems to be sound, but it falls short on two important counts. In the first place, the government is responsible for running society as a whole. In carrying out this responsibility, it is completely unacceptable to society as a whole if it honours certain specific interests unilaterally and neglects others. In this discussion, the government cannot just have the consumer’s partial interests at heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the reasoning is based on the implied assumption that price is the only thing that matters to the consumer. This is a rather one-sided view. I have never met a consumer on the street with such blinkered views. He only exists in theory. Indeed, the real consumer also takes into account quality, diversity, accessibility and adequate distribution of the total supply of books. That fixed book pricing only benefits publishers and bookshops is thus a fable and anyone who has read a story in a children’s book will know that fables are not entirely true. </p>
<p class="contents">People in favour of the abolition of fixed book pricing should also be aware of the consequences. It is highly likely that diversity in the supply of bookshops will suffer. Mass culture will be promoted. This is, in the long run, fatal for the cultural education of citizens. In my country, the Netherlands, there is also the consideration that fixed book pricing protects our relatively small linguistic region. </p>
<p class="contents">You could, in defence, bring up the argument that it is not up to the government to tutor or stimulate its citizens into cultural education and it therefore has no responsibility in terms of the richness in the variety of books supplied. The government should abstain from exercising any influence and the market mechanism will balance out supply and demand. This sounds neutral but it is not. Implicitly, this point of view sees the effect of market forces as being the only right outcome. In our society, the introduction of market forces seems to be the highest goal in virtually all areas of policy. This viewpoint is a direct result of reversing ends and means. The outcome of a liberal, strictly market-conforming policy is, by definition, not free from value judgement. With such a policy, the government is making just as much of a value statement of what it believes is right or wrong. It is especially important in the cultural sector that factors other than financial ones are part of the equation because things of great value also happen to be very vulnerable. </p>
<p class="contents">If the free market forces take over, we will soon have to switch Lucebert’s words around to “Everything is once more without value”. We need to avoid this situation at all costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in my own country, the United Kingdom, we had a long political debate over the value of resale price maintenance applied to books. That debate ended with the abolition of the book price-fixing agreement. There is no evidence from the United Kingdom of less choice, higher prices or of any reduction in specialist bookshops. Indeed, the number of books sold and the number of publishing houses producing them appears to be increasing. This is surely a good thing. At least it seems so to me since I think that books exist to be read, or certainly that was the conclusion I reached when I studied English literature at university.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, under the principles of subsidiarity, if a Member State wishes to impose resale price maintenance on books, so be it. Moreover, if two or more Member States wish to create an internal area of joint resale price maintenance in respect of books, good luck to them. But this has to be compatible with the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Any such statutory system must have no effect as regards books sold outside the limits of the Member States' jurisdiction. Nor should it affect books brought in or brought back into it, an increasingly widespread and popular means of book-selling developing in conjunction with e-commerce, which is entirely in accordance with the principles of the single market, and provides enormous opportunities for small niche businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Any suggestion that this should take place is illiberal. It is contrary to the principles of the single market and, in my view, is de facto a form of censorship, and artificially rationing the supply of books in favour of the better-off. Furthermore, I believe that it prejudices a proper and legitimate aspect of intra-European trade, threatening to reduce the movement of literature across Europe to the level of pornography sent through the post, so I am reliably informed, in unmarked brown manilla envelopes, and in the free world reducing the legitimate trade in books to the level of smuggling in and out of eastern Europe of so-called subversive literature. I, for one at least, am not in favour of that because I believe it is old-fashioned, illiberal, reactionary and, in its longer-term effect, philistine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My parents had a small book shop in a small town. There was not much to do there, but anyway. I can assure you that, without book price fixing, we could not have survived, which is why, Commissioner, your statements can only be felt as a disappointment and your presentation has made it clear that the question of cross-border book price fixing threatens to turn into an endless saga.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a truism to say that books are not goods like butter, eggs and cheese and that they are a cultural asset which cannot be dealt with under competition law like butter, eggs and cheese. That does not alter the fact that there is printed matter which does not meet this claim. However, the exception should not be seen here as the rule, nor should we take as a yardstick the fact that there are books which earn a great deal of money. Best-sellers are, indeed, the exception to the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not right to see books merely as an economic asset. Luckily, your predecessor, who represented this view, was clearly unable to make it stick. So we still have reason to hope, but the danger has clearly not been averted, far from it. Hence our urgent request, to which we expect a clear answer, Commissioner, that books should be seen as cultural products. Obviously, national book price fixing systems are, thankfully, not disputed; consequently, the possibility must be granted for regulations such as those which now exist, for single cross-border language areas. What has been preserved over a hundred years in the German-speaking area between Austria, Germany and Switzerland, what has permitted a large diversity of titles and has ensured that competition is not excluded and that there is a comprehensive supply of large and small bookshops in both town and country, should not be sacrificed to the unbridled and extortionate pressure of the market leaders, not in book shops, not in the mail order business and not in e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">As a cultural asset, books have the right to equal status in the various channels, including sales channels, to the reader. The French regulation which, in addition to the national price fixing system, also includes regulations on imports, exports and re-imports, offers a way forward which is compatible with the EU and which has proven its worth in practice, which is why, Commissioner, the European Parliament is waiting, across the group divide as you will no doubt have seen, for the go-ahead for a similar legal or contractual regulation for Germany and Austria, in order to bring this endless saga to a happy ending at last. Or do you prefer to expose yourself to the reproach that the Commission is a committee of philistines? You should spare yourself this sad reputation. You have to decide between culture and commerce. Please opt for culture.</p>

Listening to the debate here today, I can see that what was agreed between the Austrian and Germany book trade and the Commission has still found no place in this debate. I can see, including from the speeches this week, that there is obviously a rapprochement here, on the basis of the recognition of the national book price fixing system and a regulation based on French law, which demonstrates, Commissioner Monti, that you are prepared to weigh the cultural aspect, which has formed part of the EC Treaty since Maastricht, against Article 85 of the EC Treaty, which requires you, as Commissioner for competition, to ensure that there are equal conditions of competition, thereby helping to ensure that consumers do not lose out in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, how can it be done? I am convinced that we are on the right track here. We do not need to accuse the Commissioner of philistinism, because he is just doing his job as keeper of the treaties. I think that if we can find an economically reasonable solution which the publishing houses agree with, if we can find a solution which recognises cultural language areas, if we can find a solution which does not incorporate the maximum limitation on competition within the level playing field required under Article 85, then we are on the right track towards a reasonable regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, therefore, I support the motion for a resolution as tabled here by Mr Rothley. However, reference to the Commission’s obligation to comply with competition regulations is missing. This should be added, otherwise we shall lose credibility and we shall put Mr Monti in an awkward position which he certainly does not deserve, because I have confidence in your informed judgement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Account has even been taken of recent developments. I should therefore like to stress just a few points once again.</p>
<p class="contents">First, politics means shaping; politics means shaping the habitat and coexistence of people. Secondly, the book trade is more to us than simply a sales network for books. It creates identities and books create identities. Thirdly, the question at issue for me is not merely cross-border trade between Austria and Germany, although that is the starting point; it is the question of the role of language areas and the role of cultural areas. For us the relevant market is the market to which the book relates and it cannot be reduced to national borders. For us it is, in this respect, the language and cultural area, hence the importance of cross-border fixed book prices. It is obvious to us Austrians that a national regulation alone is not enough and that we also need an import clause and an export clause and to use the French model as a basis, because the language area and the cultural area transcend our national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said that you had never seen the need for conflict between culture and the market. I share this view, provided that we state clearly what we mean by market and what we mean by the purpose of competition policy. You said at your hearing that you were striving for competition policy and the market to further develop into a social market economy. A social and ecological market economy includes protection for cultural assets and signals market definition. This is precisely our debate, which is why I appeal to you to define clearly the relevant market in this context as a language and cultural area, to clarify import clauses together with the possibility for national regulation and to apply the French law to your judgement and considerations.</p>

Louise Weiss said in her superb opening address to the European Parliament after the first direct elections that there should not only be European pigs and cows, although cows are particularly topical at present, but that there should also be European people. However, European people are not the same throughout the Union and European culture thrives on its diversity. This diversity is the point at issue. It is always dangerous when politics fails to take note of realities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the book trade, there is not only the reality of the internal market and the nation state; there is also the reality of language areas. It would be criminal to exclude the reality of language areas. Commissioner, I represent Bavaria here. Bavaria probably has more in common culturally with Austria, which is represented by Mr Karas, and with the South Tyrol, which is represented by Mr Ebner, than with many regions in northern Germany. Nonetheless, there is a uniform German language area. This uniform German language area cannot concentrate purely on the national market or the EU market and the reality lies somewhere between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">To recognise this reality is to recognise Europe as it is. This is a prerequisite to successful integration. The fact that we here in Parliament have spoken out so vehemently and with a large majority on this matter for years now is not a sign of eccentricity; it shows how strongly this debate worries the people. I warn the Commission that its justified concerns about market laws allows it to forget, so to speak, that our citizens expect more of Europe, that they expect a cultural Europe, which is why I am strongly in favour of negotiating a compromise here, of giving the Austrian and German book trade time to implement the solution which is in the offing. We need time. That is fundamental. I take the view that the real issue here is the legitimisation and the future of European unification. The issue is simply whether or not people will be able, in future, to say in Latin – another threatened minority language – <span class="italic">Civis europaeus sum</span>.</p>

I would like to assure the participants in the debate that the Commission, and myself personally, attach a lot of importance, as you do, to culture and books, and we recognise the cultural importance of books and are ready to take into account these specific features. Mr Karas mentioned that I have already stated that I wish competition policy to be an element of the social market economy: I confirm this and ask you all not to consider competition as an abstract concept and the citizens’ enemy. </p>
<p class="contents">Competition is the main ally of individual citizens. Competition’s main aim is to safeguard consumer interests from the point of view both of prices and quality, as well as to safeguard small and medium-sized businesses against the excesses of large businesses, in many cases. For this reason, just as I am prepared to give full recognition to the importance of culture, I am asking you not to become intellectual victims of an approach whereby competition is not a major ally of citizens. The task of competition is to combat cartels, the abuse of dominant positions and mergers, and to create more possibilities for economic freedom, and we know that economic freedom is often accompanied by civil freedom too, as shown by the past experience of countries which did not have economic freedom. I therefore believe that there is room for a harmonious interaction between cultural policy and competition policy, without creating futile and forced counter-stances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN) </span>The evidence provided by Lord Inglewood, which can be found in other countries as well, shows that the abolition of a fixed price system does not necessarily bring about disruptive consequences in terms of prices and quality of books. Yet I want it to be very clear that the Commission is not working for the abolition of fixed price systems for books as such. Frankly, Mrs Juncker, I wonder whether you and I were in the same room when I spoke because I am very surprised that you say that the Commission wants to eliminate the price maintenance system.

<p class="contents">“The Commission believes that national systems of fixed book prices, based on agreements between companies, are compatible with Community competition rules if they do not significantly affect trade between Member States.” I also said: “As for systems based on regulations” – that is, the other possibility, not agreements but regulations – “each Member State is free to adopt regulations as long as they are compatible with the principle, sanctioned by the Treaty, of the free movement of goods”. Therefore, please, let us not depict the Commission as an institution which sets out to do things that in reality it has no intention of doing. I have repeatedly said that we will not oppose, nor can we oppose, fixed book price systems at national level. We must only prevent telling distortions arising from the fact that this is a cross-border issue. </p>
<p class="contents">I have already said, as regards the specific German/Austrian case, where proceedings are on-going, that unfortunately I cannot discuss it in detail here. I can, however, assure you that I made an enormous effort, in my first three months in office, to meet the parties concerned and pinpoint prospects for a positive outcome. In this respect, I found Mr Langen’s intervention constructive, as<span class="bold"> </span>he<span class="bold"> </span>seems to recognise that such a prospect exists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EN) </span>Finally, Mrs Echerer reminded us all in this room that we have different backgrounds. She is right. Unfortunately, my background is not that of an actor. I would not dare to define myself as a man of culture, far from it, but I spent my life until five years ago as a university professor and my life has been spent between books as an instrument for work and they are something I deeply respect and love. I believe I am as sensitive as anybody here to the importance of books, of culture. It is simply my job to try to preserve all the positive values that are embedded in them, avoiding at the same time some excesses that may be to the detriment of the reader.</p>
