<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the regulation to be voted on tomorrow on the application of the provisions of the Århus Convention to Community institutions will force us to confront decisions which are very political in nature. It concerns important environmental legislation which relates to access to environmental information and the right of citizens to participate in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The Århus Convention, ratified in the European Community by the Member States and the EU, will be implemented by means of three directives, for which the first two pillars have already passed through the codecision procedure and conciliation. During the entire process I have been rapporteur for the reports on the Århus Convention. These pillars concern the transparency of environmental information and the Community’s right to be involved. The third directive, access to justice, will probably not go ahead, because the Member States have not achieved consensus in the matter and there has been a general feeling that the project should be shelved. The right to access to justice has also proven to be the biggest problem area in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always stressed the importance of the rights of citizens regarding matters of the environment. Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental component of our own safety. The regulation now before us, which extends the scope of the provisions of the Århus Convention to Community level, is nevertheless in danger of acquiring some worrying features. The European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, when it voted, clearly altered the focus of the provisions, taking the Convention to what in my opinion was an undesirable level. It is one thing to monitor and regulate how, for example, an authority applies and interprets the provisions of environmental legislation but quite another to monitor and regulate how a democratically elected legislator goes about his or her task. The committee’s design as it stands would in practice give all non-governmental organisations that fit the description very loosely the right to take the Community institutions to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, thus according them a kind of watchdog status with regard to said institutions. As a politician, I am not, however, prepared to delegate in this way the power democratically bestowed on me and controlled by the people, and I hope that tomorrow this matter will be put right in the plenary vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The most crucial areas in tomorrow’s vote relate to Amendments 22, 24 and 25. Article 230 of the Treaty allows citizens to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities if a decision affects the citizen directly and individually, which is only right and proper from the point of view of democracy. The position of Parliament’s Committee on the Environment now means, however, that any NGO within the EU can evade this provision by requesting an internal review, which the Community institution must reply to with a formal decision. This decision, in conjunction with Amendment 25, will clear the way for examining the legality of the original decision, and not only its procedural but also its substantive legality, and will thus give NGOs the power ultimately to evaluate the work of the Community’s institutions. This would automatically allow them to take the Community’s institutions to court, and, with such supreme authority, oversee our work.</p>
<p class="contents">In a democracy it is the people who are the highest authority, and the decision-makers whom they elect implement their will. Now, however, we would be placing NGOs above the people and that is difficult for me to accept. This is a political matter and one of principle. Please do not misunderstand me: we need environmental organisations, and the world would be a much poorer place if NGOs had not justifiably raised many important questions. Nevertheless, what they are now trying to drive through for themselves, with some heavy lobbying, is disquieting.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the definition of NGOs in the regulation is a very loose one, and for that reason I have tabled two amendments for the House which set out the criteria in greater detail. The first states that an NGO must have operated in more than one EU country for at least two years. The other amendment adds the words ‘compliant with the law’ to the definition. These amendments are essential for requests for reviews to remain within controllable limits and in order to obtain additional criteria for the nature of the work of NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of our committee in this report have tabled amendments which I am happy to agree with. I myself have emphasised the importance, for example, of the quality and comparability of environmental information. Similarly, I support the democratic nature and transparency of our decision-making whenever I can.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, however, that is all I want from the environmental organisations. If they themselves complied with what they demand of us, if they were more transparent in their activities and funding procedures, and if they gave less misleading and mistaken information, we would not need to impose these restrictions and criteria. From the global point of view, it has been disappointing to observe that NGOs do not by any means always disseminate the correct information or correct what has been shown to be mistaken information.</p>
<p class="contents">A good example of this is the letter that came this week from the biggest environmental organisations, which gives the wrong picture of the opportunity that is possibly now opening up to them of access to justice in court. They mention that industrial companies are able to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice, and now this legislation would only bring them to the same level. The letter fails to mention that the environmental organisations do by no means aspire to the same level as companies, regarding which there is a call for this decision to affect them ‘directly and individually’, in other words, as an interested party. Instead, the environmental organisations should now be able to choose, within the entire Union and ignoring criteria relating to interested parties, which area they are interested in. It was misleading that this essential detail was left unsaid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Århus agreement is an important part of viable democracy. For that reason, citizens’ rights should not abuse the right to access to justice in order to put the brakes on projects or provide a forum for organisations’ fund collecting campaigns. Neither can I accept that the work of political decision-makers should flounder amid endless complaints from organisations. It is not appropriate to resort to the right to appeal incessantly. Abuses would undermine those citizens’ rights which we originally set out to defend. Accordingly, at the plenary reading we now have to be careful regarding how the Community actually applies the right to access to justice. I hope that Parliament will move closer to the Council’s view, which I hold to be a balanced one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regulation has been proposed in parallel to the decision to ratify the Århus Convention, which contains obligations not only for the public authorities in the Member States, but also for the Community institutions. Consequently, the provisions on this matter already in existence needed to be supplemented.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the proposal covers all three parts of the Convention, namely access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community became a contracting party to the Convention in May 2005, just before the second conference of the parties in Almaty. At that time, the first reading of the regulation had already taken place and political agreement had been achieved at Council level in view of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position improves and completes the initial Commission proposal from numerous points of view. It also incorporates, either literally or materially, many of the amendments which the European Parliament formulated at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">To be specific, as far as access to environmental information is concerned, a new Article 6 is proposed which refers to the application of the exemptions relating to access to environmental information, as proposed in the European Parliament's amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position also incorporates elements of the European Parliament's amendments relating to more detailed requirements for public participation in the preliminary preparation of plans and programmes relating to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards access to justice, the Council simplified the criteria and the procedures on the basis of which non-governmental organisations can file a request for an internal review of deeds of Community institutions. It is worth noting that the organisations in question no longer need to act at Community level in order to exercise this right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in a position to accept the changes in question, given that the current wording retains the obligation of the organisations in question to have environmental protection at Community level as their basic objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was also able to accept changes to the provisions which refer to the outcome of the internal review and the facility for non-governmental organisations to take recourse to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council effected the changes in question in a bid to avoid a text which might clash with the rules of the Convention concerning the right of access of individuals and groups of individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, endorses the Council's intention in this case, especially given that the common position is in keeping with the Århus Convention, which allows the contracting parties to adopt criteria for public access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that agreement will soon be reached on this specific proposal. We have already come a long way from the overall application of the Århus Convention and the adoption of this regulation will prove just how much we wish to apply it to the Community institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Århus Convention, which is already being transposed in some countries, such as Spain, is clearly a victory for the possibility of transparency, training and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am extremely worried that positions that move away from the common sense demonstrated by the Council and from the Commission's position intend to give non-governmental organisations excessive legal capacity, in my view, as Mrs Korhola has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that democracy must be symmetrical. It is not logical that non-governmental organisations should have more rights than local councils in this field. Neither do I believe that regions can have a particular capacity which we here would give them.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is a principle in law, that of direct interest, which has been the subject of much debate in legal history and which is normally applied to the family or to certain problems that occur in the territory in question. Nevertheless, I believe that applying direct interest to any NGO in Europe would take us into the realm of infinite law, and we would have no idea where that would end.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this may create a huge number of problems, above all because, as we know, sustainable development requires knowledge of the direct resource, because not every case is the same. The main principle, which we have raised here many times, is that the concept of sustainable development is integral, it must relate to a specific place, and in one place certain things can be done for economic and social reasons which cannot be done in another place.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea, therefore, that certain NGOs, often not located in the relevant place, can demand this right by virtue of their interest in the environment, seems to me to be excessive. I therefore agree with the Council’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur and the other Members to apply this Convention to the mechanisms currently in place in the Member States and the Community institutions with a view to guaranteeing the legitimate right to environmental information and justice. In this regard, we believe that better access to information and greater participation by the public in decision-making will make it possible to apply those decisions more effectively and will contribute to increasing awareness of environmental problems amongst the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention will have to enhance transparency, responsibility and good governance in such diverse areas of public action as energy, agriculture, transport and tourism, by recognising a series of rights aimed at guaranteeing the effective participation of the citizens in public decision-making processes. That information must provide sufficient knowledge to allow them to participate actively and consistently in the different administrative procedures. Furthermore, the right to promote the administrative or legal resources they consider appropriate must be recognised when it is judged that those rights have been violated by public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific aspects of the report, I believe that in relation to access to justice for NGOs, the latter should not have excessively restrictive requirements, such as the requirement to work at international level and, above all, that of not having been registered for more than two years for the presentation of requests. I believe that in many cases that would be a serious injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with a view to ensuring that justice is universal, I believe that we should reject the idea of the European Investment Bank being able to deny access to environmental information, since the Århus Convention states that exceptions must be interpreted narrowly and the inclusion of the term ‘banking’ enlarges the notion of confidentiality. In fact, the directive on public access to environmental information does not lay down specific rules for banks. I would like the Commission to agree on these two specific issues because I believe them to be the most important ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this Regulation will be applied as soon as possible, in order to guarantee access to justice on all environmental issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regulation enhances democracy in the environmental area. The provisions of Arhus with regard to access to information, participation in decision-making and judicial access for environmental issues will apply across the whole of the EU. From now on, not only the Member States, but also the Community institutions, will need to comply with these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Accessing justice, as provided for in the Arhus Convention, entails that the public must have the option of bringing environmental decisions taken by the EU institutions before the European Court. At the moment, citizens with an environmental interest or environmental NGOs have no opportunity of raising any issues with the Court because they are rarely affected personally – the conditions included in the EC Treaty apply to access to justice, something that is often easier to demonstrate in the case of economic operators. It is, of course, important for NGOs to enjoy the same level of access to justice, although the way in which this has been fleshed out by the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – particularly in Amendments 22 and 25 – is liable to attract some criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">To prevent many hundreds of NGOs from bringing minor objections before the court, amendments are used to prescribe strict conditions for NGOs who can make a request for internal review. Even with those conditions – that are now before us and that the rapporteur has presented to us separately – in place, there will be many NGOs who can submit requests of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the intention to bring every single environmental decision taken by the European institutions before the Court, for that generates legal uncertainty and will only increase the European Court’s heavy workload. On the other hand, at times when there is serious doubt as to a certain environmental decision, it must be possible to raise this with the relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is divided over this issue. Whilst some are great fans of Amendments 22 and 25, because they feel that these remove an imbalance, that the Arhus Convention is thus better implemented and that this is in line with the EC Treaty, others think the reverse, namely that these create inequality because environmental NGOs would be given a privileged position and that moreover, the Convention would be at least at loggerheads with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only regret that there is no room for a middle way, as a result of which NGOs would have the opportunity of having their say at times when it is really necessary, without there being the risk of numerous insignificant objections being lodged. In fact, I now believe that it would be preferable if the Convention were to simply give greater opportunities for access to justice, which is, in fact, what the late Constitutional Treaty would have done had it not now been abandoned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council’s common position does not, however, give the NGOs such access. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has therefore, quite correctly, supported the Commission’s original proposal and re-introduced this element. I regret that many members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are attempting to prevent the Århus Convention from being fairly implemented. Have they learned nothing from the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes? If we are to increase understanding of, and support for, the EU project, grass-roots participation and control are hugely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Take a current example. The European Parliament has decided to take proceedings against the Commission in the case of the brominated flame retardant BDE, on which the Commission has lifted the ban without having been given the right to do so by the legislator. Moreover, the Danish Government has followed suit by taking similar legal proceedings. The environmental organisations too need, however, to be able to take action when EU laws are broken. Now, the chemicals industry has been at its tricks again, keeping the citizens at bay. Individual citizens cannot have decisions in the environmental sphere tested because there is no individual interest. However, NGOs take care of public interests within the environmental and health spheres, so they should have access, in the EU too, to testing by the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here, of course, is a case of David and Goliath. The environmental organisations take care of public interests, while the chemicals industry, with huge sums of money behind it, can force decisions through the EU system. We saw this with REACH. Without transparency and grass-roots access to the Court of Justice, the EU is developing into an apology for a democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two points are of special importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is crucial that the decision be comprehensive in scope so that projects funded by the European Union are also covered by the regulations. The European Investment Bank too needs to be covered by the rules. Much criticism has been directed over the years at the EIB’s handling of environmental issues, its failure to take due account of the environment and its considerable lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want environmental organisations to be given a genuine right to take legal proceedings when the environmental rules are not observed. We are therefore opposed to any restriction on this right, for example that proposed by the rapporteur in Amendments 28 to 30. Such a restriction would in practice mean that many of the most important national environmental movements would not have the opportunity to take legal proceedings, and that is unacceptable to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We MEPs are dependent on receiving information from associations, organisations, non-governmental organisations and interested citizens, and reflect these in our legislative procedures. Only by incorporating the individual interests of the relevant groups in compromise legislative texts can we produce good legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, the public naturally needs access to information, something which – I should like to emphasise – is also extremely important, and there needs to be more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">It surprises me, of course, that the Commission occasionally sends information to NGOs and associations rather than to the Members of the European Parliament; I have discovered – for example, in connection with REACH – that many organisations and associations have been getting such information before it reaches our pigeonholes. That does not worry me, but what does worry me is the shape and form of the amendments to the present regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Stipulating that NGOs – which, incidentally, safeguard sectoral interests – may take legal action to see their views incorporated into legislative texts actually presupposes considerable mistrust in Parliament. As a rule, all European institutions seem to be regarded with general suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to allude to my previous occupation as a veterinary surgeon when I say that we are castrating ourselves and depriving ourselves of power here. We are calling ourselves into question and, in my opinion, we cannot allow this to happen. It would be a grave error to endorse this proposal; we should firmly oppose it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not implying that any NGO intends to exert a harmful influence on social developments, but I do request that it not be implied that Parliament is not up to its job.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly support the Council’s views on the second reading; everything else goes distinctly too far. That includes the proceedings for infringement of Community law, where intervention in ongoing proceedings is permitted: this does not benefit the public, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will quickly smooth out the problems of bureaucracy which have to date been the basic brake on all similar endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is most important that there should be a direct and intense response from the public sector to all aspects of the report and the proposed actions, because in numerous states the public sector is also the provider of most of the environmental information.

<p class="contents">This assumption needs to be taken further, however. Rules need to be established whereby the authorities are required to share environmental information with citizens, and they in turn must be able in extreme cases to demand that standards are enforced in the courts. We are talking about the implemented regulations of an environmentally-protective participatory democracy. In view of the fact that the European Union is drafting a White Paper with which it will endeavour to bridge the information gap separating it from its citizens, the content of the regulation under discussion is highly topical in the broader sense of relations with citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Århus Convention, in pursuit of an improved implementation of environmental protection legislation, the Commission envisaged certain non-governmental organisations having the right of access to the highest judicial instance, the European Court. The logical conclusion to be drawn with regard to this regulation is that non-governmental organisations play an important role in the protection of the environment. Yet the common position of the Council with regards to this area reveals a different interpretation of the Convention. It is based on fear of an improper use of the European Court, although this is not a logical interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">Half-measures in the efforts to implement environmental protection legislation and the removal of certain areas of work of the European institutions from democratic control would send the wrong political signal to Member States. It is possible that this would lead to a reduction rather than an increase in their responsibility in the implementation of environmental legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation before us has the objective of applying these rights against the EU institutions: Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the ECJ, the European Investment Bank, <span class="italic">et al</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that individuals who are directly affected by breaches of environmental law have a means of redress, whether through an appeal body, the Ombudsman or, if necessary, through the courts. This does not mean, however, drafting a lawyers’ charter, which is what we are in danger of doing.</p>
<p class="contents">While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups, which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watchdogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf, I would urge caution in allowing any self-legitimising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clog up an already overburdened justice system. While I am opposed to Amendments 2, 7 and 12, my biggest problem is with Amendment 26, which proposes that all NGOs, regardless of the legitimacy of their interests or the transparency of their constitutions, should be granted the right of unfettered instigation of court proceedings against Community institutions for their administrative acts or omissions, such as in enforcing the implementation of EU environmental law.</p>
<p class="contents">In some countries, an NGO can be formed with a membership of less than five people. Such a body is not democratically accountable by any definition, but these amendments would allow them to challenge the Commission without providing evidence of how or by whom they are funded or for what purpose. It is a long-established principle of EU law – built up over many years of case law and underpinned by Article 230(4) of the EC Treaty – that citizens need to have a direct and individual concern in order to have a standing in the ECJ. Bypassing the Treaty with secondary legislation such as the amendments to this regulation makes a mockery of the idea that it is the victim of infringements of the law rather than interested observers – whose motivation and support base may not always be clear – who should be able to seek a remedy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament wishes to extend the internal or judicial review process, it should do so through an amendment to the Treaty in the first instance. As a politician, democratically accountable to my electorate, I am also not prepared to delegate my responsibility to unelected, unaccountable bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way it helps to make our societies more environmentally conscious and encourages NGOs to be active in environmental policy. The most important part of the Convention is public participation in the decision-making process. Member States were not brave enough to accept the entire concept of the Convention. However, that is the way forward. We politicians will be judged by our voters on the state of the environment and on a sustainable future, and not on empty promises.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment along with other colleagues, which is the 23rd one on this matter. Some Members of this House oppose it. Nevertheless, the amendment is only a retabling of the Commission’s original words. It says that if an internal review concludes that there is a contradiction with environmental law, then the body concerned should take a decision to eliminate the problem. I think that is quite obvious. If we realise there is an environmental problem and we do not do anything about it, then the whole process is senseless. By the way, all Member States – and I mean all – signed the original Convention, which contains this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group is working in general, and in this particular case, for a clean environment and for public participation in the decision-making process. That is why we support this report in the form that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whatever some Members may claim, it is certainly not the intention to go beyond what is needed to enable the Community to be a party to the Århus Convention. I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has firmed up the Council’s common position. I am therefore completely behind the report and hope that it will be adopted in its entirety without the need for any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the increasing importance of Community environmental policy, the challenge for the regulation to comply with all provisions of the Århus Convention is significant, not least in terms of retaining some credibility in the eyes of the Member States and at international level. In other words, the same obligations and rights should exist at EU level as they do at Member State level. That certainly applies to the establishment of possible grounds for refusal of environmental information.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point of discussion has already been mentioned here, namely the transposal of the third pillar of the Convention, the one on access to justice. Clearly, the general interest of the environment cannot only be upheld by people who have a direct or personal interest, as the Convention provides. For that reason, the Commission wanted to restrict access to justice to environmental organisations that meet certain conditions. The wish to remove anything or add additional conditions is not only unacceptable but also contravenes the Århus Convention. I therefore sincerely hope that those Members who endorse open and transparent environmental policy in the EU will also approve the present report as it currently stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall make an appraisal of the basic amendments and, at the same time, reply to the main issues raised today.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as access to environmental information is concerned, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 14 or 15, which aim to apply the regime of exceptions to the provisions of the 2003-2004 directive to access to environmental information and requests for information addressed to Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation is being extended so that existing Community legislation on access to documents, as provided for in Regulation No 1049/2001, covers all Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific amendments by the European Parliament could bring about, as a corollary, the creation of two, partially overlapping regimes of access to documents, which would not help transparency and legal clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Article 6 of the common position already covers the exceptions in question and access to environmental information; these exceptions must be expressly clarified anyway in accordance with the requirements of the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7 and 12, which aim to include in the definition of environmental information the degree of progress of access procedures cannot be accepted. There is no such provision in the Århus Convention. Similarly, access procedures are not environmental information per se.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it should be noted that it is the Commission's practice to publish on its website information relating to access procedures for all policy sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendment 16 making provision for a deadline of 15 working days for persons applying for access to be informed, if the Community institution does not have the information requested, and to be referred to the public authority which appears to have the information in question.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as public participation is concerned, the Commission cannot accept its extension to policies, as called for in Amendment 5 and, partially, in Amendments 19 and 20. The Århus Convention encourages public participation in the preliminary preparation of policies within the framework of a best effort clause. This is a broad meaning and no such requirement is contained in the legislation addressed to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it should be noted that the practice applied today, at Community level, makes provision for public consultation with the interested parties during the drafting of Community policies. In addition, the definition of environmental plans and programmes is broad and covers programmes of a strategic nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept there is a need to call for public participation for plans and programmes funded by Community institutions, as provided for in Amendment 8. The Århus Convention refers to public participation for plans and programmes prepared by public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, permission for infrastructure works with a significant environmental impact is granted at the level of the Member State, where public participation is provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to accept in part Amendment 19, as regards the extension to the deadline for submitting comments within the framework of written consultations from 4 to 8 weeks. It can also accept Amendment 20 adding the obligation of the Community institution to take account of the results of public participation.</p>
<p class="contents">This specific obligation derives from the Århus Convention and corresponds to the Commission's current administrative practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 23 extending the circle of organisations with the right to request an internal review from non-governmental organisations with the basic objective of protecting the environment to those which also or alternatively promote sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This specific criterion would be very difficult to define and might cover a broad range of organisations for which there would be no justification in recognising, for environmental purposes, the right of access to such a review procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The recognition of a special regime for environmental non-governmental organisations, the basic object of which is to defend environmental interests, is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as regards the criteria for legalising non-governmental organisations, the Commission cannot accept the final amendment proposed by the rapporteur, namely that non-governmental organisations should develop activities in more than one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though it is true that the initial Commission proposal talked of activities at Community level, it became clear during discussions prior to the common position that such a decision would cause unjustified barriers to the right of access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is satisfied with the present provision in the common position, which talks of the Community dimension of the environmental objective which the non-governmental organisation should promote within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments 22, 24 and 25 refer to the outcome of the internal review of administrative acts adopted by the Community institutions in accordance with Article 10 and how they relate to the provisions on access to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 12.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons I have already mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the Commission cannot accept them because they would exceed provisions governing the legalisation of litigants under the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept in principle Amendments 26 and 27 concerning adaptation to the rules of procedure and the date of entry into force of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall send the European Parliament Secretariat a full list of the Commission's views on the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
