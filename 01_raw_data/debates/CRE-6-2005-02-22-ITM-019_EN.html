Training for seafarers is particularly important in terms of the prevention of maritime accidents. What we need are ways of enhancing the profession of Community seafarer by facilitating the free movement of seafarers within the EU and by promoting excellence and quality in their training.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before you responds to these two concerns by providing for recognition at EU level of seafarers’ certificates issued by any Member State. The goals pursued by the Commission with this directive are threefold. The first is that there be a prompt and efficient procedure for the recognition by Member States of seafarers’ certificates that are issued within the EU. The proposed system will put an end to the delays that are a feature of the current recognition system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second goal is to ensure compliance with Community requirements relating to training, certification and watchkeeping. The proposal provides for full and ongoing compliance with existing training and certification standards, and the Commission will regularly evaluate maritime training and certification systems in the Member States, with the assistance of the Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final goal relates to the fight against fraudulent practices associated with certification. Provision has been made for additional measures to prevent and combat fraudulent practices associated with the obtaining or issuing of certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Transport Council reached a broad understanding on the proposal in December 2004, and I am delighted that Parliament has made such a positive contribution on this matter. I am counting on the support of this House to ensure that this key text, which will facilitate the certification of seafarers from other EU Member States, is adopted without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for your attention. I hope that we will be able to send out a very clear signal to our fellow citizens that in the European Union the profession of seafarer continues to be particularly attractive, and that it is a profession that young Europeans should be proud to exercise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, my report amends the current legislation on the recognition of seafarers' certificates, making the legislation more appropriate and ironing out the anomalies that currently exist. I had a number of meetings about the report with the Commission, the Netherlands and Luxembourg presidencies, Parliament's Secretariat, the United Kingdom Government and my colleagues, and I am grateful to everyone for their contributions. I can confirm that the Council has given me an understanding, in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, that if we vote according to plan tomorrow, we can adopt this without further ado.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point of this legislation is safety. The safety and security of seafarers is important not just for those involved in the industry, but also for consumers, whether they are travellers on ships or buy the products of the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, the maritime industry is in general decline. Going to sea is no longer the attractive career that it might have been. The decline of the shipping and fishing industries means that wages are usually low and opportunities are few. Against this there will still always be a demand for travel by sea, both for industry and passengers. In spite of diminishing fish stocks in the waters, there will always be a demand for fish. Therefore the industry will always need workers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Mr Barrot has said, there is a shortage of workers at the moment. As countries and companies strive to balance supply and demand with regard to ship crews, the role of the European Union becomes more important. We need to provide for a common European system of freedom of movement. The current lack of availability of local staff means there is a vacuum which, as in other industries, will be filled by migrant labour. These workers need protection and standards that are equal to those enjoyed by existing workers.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is a timely measure, updating the existing European directive that dates from 2001. It aims to reduce the current administrative burden, combat discrimination and promote the mobility of workers in the maritime sector. European rules should, as far as possible, be in line with existing international agreements. In this case, the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers Convention gets rid of European red tape. This has been an important point and one that the trialogue has shared as a joint objective, which is how we have been able to reach this informal agreement before the debate. The training and certification requirements for seafarers are laid down by the International Maritime Organization, which also contains agreements on the recognition of certificates.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the system of recognition for certificates from third countries has been simplified, which leads to a rather unsatisfactory situation in which it is easier and simpler to get recognition for certificates from outside the European Union than it is to get recognition for certificates from within the European Union. This is discriminatory, restricts the free movement of seafarers and is an anomaly which needs to be removed, especially as we are dealing with a diminishing number of workers. I would like to stress, however, that the mere possession of a certificate of any sort does not in itself give a guarantee of employment, no more than a driving licence gives you the right to a job as a driver.</p>
<p class="contents">On language proficiency, which has been a thorny issue, we have agreed that a satisfactory command of language is necessary. In this case, English is the language involved. This will also apply to workers from third countries who might be affected by accidents if no provision for language proficiency was established.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention of fraud is a very important issue. All 25 Member States will be required to pursue their efforts in the context of the IMO towards the worldwide combating of fraud so as to ensure that safety standards are as high as possible. It is beholden on all of us to get our own fleets and regulatory processes in order, to ensure high standards throughout the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my report states that the Commission should prepare an evaluation report after five years. We heard in an earlier report of shipwrecks off the European coast, and the European Parliament has repeatedly put safety at the top of its agenda. We will be setting high standards on safety, high standards for workers and for certification. I am sure my colleagues will be able to support this report in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commission and the Commissioner for their dedication and commitment to combating fraud in relation to certificates issued to seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, in order to speed up this report, it was decided to bring together the Council and the Commission with a view to presenting an agreed draft. Both institutions have made interesting and enriching contributions and there was no great disagreement between the parties during the debate, and agreement prevailed at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">We can state that, following months of hard work, the proposal, which falls within the framework of the conventions of the International Maritime Organisation, will be one of the regulations that makes the greatest contribution to combating fraud in relation to certifications. As a result of my special relationship with the Balearic Islands, in Spain, I must express my personal satisfaction at the adoption of these measures, which will contribute to guaranteeing the safety and lives of seafarers, and also to protecting the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The islands require special attention in the field of maritime protection since they receive a large amount of merchant sea traffic. As a result of this experience — and this is why I am telling you about it — I know that the work of Mr Evans has not been insignificant. Amongst all of us, we have now increased the quality and quantity of work for our seafarers and, above all, we have safeguarded their reputation in society, which on occasions has been damaged by past cases of fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the comments made a short time ago by Mr López-Istúriz White are ample proof that the image of seafarers needs to be boosted in order to ensure that young people view this splendid profession as an attractive option.</p>
<p class="contents">It is paradoxical that the maritime industry is in decline even though enormous potential exists in Europe for transport by sea. It is therefore absolutely essential to improve training for seafarers, and to eliminate the existing shortcomings in order to attract enough young Europeans into these professions. As Mr Evans mentioned, free movement and the recognition of certificates will be additional tools to help us achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments further the Commission’s goals. As I just said, any measures that promote the free movement of seafarers, as well as any measures that make it possible to carry out strict checks on existing rules and to combat illegal practices associated with seafarers’ certificates, are steps in the right direction. The amendments seek to make the proposal clearer, whilst complying with the Council’s broad approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore tell you, Mr Evans, that the Commission accepts all of Parliament’s amendments. I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 32, however, which does away with the need to issue correlation tables listing the national measures implementing the directive, and adds a recital in its place. This position is in line with the approach taken by the Council, yet in view of my earlier comments I am sure that you will understand my misgivings. Although I am delighted that Parliament and the Council have decided to put forward similar texts in order to reach agreement at first reading, that does not mean that we should forget that correlation tables are needed for better lawmaking. As I said with regard to the previous text, Mr President, we must reach an interinstitutional agreement in order to implement this provision, as it will make it easier to apply anything that is decided by your Parliament, in agreement with the Council.
