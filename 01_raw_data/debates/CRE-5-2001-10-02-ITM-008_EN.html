We are the first to emphasise that this cooperation must be underpinned by a broad and comprehensive vision that includes not only issues in the field of justice and home affairs, but also the relationship between external policy, development policy and economic assistance policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of relations between the European Union and Morocco, we have identified three fundamental areas of debate: economic and social cooperation, the management of migratory flows and preventing and combating illegal immigration, including transit immigration from the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. An agreement on these three priorities will be concluded at the meeting scheduled for 9 October of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement Council. In order to implement practical actions we are intending to use the new budget line B-7-6-67, created in 2001, with a budget of EUR 10 million for 2001 which was, to a large extent, designed for practical actions of cooperation with Morocco<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The<span class="italic"> </span>issue of relations with Morocco must be considered in a broader context; that of the revitalisation of the Barcelona process. We acknowledge that only limited progress has been made on this process and we are fully aware that the international situation and our particular relationship with Morocco require the Barcelona process to be revitalised. This is also the stated intention of the forthcoming Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that, in order to revitalise the Barcelona process, it will be essential to adopt a regional programme in the field of justice and home affairs that will include issues of immigration, but which must also address other issues, such as, for example, improving the Rule of Law, good governance and cooperation in judicial matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is calculated that last year four or five thousand people drowned trying to cross the stretch which separates Morocco from Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to repeat the question, Commissioner, of whether there is any possibility that, without waiting for the result of the Barcelona process and the broader renegotiations on association, we can reach a very practical agreement in terms of policing and control so that the Moroccan authorities may prevent these deaths, which are reaching frightening proportions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something which is yet to reach a point which I consider acceptable.

<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to stress that in 2001 a very substantial proportion of the budgetary line which I mentioned has been dedicated to actions for cooperation with Morocco, increasing that country’s administrative capacity in the management of illegal immigration, which is not just a human problem: it is a political problem, especially for Spain. But it is also a problem for Morocco, because Morocco is today a transit country in which there are many sub-Saharan illegal immigrants, with very harmful social consequences for Morocco.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Release of Mr Albin Kurti and other Kosovars still being held hostage by the Belgrade authorities</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of some 2000 Kosovars who were kidnapped and held hostage by the military and paramilitary forces belonging to the regime then in place in Belgrade in the days leading up to the international police operation in Kosovo more than 28 months ago, 229 are still being held in Serb prisons. One hundred of them are being held for common law offences, while the remaining 129, including the student leader Arbin Kurti, are being held for their convictions or for 'political' offences. In February 2001 the Serb and Yugoslav parliaments passed an amnesty law allowing the release of 30 000 Serbs and some 400 Kosovars. At the end of April 2001, 143 prisoners were released from Jakova prison. The Serb judicial authorities had stated that the cases of the remaining Kosovar prisoners would be the subject of a rapid judicial review followed by release. Despite these commitments given by the Belgrade authorities, however, and despite the Council and Commission's repeated promises to intervene forcefully in order to put an end to this intolerable situation, the matter has still not been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue? If not, what initiatives will it take in order finally to bring about the immediate release of Arbin Kurti and the 129 Kosovar hostages and the transfer of the 100 Kosovar prisoners still being held in Serbia for common law offences to the UNMNIK, which is the only competent body in this connection? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, however, I should point out a certain number of things. On numerous occasions, your colleagues at the Commission have talked about priority with regard to the transferring of the Kosovar hostages from Serbia to Kosovo. They did so when the criminal Milosevic was still in power. That was almost a year ago, and there has been a change of regime in Belgrade, so it is even more incomprehensible that these problems have still not been solved.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about grounds for conviction, you talk about appeal procedures, but it has been established and confirmed, by this Parliament itself, that the Belgrade authorities were not competent, that only UNMIK was competent to deal with these cases, that the transfer had therefore already been accomplished, in law, and it was simply a matter of implementing it, and that has been the case for the past two years, Commissioner. Well, that is quite a long time for us, but I think it is an extremely long time for those who are still incarcerated in the gaols of Belgrade. In the case of Mr Arbin Kurti in particular, who was a student leader, I really do not understand what objections or other factors can still be preventing his transfer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, in reply to the Oral Question by Mr Alavanos, the letter of formal notice sent to Greece to which the honourable Member refers, concerns a recently initiated infringement procedure regarding the failure of Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to comply with Directive 89/48 in certain areas. On the other hand, the procedure referred to in question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2001-1336_EN.html">E-1336/01</a> earlier more specifically concerns problems surrounding the misapplication of Directive 89/48 to the psychology profession. The Commission considers that diplomas awarded in Greece by another Member State and the refranchising agreements do not relate to training provided from or by Greece, but to training provided from or by the other Member State, since the Greek establishment in which the training in question has been provided is merely an intermediary without any autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, it is not the Greek establishment that awards diplomas, but rather the university in the other Member State, and consequently, if those diplomas relate to professional training within the meaning of Directive 89/48, they are covered by that Directive. The purpose of the letter of formal notice is to obtain the Member State's observations on specific questions. Greece has not yet replied to that letter of formal notice and, therefore, no firm grounds for infringement procedings have been established as yet. Consequently, the Commission is not able to reply to that part of the question from the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the similarity of the subject matter, I shall now continue, if I may, by answering the question by Mr Hatzidakis. In the judgment to which the honourable Member refers, the Court of Justice of the European Communities condemned Greece for its failure to communicate measures taken to implement Directive 89/48 – the Directive I referred to in my reply to the previous question. The Commission thus initiated a new infringement procedure against Greece with a request for the fixing of penalty payments. This second procedure was closed when Greece complied.</p>
<p class="contents">It complied with the Court's judgment by forwarding Presidential Decree No 165 of 23 June 2000 to the Commission. As I pointed out in my reply to the previous Oral Question put by Mr Alavanos, the Commission considers that certain provisions of Directive 89/48 have not been implemented correctly. The Commission has also received complaints from individuals who, even since the implementation of the directive, have not seen their rights respected. The Commission has, therefore, initiated a new infringement procedure, this time for incorrect implementation and application of the directive, and the letter of formal notice to which I referred just now has been sent to Greece. We expect to receive the observations of the Greek authorities very soon. A specific procedure for recognition of the psychology profession is currently being introduced, and that profession, together with a number of others, has been the subject of specific implementing legislation on problems concerning the application of Directive 89/48 that have also been drawn to the Commission's attention in that context. That is my reply to the question put by Mr Hatzidakis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All that remains to be seen is what the government's response will be to the Commission's move.

<p class="contents">However, my question to the Commissioner is this: why confine ourselves solely to the psychology profession and, more to the point, to psychologists who have graduated from French universities when numerous complaints have been lodged with the Commission by other disciplines and by students studying in other faculties and graduating from foreign universities, even though they have taken part of their course in Greece? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The basic issue is the question of whether a degree awarded by another Member State, following a course of studies which takes place physically in Greece, is or is not assimilated to a similar degree issued in Greece itself following studies at a Greek university. So it is the equivalence between a purely Greek degree and a degree awarded by a university of another Member State, but where the study has been undertaken at a Greek establishment. That assimilation, that equality is the purpose of Directive 89/48, to which I have referred at various times this afternoon. The Commission is taking that into consideration and has asked Greece to explain why that directive has not been transposed and applied accordingly. The directive does not confine itself to psychologists and, to that extent, I can assure Mr Alavanos that his fears are unfounded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1998 the Commission asked Finland to amend its system of car and motorcycle taxation. Commission officials have admitted that Finland has in fact failed to remove the discrimination to any significant degree. Most recently, in September 2001, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions received a petition signed by me and 17 000 of my compatriots, demanding an overhaul of the illegal tax regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland has been an EU Member since 1995; when will the Commission take action to force it to toe the line and start implementing single market rules as interpreted by the European Court of Justice?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission take independent legal action, because waiting for new rulings by the Court of Justice will hardly bring any additional clarity especially after the recent ruling on Portugal (C-393/98)?</p>
<p class="contents">The tax on removal vehicles also hinders people’s freedom to move within the Community. Will the Commission see to it that this illegality is remedied in the near future? </p>

The Commission is currently considering initiating a procedure against Finland under Article 226 of the Treaty, which will supplement the one initiated in 1998. This case will be dealt with at a Commission meeting in the near future. The new procedure is also likely to cover problems in implementing Directive 83/183, which deals with the tax exemptions granted when people move house. At the same time, Commission staff have written to all Member States, drawing their attention to the judgment by the Court of Justice to which Mr Vatanen’s question refers, namely the Gomez-Valente Judgment of 22 February 2001, and the Commission shares the honourable Member’s opinion that the judgment in question will have implications outside the context of the dispute in question, and will open up the way to second-hand vehicles being treated in a manner which is more in line with the requirements of the European internal market. However, the Commission wishes to point out that the procedure intended to ensure that the above-mentioned judgment is complied with must remain independent of any other procedure which it has initiated or is intending to initiate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One complicating factor is that this is an area which has not yet been harmonised in the European Union. The Commission's legal basis for its actions is Article 90 of the Treaty on the one hand, which prohibits tax discrimination, and on the other hand two directives adopted in 1983. Article 90 gives the Court of Justice the opportunity for abundant jurisprudence. Since interpretations of the judgments of the Court are not always unanimous, it is time to create a synthesis of all the various interpretations in order to determine clearly our future action.</p>
<p class="contents">That need for a synthesis is one of the reasons that led me to include in the Commission's working programme for this year a communication on motor vehicle taxation. It is my intention that this communication, which I hope will appear around the end of this year or the beginning of next year, will cover all the problems in connection with vehicle taxation and vehicle pricing, so that we can take a broader approach to them and settle the problem in Finland to which Mr Vatanen has referred.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Law on the use of minority languages in Slovakia</span></p>
<p class="contents">From an official position paper of the Foreign Ministry of the Slovak Republic, sent to us by the Slovak ambassador in Brussels, we understand that the law of 1999 on the use of minority languages in Slovakia gives minorities certain rights. When 20% or more of the inhabitants of a village speak another language, they can receive official communications in their own language. We have personal experience of how this law operates in practice. In villages where more than 20% of the population is made up Slovaks, the inhabitants can receive all official communications in Slovakian. The law thus appears to work satisfactorily. However, when it transpires that in the same village 75% of the population is Hungarian and they can obtain official documents concerning births, marriages and deaths only in Slovakian and the mayor of the village may not speak Hungarian during public or official functions, then we must have serious doubts about the implementation of a language law which appears satisfactory on paper.</p>

It takes the view that Slovakia has made considerable progress in developing a positive policy on minorities and in drawing up the necessary legislation whilst putting in place and supporting the relevant institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The enacting of the law on the use of minority languages for official business was, in this regard, an important step. It brought domestic law into line with current international standards and complied with the specific recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important step was the ratification of the European Charter on regional or minority languages. It should be noted in particular that Slovakia desires to concede the greatest possible freedom to the Hungarian minority in accordance with the flexibility that the Charter makes possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission nevertheless observes that considerable efforts are still required for the practical enforcement of all the existing legislation. In some areas, minorities do not avail themselves of the rights guaranteed them by the law on the use of minority languages for official business, above all, it seems, through ignorance of them. This seems to be the case above all in communities with a large proportion of Roma among the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue in future to urge Slovakia to continue its efforts to implement the provisions of its laws, improve policy in this area and make the necessary budget funds available. The observations which you, Mrs Maes, have made in person come as no surprise to me. They prove only that the difficulties with implementation, which I have described, continue to prevail. We will be discussing this topic further in the next progress report on Slovakia, which is due to appear in November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lithuanian Parliament adopted a national energy strategy in 1999. As part of this, it has decided that Block 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is to be decommissioned by 2005 and that the final decision on the decommissioning date for Block 2 will be taken in 2004 in the context of the national energy strategy review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stated at the time that it understood that Block 2 had to be shut down by 2009. This is a matter of logic: if 2005 is the latest date for Block 1 to be shut down, it follows from the envisaged lifetime of the two nuclear power installation units that 2009 is the latest date for the decommissioning of Block 2.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Block 1, the Commission took it into account that Lithuania had commenced extensive preparations for decommissioning and shutting down. I am working on the assumption that the decommissioning is actually to take place before 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Block 2 is concerned, the Commission has stated – as I have already said – that the decommissioning is to take place by 2009 at the latest. Over and above that, the Commission and the Member States believe that the timetable for the decision on decommissioning should be compatible with the timetable for Lithuania's accession to the European Union. I spoke about this in depth only a few days ago with the new Lithuanian government in Vilna – it was actually the main topic of conversation in Vilnius – and I got the impression that the Lithuanian parliament and government had well understood the message that they now have to think about how the timetable for the decisions about Ignalina Block 2 has to be revised with a view to their own timetable for joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to point out that it is precisely with regard to Ignalina that the Commission views compromises as impossible. Ignalina is a nuclear power plant of the same type as Chernobyl, one that experts are generally convinced is not retrofittable and cannot be brought up to acceptable safety standards. It is our firm conviction that this Chernobyl-type nuclear power plant is a source of real danger to human beings, and we will therefore be unable to withdraw our demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union's stance on this issue will not change.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation as regards the second question is as follows: an international fund for the decommissioning of Block 1 of the plant was created. The fund is managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and, to date, EUR 220 million have been made available for it. These EUR 220 million I mentioned were the result of an international conference of donors which I convened jointly with the Lithuanian Prime Minister last year in Vilnius. I must however add – and this clouds the picture a little – that EUR 165 million of this sum comes from our own budget, so that the amount that the international community was prepared to raise in addition looks modest in comparison. Nonetheless, the funds available suffice to start on the shutting-down process as planned and to finance all the tasks connected with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must draw it to your attention that the shutdown of such a nuclear power plant is a project lasting decades and the financial obligations resulting from it for us will last for the same period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation with regard to the plant's Block II is rather more complicated because the Lithuanian parliament has not to date fixed a definite date for it to be shut down. During the discussions I have mentioned, I have however informed the Lithuanian government that the Commission is of course prepared to provide the necessary help in this aspect too, and is moreover willing to organise international aid. A country like Lithuania can quite clearly not manage the huge task of shutting down a power plant like this one by its own resources alone. It would, by the way, also be quite unfair to demand that of them, for it was not Lithuania that wanted the plant. On the contrary, the Lithuanians even resisted it at the time. It was the former Soviet Union that built this plant on the spot where it stands today, and certainly not in order to provide Lithuania with electricity, but, in the main – we believe – for military purposes. It is, then, part of the legacy of the former Soviet Union, burdening a poor country like Lithuania. It is in our interest that this legacy should disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no EU norms for the safety of reactors, which I myself greatly regret, but it has not to date been possible to change this situation. The Council has worked intensively on this issue, precisely because the Commission has no competence in reactor safety issues. The Council's working party on nuclear issues has applied itself to the safety situation in Eastern European nuclear power plants and presented a report just before the summer recess, which is no doubt available to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that you study this report, which does not of course state that we have laid down European norms, but from which it is clear that the European Union, as regards the safety of Eastern European nuclear power installations, makes demands that it believes to be justified. A list of nuclear power stations, such as you have proposed, resulted from investigations carried out much earlier, at the beginning of the nineties to be precise. These installations, which in the view of the European Union are not capable of a retrofit – that is, they cannot be made safe – are situated in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. We have, as you know, made it a condition for the commencement of accession negotiations that the issue of the shutting-down of these nuclear power stations should be finalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quote is directly from him. It is not an internal matter, it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly, privately, that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again, the Czech Republic's EU entry chances would be harmed. The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards, and I quote directly from what he said, 'I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly, nevertheless they have not been embargoed.'</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, do you deny that you made such a statement? Also, on matters exclusively for the Czech people – electing their leader, what stance they should take with regard to negotiations with their accession to the European Union, and particularly at a time when confidence building is required both within the EU and within the accession countries – do you think it is right that you as an official and a Member of the College of Commissioners should be interfering with the democratic wishes of the Czech people, or indeed the people of any country?</p>
<p class="contents">We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs, but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold.

If you want to change that, then that's up to you. I will neither confirm nor deny anything in this matter. Stony silence is the only way the Commission can avoid being involved in internal political disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, however, quite gladly say something about the actual substance of your question. The president of the Czech parliament and I have for many years been able to talk intimately and in confidence with one another. The most recent, and, I might add, entirely private, in-depth conversation took place only a few days ago. The president of the Czech parliament did not mention in this conversation the event that you have taken as the basis for your question. But it means much to me that Mr Klaus, in the many, many conversations we have had, has always made it clear that he, himself, and his political friends desire and support the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union. That he occasionally expresses other views, views differing from those shared by the majority in Europe, is well known, but he is quite entitled to do so, and we, as democrats, must accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point must be that it goes without saying that the European Union has the right to tell candidate countries what it accepts and what it does not; to point out that certain criteria are required to be met for accession negotiations to begin and to be concluded, and that the most important of them is the political criterion according to which a country must guarantee that it is a democracy under the rule of law, respecting human rights, protecting minorities and sharing the values and objectives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come about that a country seeking membership has been told, on the basis of this assessment: ‘We cannot start negotiating with you about accession, because you do not meet these political requirements.’ The question you have asked, whether political intervention of this sort occurs, must therefore be answered very clearly in the affirmative. It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter does not come within our competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of assessing whether the safety level is sufficient falls to the operators and the national authorities, in accordance with their competences in France. On that basis, it is for them to decide whether all the safety conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Commission, tests should be carried out in October to check that the security elements are operating correctly, such as the ventilation system or the electronic control centre, and the degree of training of the staff in charge of operation and emergency services. In this respect, one of the main measures to be implemented relates to the distance between vehicles when using the tunnel. Furthermore, this measure will contribute to restricting the circulation of lorries via that route.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to organisational aspects, an important element is the creation by the two original companies, the French ATMB and the Italian SITMB, of a single company to take charge of managing the tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sustainable mobility and the great number of operators who are impatiently awaiting the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, given the serious disruption caused by its closure and the saturation of the routes which have been used as diversions, it should be pointed out that, in the short term, the reopening of the tunnel is going to be very positive from the point of view of sustainable mobility, the environment and safety. I insist, however, that the safety measures must be in place as a prior condition for its reopening.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, the absolute priority is to maintain control of the flow of land transport in the Alpine region, without hindering freedom of movement and economic development and, specifically, access from the Italian Peninsula to the rest of Europe will be based on the elements which I mentioned a moment ago, that is, by providing the Alps with major rail crossings which will carry a large proportion of the rail transport burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what I can tell you in relation to safety regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I must insist, however, that Italy and France are the competent administrations. And no doubt within Italy and France, in accordance with their internal institutional organisation, there are probably certain other regional or local administrations which also have a role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would like to say to the Member that the Community’s fundamental freedoms are the freedom of movement of goods and of persons. We must guarantee the interconnection between Italy and the rest of the European continent; which clearly means a better distribution of traffic between the Alpine crossings and between the various modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, thanks to the agreement with Switzerland, there are other types of possible access for North-south traffic and for traffic between Italy and the rest of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mont Blanc tunnel is one of the elements, but it is not the only one, and the traffic which has been diverted from the Mont Blanc tunnel is undoubtedly causing an overload in other areas – and I could mention other tunnels which you know even better than me. In any event, the important thing is to carry out the work on the Lyon-Turin route and the Brenner tunnel, which are key and definitive elements, but which are going to take some time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that objective will clearly not be achieved through a statement of will and an approval by the Commission, but it must be approved by this House and by the Council of Ministers and then put into practice. It will be efforts of all types over a number of years which will allow us to make progress. But we must consider that transport sometimes resolves problems created by other types of decisions. Decisions which relate to urban policy, to development policy, to forms of production, to a series of policies on territorial balance and other things, where transport simply offers facilities at a certain moment, resolves problems and makes its contribution.

<p class="contents">Considerable work has been done by means of a series of Commission studies and the Fourth and Fifth Framework Research Programmes, which have examined transport expenses in the Alpine regions and other regions, including the project relating to the information systems on Alpine transport and the European strategic multimodal model and the Alp-net project which is currently under way. The problem was also dealt with in the reports of the high-level group, which Parliament approved by means of its resolution, contained in the Costa report on charging for the use of infrastructures, which I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission White Paper on common policy not only offers current estimates of the costs of road transport, but also treats as a priority the resolution of the transport problems in the Alpine regions by means of a wide range of measures which I referred to earlier. In that context, we are studying the possibility of creating a system for testing charging in sensitive mountain regions such as the Alps as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Those initiatives should not only have a possible effect on the current volume of traffic, but above all promote the use of less polluting vehicles and thereby contribute to reducing the negative effects of traffic, both on human health and on the flora and fauna of the regions in question and also allow for cross-subsidisation, which I also referred to a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as I have said repeatedly, we believe that the modal rebalancing of transport in Europe is a key element not only for the quality of life of our citizens, for the protection of the environment, but also for economic development because, without that modal rebalancing, we will face a situation of gridlock of our road networks and our transport routes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It promotes the feeling of victimisation in people who already have the sense that they are victims. I do not feel happy about the entire Conference in Durban, irrespective of the way in which the Middle East was presented there. The fact that someone like Castro was cheered, is proof that this was an anti-Western meeting’. These are not my words but the words of a Member of the European Commission. In a moment, we will be listening to a statement by the European Commission and by the Council on Durban. I would invite the Commission to tell us whether it backs the statements by Mr Bolkestein in the <span class="italic">Volkskrant</span> in the Netherlands or not, as the case may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
