<p class="contents">The first exercise led to the release of country-specific recommendations adopted by the Commission in June, and had the aim of providing ex-ante guidance to Member States in both fiscal and structural objectives. These recommendations were endorsed by the Council in July following the introduction of changes. As part of Parliament’s role of ensuring maximum transparency and accountability at the Union level, the European Parliament is eager to foster a debate on these recommendations, as well as more generally on the outcome of the first instalment of the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">These oral questions to the Commission and Council seek to review the Semester with the aim of improving it. Do the Council and the Commission believe the Semester lived up to expectations, and if the exercise was not perfect, how do they think it should be improved next year? Does the Council consider that the changes it made to the recommendations in June and July of this year were made in a sufficiently transparent manner? It looks a little like the old habit of the Council weakening draft recommendations by the Commission, about which we are justifiably nervous.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Council has the right to alter those recommendations, but it is also in line with Parliament’s new role as guarantor of EU-level transparency and accountability to seek answers to the questions as to why certain changes were made. The committee is planning to organise a more detailed hearing on exactly that question on 7 November, to which both the Commission and the Council have been invited.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is also asking about the interaction between tools of different legal natures – for example, the national reform programmes, which are non-binding, and the stability and convergence programmes, which are binding – and is seeking an assessment of Member States’ commitment to and ownership of the European Semester. All of this is crucial to implement the significantly enhanced economic governance that Europe needs as a result of the ongoing crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When the Commission took the initiative to present this European Semester proposal, the idea was that economic governance should include a period of time for establishing European guidelines. This is, to some extent, a step towards the creation of this infamous economic government. We, the European Parliament, are worried about the fact that there might be an economic government without an economic ‘parliament’.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to hear your assessment of the democratic legitimacy of this European Semester. How does democratic debate on this European Semester fit in?</p>
<p class="contents">Political debate on economic policy guidelines is the foundation of every democracy. If you raise the level at which economic policy guidelines are decided, then you must pay heed to the democratic debate and deliberation on those guidelines. That is what the European Parliament is trying to ensure and what we are challenging you on.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that, during the European Council on Sunday, you brought up the European Semester and you managed to do so without once mentioning the European Parliament, or even, I have to say, the national parliaments. Do you think that that is acceptable?</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission pledged to present its next Annual Growth Survey in December. Very well. So be it. Why, then, have you not discussed it with us? Where is the democratic debate on this issue? When you table your new proposal, which assessment of the cycle that has just ended will you base it on? How are you incorporating the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in your analysis of this European Semester? Furthermore, as Ms Bowles said – and I fully support her on this and on many other points in this matter – we are asking you to be completely transparent with regard to the amendments that you make to the country-specific recommendations after discussing them with the Member States. Otherwise, this exercise has no legitimacy and is meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">When you adopt the Annual Growth Survey, how much importance do you really attach to that document? Is it just a bureaucratic document to keep the European Parliament happy, or is it a genuine policy document? Unless we are mistaken, and your real objective is the Euro Plus Pact. We want some explanations on this point, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is the first time we could be tempted – at least initially – to evaluate the operation of the European Semester and draw at least a few possible conclusions at this stage as to its implementation in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that we can, in fact, only provide an initial assessment, as the Semester itself and the whole process have not yet ended. This process, or at least its annual function, will only end when the national parliaments have approved their national budgets. This will be our first opportunity actually to assess whether the whole procedure, which began in January 2011, has had any positive results, whether there is any added value in national budgets compared to the situation previously, whether there has been greater synergy between the economic policies of the Member States as we had all hoped, and whether there has been a greater concentration of resources in accordance with the main priorities of the European Union. This is something which as yet we do not know. This process is still ongoing, so only in a few months’ time will we be able to assess how effective this European Semester has been. However, based on our initial experience, it seems that this process is the right one, one that is required, and one which has been taken very seriously both by the Member States and the national parliaments, as well as by all European Union institutions involved in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would briefly like to remind you how this process works. It begins, at the moment at least, in January when the European Commission presents its annual analysis of economic growth. Based on this, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council adopts certain guidelines for Member States in February. Then the Member States have until April to prepare national reform programmes, stability and growth pacts or convergence programmes, depending on whether they are members of the euro area. Then there follows a period when the European Commission prepares recommendations with the participation of the Member States, and responds to comments submitted by the Member States. There follows a very busy period in June, when both the relevant sector councils, their groups and preparatory bodies, as well as the European Council, finally approve the guidelines, which are ultimately – as was the case here – approved by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 12 July. At this time, the deadlines are very tight. We now have some conclusions and some suggestions for the future on how to streamline the process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we should be assessing the European Semester from two different points of view, the first aspect being the technical functioning of the European Semester which I have just discussed, when certain documents are approved and there is a timetable to be followed. The second aspect is the influence of the European Semester on macro-economic dialogue in the European Union and the engagement of Member States in that dialogue, its influence on the macro-economic situation and on public finances. This is actually the main element of the European Semester, the linking of macro-economic priorities with the possibilities and priorities of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the technical aspect, after the initial process of preparing recommendations for Member States, which took several months, it is clear that this is a very technical process which requires a great deal of work on documentation all through the process. During the first six months, over 600 documents are drafted. Please remember that the majority of these documents must then be translated into all the national languages within a set time. Logistically, this is therefore a very complicated process. Then, in June, we have a very busy diary and very short deadlines for all the appropriate bodies to give their opinions and approve the relevant documents. There is not much room for manoeuvre, as the Council’s diary is so full that not much can be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the question arises as to how this could be improved. One suggestion which, at the moment, is becoming increasingly clear – and I hope this will be finally agreed – is to start the whole process a little earlier. There is a proposal for the European Commission to present its annual report in December, which would give the Member States and EU bodies several weeks to prepare for the beginning of the dialogue. In this case, in April we would already be much further along the line of discussing and agreeing the Member States’ responses to the priorities indicated in the Commission’s annual report, and our preparations regarding reform programme documents and stability and growth pacts would be more advanced and better discussed. This would probably help to alleviate the pressure at the end of May and in June – the pressure to ensure that all the EU bodies are working effectively and can approve all the documents efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out how determined the Member States have been to implement the process effectively this year. As I have said, there are many documents – over 600. There are very short deadlines for comments. As a result, Member States accepted certain departures from the current rules. In cases where there was a large volume of documents, the process was expedited even if not all the language versions were available. This is very difficult for many Member States to accept, but they did agree to it, thus confirming their commitment to the process. They were prepared to work with the English or French versions available at the time in order to expedite the work, so that the dialogue could continue and all the recommendations could be approved in the time available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to the second element, which is much more important to us: the assessment of the influence of the whole European Semester procedure on macro-economic dialogue in the European Union. We must remember that the European Semester is only one of several factors which have emerged in recent months in the European Union as new instruments for greater economic cooperation between Member States and for improving the implementation of EU priorities in this area. We have the European Semester and the ‘six-pack’, which has only just been adopted, and we also have normal implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. All these elements form a whole and also bring greater transparency to the procedure as well as a much stronger dialogue between Member States and much greater transparency in relation to the actual economic situation in each Member State. They also enable greater pressure to be exerted mutually on Member States, so that the discussion on macro-economic priorities can proceed in the right direction and so that everyone is fully aware of the direction the EU is going in and what challenges are being faced by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the ‘six-pack’ has, in practice, fostered greater involvement of the national parliaments in the process of incorporating EU macro-economic developmental priorities into national policies through the strongest instrument existing in each country – the national budget. The national parliaments are informed, during the initial stage of discussion, which priorities each Member State intends to put forward in its national reform programme and approximately which budgetary approach will be adopted by each Member State, as the information in both documents submitted to the European Commission is given to them. Secondly, they know the results of the European Council’s recommendations. They know what the EU has recommended in this area. Later, the national parliaments have the final say on the form the national budget should take, so they have a very good instrument which monitors the way in which national governments incorporate EU priority recommendations into national measures. It is important that the European Semester should shape the direction taken by EU measures, providing one specific direction that Member States should follow. If the priority turns out to be one of maintaining or increasing growth in some Member States or implementation of the Europe 2020 agenda, this clearly shows and points to where the EU should proceed, at the same time providing flexibility for individual Member States, as we are not all starting from the same place, but we do all have to go in the same direction. This is very important. There is not a single gold standard with which everyone should comply, irrespective of whether they need it or not. We hold individual discussions regarding Member States and their economic situation, we give them a clear signal in which direction they should proceed, but we also give them a great deal of freedom in choosing the methods they need to attain their objective.</p>
<p class="contents">A second element which is becoming increasingly important is greater coordination and better targeting of EU resources for the implementation of EU priorities. National reform programmes which specify how a particular country would like to spend at least the majority of funding received from the EU are linked into the whole process. Through coordination of this document with others relating to the management of the public finances of a particular Member State, as well as with EU priorities, and by adapting them all further down the line, we give a clear signal that the EU has chosen these priorities and is ready to fund them and that we would also like – in the view of the EU – that Member State to subordinate its expenditure priorities in its national budget to these targets. Then we will have achieved the target designated for all EU Member States. This message is now very clear. I think that in this area – in the opinion of the Council – the European Semester has, for the time being, fulfilled its role very well.</p>
<p class="contents">How will this finally affect national budgets? This we do not know, as it depends on decisions made in national parliaments. However, the instruments are in place, the possibilities are there, and they should be used. However, it may happen that our final assessment for this year will continue to raise many questions and indications that something could have been done better. We must, however, remember that the European Semester was introduced at a rather bad time. We have a huge debt crisis in the EU and we have quite significant problems with the banking sector. In fact, the economic situation of the EU is very volatile. What we saw as priorities in April or May – as targets which could be achieved within that set of economic realities, the realities of the spring of this year – may be insufficient or impossible to achieve at the present moment. As a result, in a few weeks’ time, it will be easy to criticise the fact that despite the European Semester, Member States have not achieved certain things. However, the dynamics of economic change in the EU and the development of the crisis are so great that it really is difficult at the moment to foresee all the right measures which should be taken one year into the future. We should remember that all these instruments – the European Semester, the ‘six-pack’ – are there to help us bring stability to the macro-economic situation in the EU and give direction to what we do. However, they are not instruments which will solve the crisis in two or three weeks. These instruments were never planned as such, so we cannot expect implementation of the European Semester to improve the economic situation in the EU immediately. However, we believe that as a result of the European Semester, macro-economic dialogue will improve markedly in the EU, and this is its fundamental aim.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Council’s assessment of how the process is progressing is positive. We have learned some lessons – more from the technical point of view – about how to improve the process and give Member States more opportunity to implement the process well, and about how to participate fully and achieve better dialogue with the Commission concerning the recommendations made. Questions have been asked here as to where the European Parliament is in all this and whether this is a transparent process. The answer is yes, it is. All the documents are available on the Internet and are in the public domain. Everyone can take part in the process. In accordance with the new procedures, the European Parliament can also invite representatives of the European Council and the Council to participate in discussions, taking into account the macro-economic situation. That is why I think that everything is moving in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with you our assessment of this first European Semester and also our plans for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European Semester has been an important step in strengthening our economic governance. It is part of an effort to rebuild confidence through a clear focus on building the foundations for employment and growth and through stronger policy design and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We had clear expectations of what a European Semester should mainly achieve in substance. Firstly, we wanted to ensure a closer integration of the policy analysis and guidance across fiscal and macro-economic policies, but also of the policy formulation in Member States. Secondly, we wanted to ensure that the policy guidance given to Member States has a stronger effect on implementation, through a better ex-ante timing of policy guidance and through clearer and more concrete country-specific recommendations. At the same time, the European Semester was supposed to ensure that the EU-level dimension in terms of policy spillovers was taken into account from the start when formulating policies at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Against these expectations, the first European Semester has been successful. We have made significant progress on these key elements. When it comes to assessing the effectiveness of ex-ante policy guidance in terms of the follow-up by Member States, it is a bit too early to tell: we are, after all, only part way through the ‘national semester’. A measurable answer will therefore only be possible when Member States’ budgets and structural reforms have been decided and we have assessed them. I count on this House to play a full part in making this assessment. We will then have to follow up on the implementation and examine what is the impact of the measures taken.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear recognition on the part of most stakeholders that the policy guidance has become more integrated across policy areas and is more focused on countries’ central priorities. It has also been clearer and more concrete, which should facilitate implementation. With the joint presentation of their SCPs and NRPs, Member States have set out their views on how the key policy challenges should be addressed. The Commission has assessed these policy plans and proposed integrated recommendations based on the broad economic and employment policy guidelines and on the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of legal instruments. The Annual Growth Survey has set the horizontal policy priorities for Member States and ensured that national programmes take account of the EU dimension from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">While I consider the European Semester a clear success and an important step forward, there is naturally also scope for improvement. In 2012, the most important aspect is certainly going to be a stronger focus on the growth dimension. As President Barroso outlined here on 12 October, bolstering growth, through full implementation of key reforms on the single market, but also through new and innovative financing instruments such as project bonds, is a central dimension of putting Europe on the course out of the crisis. You will certainly see EU-level action on growth and employment at the heart of the next Annual Growth Survey. The Commission has also decided to advance the presentation of the Annual Growth Survey to late 2011. This should allow for a fuller debate from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">In our democratic societies, reform efforts can only be sustained if they have legitimacy, both in terms of being anchored in the democratic process and carried by the elected representatives of the European citizens as well as in terms of delivering what serves the common good. This means, of course, that this House, as well as national parliaments, will have to play an important role in the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong link between the EU dimension and the national dimensions of key policy challenges can only be established if these perspectives are brought together through true ownership. This can only be achieved if parliaments have a strong role. I believe that the spring interparliamentary meeting which you organised in 2011 could, if repeated, become an important institutional way of better involving national parliaments to ensure legitimacy. And, of course, the new economic governance legislation underlines the need for national parliaments – and other stakeholders – to be fully involved in the Semester, and in the elaboration of the SCPs and NRPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only be pleased about that. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, this tool, as it is called, needs to help move the situation forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address, in particular, the Council representative. It took you 16 minutes to explain the mechanism, which we were familiar with, and to tell us that all this is very technical, that it is ultimately too much for one to understand and that, if Parliament wants to be informed, then it is in luck, because it can consult the documents that are updated for the general public online.</p>
<p class="contents">You might also tell us to read the newspapers, which we do as a matter of course. I find it quite shocking that the only response to the question that was asked about Parliament’s role in the European Semester was that we should read the newspapers and search the Internet and we will learn just as much about it. You know, when we meet our fellow citizens – and I wonder whether you ever have cause to meet them yourself – they ask us: ‘What is Europe doing with regard to these issues?’ Until now, we would tell them: ‘Ah, we have developed the European Semester!’ Well today, the European Semester is a damp squib.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wished to say to you, Mr Dominik. The method that has been applied excessively for some months now is certainly not one that will enable Europe to overcome the crisis.</p>

<p class="contents">However, if we are to be able to make the necessary structural moves in time, we need to learn a number of initial first lessons from this procedure. During the first application of the European Semester, we had a text on substantive divergence on the part of the Member States from growth targets based on the EU 2020 strategy of rather restricted orientation and failure to comply with certain recommendations made by the Commission for each of the Member States at the Council’s initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As delays, failure to apply decisions on time and, most importantly, the lack of cohesion between the various Union policies seem to be developing – as other speakers have said – into a fundamental problem for the Union in the present crisis, we want to insist on this point. We insist that, within the framework of the European Semester, we need a substantive and weighty proposal for viability and growth and the full application of the Community procedure, with the European Parliament involved at all stages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I ask you, Mr Dominik, what planet are you on? As for you, Commissioner, your speech certainly showed that you are slightly more aware of the need for democratic legitimacy in economic decision making, but do you talk to people who are currently in turmoil? Do you see what state the euro area is in and how we are perceived throughout the world? A little more self-criticism would not go amiss, if you ask me.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Semester is a useful initiative that has got off to a good start but which is nowhere near enough. I should like to emphasise one point: to be perfectly honest, it is an insult to this Parliament to tell us to go and look on a website so that we can participate in the decision-making process. It is an insult to democracy. We are not asking you to give us your information as an act of charity. We are asking to be involved in making economic, social and fiscal decisions that are going to be absolutely crucial if we want the euro area, on the one hand, and the EU 27, on the other, to be able to function slightly better – to put it mildly – than in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">We need debates beyond borders. We need the national parliaments to mobilise. We need a general mobilisation and a bit more than information and communication. We need a comprehensive European public debate, and this Parliament really must be one of the forums for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is simply because the Council lives in the real world, politically and economically speaking. A Council representative has finally said it here. He understands that there is not just a European Parliament, but there are also national parliaments, and the debate in the national parliaments is not a simple matter and is not one-way. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council communicated an obvious truth here between the lines, that the development of national economies is heterogeneous and cannot be harmonised overnight. Thirdly, the Council has declared that the process is very complicated. If the Council says that there are 600 documents that are not even in the official languages, and the national parliaments must somehow grapple with this, it will naturally take some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the point I regard as being the most serious. The static set objectives from six months ago are fundamentally out of step with today's turbulent economic developments. I am satisfied with the Council’s response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have my doubts, however. In all the recommendations that have been made to the Member States, there is a major common factor, which is that they have only looked at government expenditure, which needs to be cleaned up as much as possible. That is the dominant theme in the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Dalli says that the Commission will take a broader approach next time, which will encompass employment. That is an improvement, but it is not what the European Semester is intended for. The Semester is supposed to help realise the Europe 2020 strategy. There are five key indicators for the strategy – namely, employment, research and development and innovation, education, poverty or social exclusion and climate change and energy. These issues are supposed to be the core issues and the recommendations need to home back in on them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have looked into what account has been taken of all these different indicators. Our investigation showed that the Commission had put forward all kinds of recommendations that do not correspond to the key indicators. I will give some examples. When it comes to the important issue of energy saving, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have not even set a target, yet the Commission does not even mention these two Member States in the recommendations. A second example concerns the R&amp;D budget. Here, too, the Netherlands has said that it will not attain the stipulated three per cent target, but will instead reach 2.5%. I have put questions to the Commission about this. What was the Commission’s response? They said that 2.5% is also good. In other words, the three per cent target is absolutely not important to the Commission. In that case, it should say so.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the Commission’s position, simply make it clear that the Europe 2020 strategy is no longer important and that we simply need to look at the economic indicators. Be honest about it. We want the Europe 2020 indicators to be properly looked at and for that to be a democratic process. Involve the European Parliament, the national parliaments and civil society organisations and look at all the indicators, or else be honest and ditch the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the issue of the European Semester is, above all, a political issue. In my opinion, the application of the European Semester is anti-social, anti-democratic and reactionary, because the Member States, under political pressure and threats from the Commission, are adapting their fiscal targets and budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Its application basically denies each Member State any facility to apply an alternative growth policy, regardless of the government it has put in power. On the contrary, regardless of the policy approved by each nation, they must apply the neoliberal austerity policies of the European Union. Ultimately, Mr Barroso or his successor, or Mr Rehn or his successor, will decide if unemployed people in Greece are to be paid unemployment benefits, if poor homeless people in Ireland are to be paid welfare benefits, or if workers in Portugal are to be paid EUR 300.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, a measure such as the European Semester, which has no democratic credentials, which infringes the EU Treaties, which breaches and circumvents national parliaments, which circumvents the European Parliament and, more importantly, which circumvents and infringes and disregards the interests of the people, is a threat to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, when decisions on debt management are being taken or have been taken by the leaders of the European Union and by the Greek Prime Minister, if these decisions move in the same direction, then European semesters will not be able to save the day. On the contrary, we shall see an explosive pan-European semester of demonstrations by European workers taking their fate into their own hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since its advent, Member States have to put their economic policy plans on the table in the spring – a procedure that definitely was necessary in order to get to grips with the disastrous financial situation of a number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say, at this point, that I do endorse the technical criticism articulated by my colleagues. Fully realising the potential of the internal market – the economic foundation of the EU – is one of the ten goals in the Annual Growth Survey for 2011 that are supposed to be realised by 2012. We are all called upon to realise this potential, for example, by means of funding infrastructure projects and improving competitiveness, while giving particular consideration to small and medium-sized enterprises and creating green jobs in order to help bring about sustainable growth in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the summit on Sunday, they stressed that they were very much minded to carry out an ambitious European Semester. There was also much talk of learning from the past. The first findings from the current European Semester are sobering, in my view. They confirm the experiences that we, the European Parliament, have had to face in applying the Stability and Growth Pact that has been in place hitherto. Self-monitoring by the Council is not working. It has not worked so far and it never will. Hence, the time is now ripe to move from sweeping lip service in public to useful preventive budgetary policy and coordination and, indeed, for that to be put into writing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, we come back to the same conclusion – we must not rest on our laurels when it comes to strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact. The Community method needs to be further strengthened – there is no doubt about it. We parliamentarians should insist on more transparency and on a public discourse for the annual growth report, for the Commission recommendations and for use by the Member States. The great hope, however, remains with the Commission, and quite rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge that we should exhaust our full potential for improvement together, as simply creating a new instrument does not get us anywhere – it also needs to be used efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two things are linked because without full democratic legitimacy, the Semester runs the risk of being more a bureaucratic exercise than a coordination of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">This limitation certainly relates to the crucial issue of the Union’s competences and Parliament’s prerogatives, which should lie at the very heart of any Treaty reform, which would otherwise be pointless or harmful. This limitation also highlights a problem of effective political will to make immediate use of all the instruments offered by the Treaty in order to strengthen coordination and give Parliament a greater role.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a problem of content. A reading of the Council’s recommendations shows an obvious limitation in the line of economic politics that inspired them: deficit reduction and development of the internal market are necessary but not sufficient conditions for tackling the crisis, and unless there is a major investment plan, they are liable to trigger a vicious circle that may bring us to collapse. The political line of the Semester therefore needs to be the subject of a genuine political debate, which can only take place in the context of the discussions between Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am among those who believe that it is possible to solve the current crisis with the instruments that we already have in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not so long ago, more specifically, only a month ago, that we approved the legislative package of which the European Semester also forms part. It is easy for us to focus already on what is wrong with it instead of using it to our advantage to actually tackle the economic concerns that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly a need for a general and open debate, here in Parliament, for example, on the Commission’s recommendations. However, to condemn the system at this stage is not a particularly wise thing to do in my opinion, because we have not actually seen any tangible results from it.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of sensible things have also been said here today, for example, concerning the fact that the Commission has every reason to reflect on its recommendations with regard to growth. Simply issuing recommendations for how to make savings is hardly likely to lead us out of the crisis in the long term, even though there are countries that do, in fact, have to save money.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let us consider the fact that we have actually created a whole host of new instruments that can help us to solve the crisis, instead of concentrating on criticising them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result is that the whole of Europe has to pay a bitter price. Instead, for example, of giving the Greeks a chance to recover by being outside the euro, they were dragged along within it whatever the cost, thus making further indebtedness easier.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s way of supposedly ensuring greater financial transparency is to employ the latest marketing trick. Brussels’ monitoring of the national budgets, in the form of the European Semester, will end up – in very short order – turning into pure planning bureaucracy that lacks any real content and merely pays lip service to monitoring. The butter mountains and milk lakes of the past are, of course, testimony to the failures of a planned economy at EU level. Growth and success, moreover, cannot be produced to order, as the Troika involved in the Greek rescue has now learnt the hard way.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem that Brussels refuses to see that the single currency has a faulty design and was doomed to fail from the outset as a result of the differing economic conditions of its members. Instead of more centralisation, what we need is to move back to an association of States with equal rights, pursuing their own economic policies. There could, if need be, be a small hard currency zone, provided that the key economic indicators of the countries in question allow this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely for that reason that we are so satisfied with the launch of the European Semester and the integration of the Semester into the ‘six-pack’. If the governance cycle of the Semester is well applied, it can work wonders for the absolutely necessary economic and budgetary integration of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I do smell a rat, and I smell it on the side of the Member States. While it is clear to all observers that the Union lacks the muscle to follow rapid series of realities and events in its reform, we can see that in various Member States, resistance is growing and that national parliaments are beginning to brace themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also share the criticism about the lack of democratic legitimacy. It is high time that there was a fundamental debate about a properly understood subsidiarity approach. Is it on a structural or a political basis that we find ourselves stuck? In any case, we have barriers that need to be removed. In the meantime, however, we must not rest on our laurels – it is not five to midnight, it is actually five past midnight, and all the Member States must implement the agreed measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have the following question to ask: do you not think it is necessary for the Member States to now commit in their own laws or constitutions to balance their budgets? Secondly, I would like to ask: is it not necessary for the national parliaments, as such, to explicitly commit to take the European recommendations in connection with the European Semester and the budget for Europe 2020 seriously? Thirdly, I endorse the question about a more active role for the European Parliament, since without democratic legitimacy, no serious measures can be justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fiscal policy must be a joint action area from now on at EU level. At the same time, the national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes cannot fail to include requirements for stimulating economic growth and investment, guaranteeing a high level of education to all European citizens, providing social protection and creating jobs. In this regard, the annual recommendations made to both Member States and the EU must be sufficiently ambitious to enable the targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this first exercise in implementing the European Semester, the Commission will have to analyse the main problems the EU and Member States are facing and propose clear guidelines for reducing the macro-economic imbalances and stimulating balanced economic growth. I also think, as do other colleagues, that the European Semester can only be improved by fully complying with the powers granted to the European Parliament, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by fully involving Parliament in the process of drawing up the recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the signal from the summit at the weekend in the form of the proposal to further strengthen the Euro Group is worrying. The EU is a union of 27 countries in which all Member States should be involved on equal terms. To create further division now in the EU is the wrong path to take and also a dangerous one. In the European Parliament, too, there is currently talk about a division into euro area states and non-euro area states.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the euro area countries’ will to act, but in troubled times, it is much more important to keep the Union together rather than divide it, even with regard to the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">The economies of all 27 Member States of the EU are closely interwoven. We are interlinked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Harmonisation for its own sake borders on obsessive behaviour. Economic policy should not be about congruence or symmetry: it should be about the particular needs of very different economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Large budget deficits, other things being equal, should be avoided, but there are circumstances in which they might be necessary. Quantitative easing might be necessary as a reflationary measure – something which, of course, is not possible unilaterally within the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be argued that the mechanisms are simply providing a necessary external discipline, forcing Member States into good, rather than bad, economic habits.

Coordination of budgetary policy is very important as a means of coordinating economic policies too, but there have been practical problems with the implementation of this good idea. The European Semester requires genuine cooperation between the various European institutions. It is impossible for the European Parliament only to be informed over the Internet. The public did not vote for Members of the European Parliament who are mere e-mail addresses; they voted for representatives of their interests and that is the first lesson that must be borne in mind. Secondly, however, has the European Semester already gone as far as it can? The answer is no. The European institutions need speed, they need an effective response to the current crisis and, for this very reason, I must say that the news that has been reaching the public over the last week is worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">To be completely honest, I can see further postponements, I can feel excessive indecision, and I can hear talk of studies. Europe does not need studies; it needs decisions for effective economic governance that are based on the European Commission and monitored by the European Parliament, and that take into consideration the interests of all the EU’s citizens rather than simply those of national governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The influence of both the national parliaments and the European Parliament on the European Semester needs to increase. If the process merely results in horse trading between national governments involving very little transparency, as it did this year, it cannot have any great value. Creating real legitimacy requires openness and a proper debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the social perspective, which has consistently been significantly under-represented in this year’s Semester. Poverty, unemployment, inferior working conditions, the social divide and a weakened social security system are aspects that have been ignored, despite the fact that they currently play an absolutely key role in the European economy. The crisis that we are having to deal with is just as much a social one as an economic one.</p>
<p class="contents">One important reason for the distorted set of priorities and analyses is the fact that the social partners and the socially active non-governmental organisations have still not been given a clear role in the process. That is something that must be assigned to them now. Without active, dynamic work in the social sphere, it will not be possible to establish sustainable growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial market has given an extremely robust response in that it has dispelled the illusion that Member States in the euro area were borrowing at relatively equal interest rates. Each Member State is now judged according to its own financial situation and pays interest commensurate with this situation. The second response is given by the new economic governance regulations in the European Union. As part of these new regulations, the European Semester is the main instrument for providing a structured analysis of each Member State’s economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are responsible for ensuring that this Semester is as effective as possible, and we insist very firmly on the responsibility which the Council has for explaining publicly, with sound arguments, the reasons for rejecting some recommendations made by the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Are they trying to make things easier? I do not think so. Today, all Member State governments are fully aware of their responsibility and it is clear that the crisis hits everyone, smaller and larger countries alike. If so, what is the problem? Is the idea bad? No, I think the problem lies in the execution. The evaluations I read are full of clichés: pensions, structural reforms, fiscal stringency, the same things everywhere, and mountains of documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this what the European Semester is about? Is this what we wanted? Even the best methods can fail if those involved in planning, execution and monitoring do not have a common ground. I would like to believe that Member States do not pursue easier options for their own sake, but rather because of a very clear and simple reason: they cannot do more in this crisis, they have no other options, due to debts, budgetary problems or economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commission is this: do you have a proposal that can transpose best practices into the future, and, of course, not in a static environment, but in a climate characterised by dynamic changes and crisis? The intended economic coordination of the European Semester can only work if it is based on mutual values and objectives, on consensus, where the European Parliament has a central role, since this is the only institution that can maintain independent democratic control over both the Commission and Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures proposed by the European Commission are being implemented hastily, only to be found inadequate after some time. Today’s debate suggests that a similar situation is taking place in the case of the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point however, I would like to express my concern with regard to the calls for the division of the European Parliament into a group of Members who are included in the work relating to overcoming the crisis and a group of Members who are excluded from this process. Attempts to create a two-tier Europe at all levels still exist. Depriving Members from non-euro area Member States of the right to decide about the fate of the single currency is likely to contribute to the entrenchment of divisions rather than to the creation of effective solutions. We should not forget that the majority of these Member States aim to adopt the euro at some stage, and that they are equally interested in improving the mechanisms governing Economic and Monetary Union as are the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we require more cohesion and closer cooperation. The crisis is affecting all Member States. Parliament does not represent Member States or the euro area; it represents all the citizens of the European Union, and the existence of a single currency determines the fate not only of the residents of France, Germany or Greece, but also of the countries striving to adopt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this point, we are only discussing its formal and technical organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dominik, you do not have things easy this morning. You were, however, correct and honest in your assessment that the European Semester does not contain any instruments that help to overcome this crisis. I agree with you. It can deliver only a small contribution. I do believe, however, that we must both attempt to find a solution to the crisis together. I would therefore ask you – do you seriously believe that macro-economic dialogue is actually something that is already taking place at Member State level? I find that highly doubtful. Governments create programmes in order to get re-elected, and you cannot blame them. However, a macro-economic dialogue on the long-term direction of economic policy simply has not taken place thus far. That is something that the governments need to learn first.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, do you therefore support the idea that we should have a larger European budget in order to balance out these macro-economic deficits, to a certain extent, on the basis of the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, do you also support the call for single market governance, in other words, that we should have more EU regulations and therefore have to regulate less? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission should understand that we, the Parliament, could be their ally in exercising control over Member States.

However, what we are talking about here is a political issue and the question I would ask is as follows: can we have political coordination without democracy? What, in the end, happens to European Parliament scrutiny? What happens to national parliaments’ scrutiny of their own major budgetary choices? However, if the issue were technical, as has been said here, we would then be talking about a variable technique, because, as we know, the Council has substantially eased the conditions for the four countries on the waiting list – France, Italy, Hungary and Spain – in comparison with those for countries that have been bailed out. What model of intergovernmentalism is this, then, that allows Germany to express its opinions about Portugal, but does not allow Portugal to express its opinions about Germany? I ask only that you pay attention to this, Commissioner: no problem of democratic legitimacy can be solved by asking the Members of this House to consult information on the Internet. That is a problem of exclusion from information, not of exclusion from democracy, and that is what we are talking about here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most fundamental change introduced by the European Semester is the fact that European-level coordination of fiscal and economic policies now happens before national decisions are finalised. Until this year, national policies and budgets had been assessed at EU level only after national decisions. This is a major change and, as has been mentioned by many Members today, it implies an increased democratic responsibility for EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This calls for more participation of the EU institutions in national debates. We need to find a way to do this. The Commission has so far preferred to avoid challenging national policies in public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Semester and the ‘six-pack’ will be instrumental in delivering stability, growth and jobs in Europe in the coming years. They will help us avoid the emergence of the kind of fiscal and market economic imbalances that resulted in the current crisis. But you are right: the European Semester is not a crisis management tool. It will deliver results in terms of stability and growth within a few years, which is why two weeks ago, we presented the stability and growth road map, elements of which have been addressed by the European Council and will feature in the Euro summit tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we need to agree on a substantial recovery path for Greece, coordinated recapitalisation of banks and maximising the firepower of our financial backstops. In the longer term, we need to agree on measures for growth and strengthening of economic governance. With the European Semester, we are already making good progress on the last element: building a true economic union.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final note, let me just underline my conviction that the introduction of the European Semester represents a very important step forward. This House has already made an important contribution to making the European Semester more effective, including by bolstering its legitimacy. It will also, in the future, be the crucial role of the European Parliament and national parliaments to continue ensuring the democratic ownership of our joint policy coordination. We are all now called on to put this into practice together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dominant recurring theme in your statements was the issue of democracy within the entire process and the question of who should really be the decision maker in this process. I frequently have the pleasure of taking part in the sittings of a national parliament, in my own country of Poland. The opinions I hear there are exactly the same, only expressed from a slightly different point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliaments continue to assert that they should be making the ultimate decisions in relation to national issues, since in their opinion, they know what is best for their citizens. This is precisely the objective of the European Semester. On the one hand, as the Commissioner pointed out, the European Parliament is, for the first time, involved in the entire decision-making process. On the other hand, the national parliaments are aware of the opinions of the European institutions regarding the economies of particular countries and the fulfilment of priorities as determined by the European Union. They know the position of their governments on budgetary plans and national reform programmes and, acting in complete autonomy, they decide on the extent and manner of implementation, since it is national parliaments which make the ultimate decisions regarding the structure of state budgets – the most important instruments for implementing macro-economic policy in any particular country. I therefore find it hard to agree with the opinion that the entire process is lacking in democracy and transparency, since the institution which is most influential in the whole process is very much included in it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to say whether the whole process, the whole European Semester, is a resounding success or not, since it has not finished yet. We do not know how the national parliaments will accommodate their budgets to EU recommendations concerning the priorities of their countries in macro-economic policy. The objective of the European Semester was, first and foremost, to include national parliaments in the process, to show them and other, mainly national institutions – since they are the ultimate decision makers – future or existing risks to their countries. The aim is to eliminate the macro-economic imbalances that have emerged between the Member States. As outlined by the Commissioner, when monitoring of the entire process was secondary to the process itself, taking place after the budget and the majority of its implementing legislation had been passed, the European Commission and the Council could only indicate to the Member States that the direction that they had taken was wrong, and that certain actions would have a further negative impact on the economic circumstances of a particular country.</p>
<p class="contents">The process has now been reversed and the final decision is left to national parliaments, which are the most democratic institutions in the whole process and are most in touch with the issues facing their citizens and the actions that their countries require. In my opinion, therefore, the structure at least of the European Semester is appropriate and there are no grounds for stating that it is lacking in democratic rules. However, we will not be able to assess how it has been used by its primary addressee, the national parliaments, until a number of months have passed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its purpose is, alongside the ‘six-pack’ and the Stability and Growth Pact, to coordinate macro-economic and budgetary oversight, so as to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets. However, this first European Semester exercise has demonstrated serious failures in institutional terms, since Parliament has only been informed of the Commission’s recommendations and of the Council’s amendments, without the right to any type of political dialogue. As the representative of 500 million European citizens, Parliament cannot just be consulted: there must be space for greater transparency and political debate, thereby creating the legitimacy that this instrument needs. I eagerly await the evaluation of the European Semester once the national budgets and national reform programmes have been approved, so that the improvements in this mechanism can be reanalysed in order that the proposed objectives can be achieved. Once again, I would stress the need for cooperation and for quick decisions, in order that genuine economic governance based on the Commission and monitored by Parliament can be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
