<p class="contents">During the 40 years in which Burma has been under military rule and forced to follow the ‘Burmese way to socialism’, the country has gone from being one of the richest and best-educated in South-East Asia to one of the poorest. The Burmese generals who rule the country, which is one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world, have resisted any kind of pressure from the international community for the past 10 years. Aspects of the Burmese regime that should be particularly condemned include the Burmese generals’ fight against the opposition, the use of chemical weapons by the Burmese army, the failure of the country to cooperate in any way with international organisations, the persecution of ethnic minorities and the political arrests. It is well known that political prisoners, who number around 1 300, are tortured during interrogations, and international standards of justice are not observed in political life. Forced labour is an extremely common occurrence, with 800 000 Burmese citizens affected every day. Furthermore, restrictions have been imposed on citizens’ freedom of opinion, movement, information and assembly, as well as on participation in political life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Burmese education system is falling apart. Since 1988, more universities have closed than have opened, due to fears that students will become politically active. Half of the state budget is spent on the military and on maintaining a 400 000-strong army, even though the country is not presently at war. The number of children forced to serve in the army stands at 77 000, and many of them join when they are only 11. Only a very small fraction of the budget is set aside for medical care, and the medical sector is in a disastrous state, with a shortage of basic medicines and qualified staff. Another major problem is the sexual exploitation of young women, girls and children from ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these problems, it would appear that the only chance we have of ensuring that the regime starts to make the necessary changes is to impose tough economic sanctions, targeted at strategic sectors where the regime holds a monopoly, such as oil, gas, timber, the extractive industries, and marine products. UN diplomatic measures are also needed. In fact the UN and the European Union both have a moral duty to intervene and even to interfere in the domestic affairs of a country that commits such gross violations of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands of political prisoners are subjected to mistreatment and torture and denied access to a lawyer or a fair trial. Burma holds the disgraceful record of having more child soldiers than any other country in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It also holds the shameful record of having the world's only imprisoned 60-year-old Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi. On 19 June 2005, her 60th birthday, this remarkable lady will have spent a total of 2 523 days in detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Gross violations have been committed by the Burmese army against ethnic minorities, including summary executions, torture and rape. An estimated one million people have been internally displaced and several hundreds of thousands have fled to neighbouring countries. The organised violence exercised by soldiers against women, including young girls, in areas of internal conflict, is a well-known atrocity in Burma. Hundreds of cases have been documented, with a high percentage of these cases involving gang rape and, in many cases, resulting in the killing of the victim.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group has long supported Mrs Suu Kyi's efforts to bring democracy to her country, and we call for her immediate release from detention. In addition, my Group wishes to see an increased role for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the refugee camps along the Thai-Burmese border and a permanent UN Human Rights Monitor in eastern Burma to investigate thoroughly human rights violations. Furthermore, the ALDE Group will continue to urge the European Union to take every opportunity to put pressure on the Burmese junta to restore democracy in the country. We also support the tourist boycott of Burma and are in favour of the targeted imposition of economic sanctions on Burma in order to encourage a speedy democratic reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These anniversaries shed a very unflattering light on those who, in former times, kept quiet about oppression or did business with those who inflicted it. Let us then give some thought to what judgment future generations will pass on those who, today, do likewise, for the Iron Curtain may well no longer be there, but what has been called the Bamboo Curtain, erected by socialist generals around Burma, is still there, and terrible tragedies are being played out behind it, ranging from brutal violations of the human rights of tens upon thousands of political detainees to the targeted deployment of poison gas against the Karen people. With the use of gas, the attempt is being made to kill off a people or at least to break its spirit. These are terrible things to be going on in the 21st century, and they impose an obligation upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things need to be given particular emphasis. The first is the urgent necessity of our ensuring that Burma does not take over the presidency of ASEAN in 2006. ASEAN is in some sense the EU’s offspring, being a federation like the EU, albeit as yet more economic than political, but it is still our most important partner, and it is intolerable that such an important partner organisation should have a murderous regime at its head.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must, by all political, economic and legal means, oppose those who are still unscrupulous enough to do business with such a regime. The question we must of course always ask ourselves is: what harms the people, and what benefits the people? Cutting the country off completely is obviously not the right way to go about it, but allowing those in power to shamelessly accumulate wealth, while presenting them with only flimsy paper protests about human rights violations, wrecks Europe’s credibility. That is why our words must be backed up with deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Commission – and I would say the same thing to the Council – to adopt, once and for all, a tougher approach to dealing with Burma. Protesting from time to time is useless; instead, we must be systematic in bringing pressure to bear until this repugnant regime is no more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I denounce this resumption of terror. These attacks show that, since our debate in September 2004, the situation, far from improving, has, tragically, become more acute – something highlighted by Mr Posselt and by other previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma/Myanmar is a multi-ethnic state, and has been under military rule with scarcely any interruption since 1962. To this day, the military refuse to allow the National League for Democracy, which won the 1990 elections, to form a government, and the National Assembly meets without democratically elected members. In February 2005, the leaders of numerous opposition parties and ethnic groups were arrested. Despite massive international protest, including – on many occasions – from this House, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest. Forced labour is so widespread that the International Labour Organisation ILO has called on the EU Member States to reconsider their relations with Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Commissioner Dimas, that, with these things going on, I do not understand what the Commission is doing. During this year’s ‘Burma/Myanmar Day’, you presented a report that held out the prospect of increased economic and social cooperation with the regime. The EU is a community of values, first among them the protection of human rights and the safeguarding of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU wants to be able to make a tangible contribution, let it appoint a Special Envoy for Burma. At long last, there must be dialogue between the military junta and the democracy movement. Ethnic groups and minorities must gain acceptance at long last. Humanitarian and social evils must be done away with. Only when there is demonstrable progress in these areas will there be any justification for stepping up aid from the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It also continues to call on the Burmese regime to participate in a substantive dialogue with all the political parties, including the National League for Democracy and all the ethnic groups. It is clear that national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy can only be achieved through a transparent and constructive dialogue between all the legitimate interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission regrets that the terms which might allow the National League for Democracy and all the other legal representatives to participate in the national assembly are not being met.</p>
<p class="contents">As no specific positive developments have been noted in respect of the political situation and human rights in the country and given that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders continue to be detained, the common position of the European Union on Burma/Myanmar was renewed on 25 April for a further year.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious sanctions against the military regime have been maintained and I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that all the representatives of the European Union will continue to take every opportunity to raise specific issues, such as human rights, forced labour, the lack of democratic development and the continuing detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, on the basis of the agreed policy of the European Union, communication channels with the Burmese regime will continue to be kept open. The European Union is ready for direct, substantive and open talks with the regime during high-level Asia/Europe conferences or bilaterally on the fringes of such conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent conference of foreign ministers of ASEAN, the Association of South-East Asian Nations, in Kyoto on 6 and 7 May was an opportunity of the first order to discuss all the European Union's concerns openly and directly with the Burmese leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">These discussions took place both during the ASEAN conference itself and between the EU troika and the Burmese foreign minister, Mr Win. During the meeting between the troika and Foreign Minister Win, he was also given a list of the names of political prisoners about whom the European Union has expressed its concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the chairmanship of ASEAN, the Commission continues to hope that significant progress can be made towards national reconciliation and democratisation and the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in the run up to Myanmar's taking over the chairmanship of ASEAN.</p>
<p class="contents">There is as yet no agreed EU position on its participation in ASEAN conferences if Burma/Myanmar takes over the chairmanship. However, it is clear that a good number of countries have reservations about participating in ASEAN regional meetings unless there are decisive positive developments in Burma/Μyanmar before it takes over the chairmanship.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the efforts being made by numerous parliamentarians in ASEAN in order to pressure Burma/Myanmar into making political changes before it takes over the chairmanship are particularly encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words about Burma Day, which the Commission organised on 5 April and during which a debate was held on the basis of the independent experts' report prepared by two excellently trained consultants. Even though the report also refers to EU policy on Burma/Myanmar, the objective of Burma Day 2005 was to focus the debate on the possibilities for providing aid inside Burma/Μyanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">This aid will not be channelled through the government; it will be implemented transparently and responsibly through UN agencies and non-government organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">EU political sanctions were not debated during Burma Day. All the speakers were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the overall debate on aid and their experience from working inside Burma/Myanmar, not their views on the sanctions.</p>
