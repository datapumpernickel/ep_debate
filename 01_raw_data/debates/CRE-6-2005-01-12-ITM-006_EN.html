When the elderly are injured in road accidents, they do not receive compensation because they cannot earn an income on account of their age.

<p class="contents">The main problem with this proposal is that of striking a balance between, on the one hand, the need to improve victim protection cover – cover for personal and material damage – in the event of a car accident involving a car of relatively low value and the fact, on the other hand, that improvement in cover of this nature will result in a rise in insurance premiums, when the ‘prices’ charged by insurers are not monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect of this issue is the general problem of harmonisation when economic situations vary from country to country. This must be taken into account, especially in southern countries, such as Portugal, which have always had reservations on this issue. Portugal has had a transitional period in which to adapt national legislation. The common position provides for a further transitional period of five years, which I believe strikes a better balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the proposals to raise minimum amounts to EUR 1 million per victim and EUR 5 million per event, regardless of the number of victims, is excessive, particularly the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The development of the internal market, and the increase in Community traffic have meant that for ten years we have needed to update the rules in force. It was therefore necessary to update and strengthen protection through compulsory cover for victims of accidents caused by one motor vehicle, and to ensure greater convergence in the way in which Member States interpret and implement the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With this fifth Directive it will be easier to obtain effective and valid civil liability insurance outside the country of residence, and to sell or buy a vehicle in another Member State. Furthermore, this text increases legal protection for the victims of accidents. I also feel that it is extremely important to highlight Parliament’s proposal as regards a transitional period of up to five years to enable Member States to adapt to the minimum cover amounts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft legislative resolution updates and enhances protection for victims of road accidents through compulsory insurance; it plugs gaps and clarifies provisions in directives so as to ensure greater convergence in the way in which the Member States interpret and implement them; and it provides for solutions to problems that often arise, in order to ensure a more efficient internal market in the area of car insurance. In so doing, it contributes towards modernising and updating European insurance law and, at the same time, looks after the consumers’ interests and ensures that those consumers will enjoy a higher level of cover.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative resolution is thus in line with measures to strengthen protection for the victims of road accidents and seeks to ensure that the injured party is duly reimbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, however, that some flexibility will ultimately prevent a sudden sharp rise in insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel it is extremely important that legislative efforts be made to prevent the use of delaying tactics to renege on the liability guaranteed in the transfer of risk contract.</p>

At the same time, however, I did not think it was the result of chance. What firstly crossed my mind were the lengthy struggles that preceded the 1949 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1961 European Social Charter, with the latter being backed by all the trade unions. These have now borne fruit in the shape of Part Two of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Above all, however, my thoughts turned to the real father of the Constitution, Altiero Spinelli, whose name is not mentioned nearly enough. Spinelli, a member of the Communist Youth who was put under house arrest for ten years by Mussolini, anticipated today’s text right from the European Parliament’s first term as a directly-elected body. Another name to cross my mind was that of Mr Duhamel, who during the last parliamentary term prompted us to hold a public Convention in order to draft this Constitutional Treaty. I therefore came to the conclusion that, as a left-winger, I could lend my support to this draft Constitutional Treaty today without any qualms, as it will open a promising page in the history of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on which we have just voted states that: ‘the greatest advances brought by the Constitution are to be found in the specific area of common security policy’. That is the principal reason why I reject this Constitutional Treaty for the EU. Its Article I-41, paragraph 3 states that ‘the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, which means that the EU’s Member States are obliged to rearm. When we turn to foreign and military policy, we find that the Constitutional Treaty evidently aims to equip the European Union to wage global war. Article I-41, paragraph 1, states that the Treaty is intended to secure operational capacity drawing on military assets, so that the Treaty makes rearmament an obligation. An armaments agency is to be set up to monitor all this and to implement appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector. I think there is a whole array of other points demonstrating why the Constitutional Treaty, which militarises the European Union, must be rejected. That is what I wanted this statement of vote to make clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What this means in practice is that policy initiatives – new ones – are taken first, and then the related powers and responsibilities may be created.

This is exemplified by Parliament’s reinforced role in the decision-making process, the confirmation and strengthening of the subsidiarity principle, the creation of one uniform legal framework and the simplification of the legislative instruments. The extension of Europe’s competences to include defence and asylum policy, and the definition of the European values are important new departures in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution is a step forward. A timid one, yes, but it is still a step forward. That is why the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) supports this step because it stands for a more democratic and transparent Europe, a Europe with a strong public culture built from the bottom up and supported by its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the N-VA regards the Constitution as a missed opportunity. Although three-quarters of European regulations are implemented at local and regional level, the involvement of those regional authorities that implement them is minimal. The regions that make up Europe are not allocated a single (formal) role in the European decision-making process. Apart from a noncommittal paragraph concerning the recognition of the national identity of the Member States, in this Constitution, the Union completely overlooks the institutional reality in various Member States. The continuing denial of this regional dimension is at odds with the idea of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst the Constitution falls short of what Parliament wanted and has enshrined controversial issues, such as the question – extremely important to Madeira and the Azores – of the Union’s exclusive competences in the area of the conservation of marine biological resources, against which a number of opposing views were raised at the Convention, and in the opinion on the Constitution issued by the Committee on Fisheries, I do acknowledge that it represents a welcome compromise and an improvement on the Treaties in force, as mentioned by the joint rapporteurs, and is a significant step towards achieving the European project, from the point of view of both the Member States and the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to highlight the Constitution’s approach to the status of the outermost regions. Not only does the Constitution maintain and strengthen the possibility of modulating the implementation of all European policies to the outermost regions, but it is also confirmed that this article constitutes a valid legal basis that is sufficient to underpin the development of a genuine policy for the outermost regions.</p>

<p class="contents">To begin with, I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because my criticisms of the Constitution outnumber by far the very few aspects of it which could be regarded as slight progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to my grave doubts regarding the construction of a social and political Europe, my most serious criticism relates to the fact that the task of a constitution is to allocate powers and to outline citizens’ rights and duties. The policies and ideological choices set out in the Constitutional Treaty have no place in a constitution, and they preclude any possibility of different policies being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, only one goal was pursued in the drafting of this report, namely that nothing but the positive and ‘progressive’ aspects of the Constitution be mentioned. This exclusion of all criticism, no matter how minor, stands in stark contrast to the reservations voiced by this House when the previous resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not convinced that either this resolution or this Treaty will make it possible to involve our fellow citizens more in European integration, or to respond to their calls for justice, equality and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Treaty provides us with a number of tools that are essential if we wish to make Europe more efficient, easier to understand and more democratic. It does so by clarifying the roles of the institutions, reducing the scope for blocking decisions and increasing the powers of the European Parliament and of its representatives, who have been elected by popular vote.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it fosters Community solidarity and helps ensure genuine cohesion within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it helps ensure social cohesion thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which lays down rules relating to civic, political and social rights. The Treaty also declares Europe’s objectives to be a social market economy, sustainable development and the fight against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it helps ensure territorial cohesion by means of a set of provisions that will help the EU’s regions to manage their own development. The Treaty reiterates the specific nature of the UPRs, and more particularly that of the French overseas territories. By consolidating the mechanisms under which derogations may be granted from Community rules, it provides real protection for the overseas territories, thus counteracting a destructive mindset that regards Europe as a uniform and homogenous territory.</p>

What they have in common is that they are not subject to any kind of democratic control after their appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it will be a state lacking a soul and an identity, as it will turn its back on its Helleno-Christian roots and agree to Turkey’s integration, despite the public’s opposition, and will believe only in globalisation, competition and the market.</p>

I had no hesitation in voting against this report, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is out of place for the European Parliament to recommend that the Member States ratify or reject the Treaty, as final decisions on this matter and completion of the ratification process fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the sovereign national authorities designated for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">How one views this so-called European Constitution is an entirely separate issue. In my opinion, ratification of this Constitution would not further either Poland’s or Europe’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I have repeatedly noted how inappropriate it is for there to be no reference to God or the Christian tradition in the preamble to the Treaty. The lack of any such reference means that the truth about our continent’s history is blatantly ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point of contention is the revision of the Treaty of Nice, which has not even been given the chance to prove itself in practice. The provisions of this Treaty on weighted voting within the European Council, which would have been to Poland’s benefit, have been watered down by the Constitutional Treaty, without their influence on the functioning of the Communities having been assessed in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I have concerns regarding a number of other provisions in the so-called European Constitution, for example increasing the unjust privileges granted to the eastern <span class="italic">Bundesländer</span> of the Federal Republic of Germany under previous treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group is opposed to this Constitution for a number of reasons. We denounce the neo-Liberal and socio-economic component in it which, under the guise of ‘free trade’ undermines public services and denies national and local authorities the right to determine for themselves how they want to organise their public services. We are strongly opposed to the militarisation of Europe that is apparent in the Constitution, including in the paragraph obliging Member States to increase their defence budgets. We reject this Constitution, because it reinforces the Union’s undemocratic structure and does not do a great deal to improve it.</p>

In criticising it, we are not arguing from the restricted vantage point of the nation state.</p>
<p class="contents">What we criticise is that the treaty aims to further militarise the European Union to the point of enabling it to wage war on a global scale. It is intended to secure ‘operational capacity drawing on military assets’. The Constitution requires rearmament, in that ’the Member States are obliged to progressively improve their military capacities’, a process to be supervised by an ‘agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments’, which will also implement ’appropriate measures to strengthen the industrial and technological basis of the defence sector’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also critical of the way in which the principles of neo-liberalism are to be enshrined in the Constitution. The general ‘Objectives of the Union’ do admittedly gloss over matters by talking in terms of ‘a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, but the part that actually deals with policy then speaks in plain language of a commitment to the ‘principle of an open market economy with free competition’.</p>

<p class="contents">I have no qualms about applauding the broad outlook of a European constitutional text. Yet once the people have been consulted, let us draw it up using fully democratic, participatory and representative processes, interacting with the public, in an assembly specifically elected for this purpose, as suggested at the Intergovernmental Conference. I am always dismayed by the climate of concealment and manipulation, the lack of loyalty to the public, the fact that often one thing is said and then something different is done and the blatant way in which the rule of law has been brushed aside – a sure sign that ‘anything goes’, so long as it goes in a particular direction.

<p class="contents">As a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted in favour, because I firmly believe that this represents a step forward towards consolidating the European social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens’ social rights emerge clearly strengthened due to the fact that the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights has been incorporated into the Constitution – recognition of the public’s place at the heart of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social cohesion has been reaffirmed as a key objective of the EU. New norms have been introduced as regards a high level of employment, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of social justice, social protection, equality between men and women and a high level of education and health, the promotion of sustainable development and respect for services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s role on the international stage has also been strengthened, in the fight to eradicate poverty and in the promotion of sustainable development and fair trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, new provisions will facilitate the participation of the citizens, social partners and representatives of civil society in EU discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Following over half a century of European integration and numerous Treaties, the European Constitution is the one that brings by far the most visible and most practical benefits to the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It fails to mention that too many areas of policy are still left to intergovernmental cooperation and that important areas are still subject to veto.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the constitutional regions in the European decision-making process remains precarious. Part III of the Treaty makes it clear that the Union lacks social order and confirms choices in favour of the neo-Liberal model. The European Union is still too little in the way of a security union and is at risk of emphasising the deployment of military means in favour of conflict prevention. Since these observations are not included in the report, I have voted against it. That does not prevent me from campaigning in the next few months with <span class="italic">Groen!</span> in favour of ratification of the Treaty in the federal, Flemish and Brussels parliaments. After all, the Constitution is an enormous step forward and in the event of non-ratification, we will fall back on the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are less efficient, transparent and democratic than the present Treaty establishing a European Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
