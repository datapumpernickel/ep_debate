<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, non-state actors, non-governmental organisations, private companies, trade unions and civil society have a major role to play in the European Union's development programmes. They are crucial to us for four reasons. First, good development practice means that aid is successful when the beneficiaries themselves participate in the programmes that deliver that aid – helping people to help themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, non-state actors provide pluralism, alternative views and alternative experiences to those of governments, views which are at best representative of grass-roots communities of marginalised people, who in turn are representative of those in greatest need.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, a strong civil society is part of a healthy democracy, providing scrutiny of governments and promoting principles of anti-corruption and good governance. Democracy and development go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, from a European perspective, the best of independent actors – renowned non-governmental organisations like Oxfam or the Save the Children Fund from the UK, <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> from France and so on – have helped to deliver public support to the whole notion of development, as well as providing a record for ensuring the swiftest, most direct and efficient provision of aid which, in itself, commands that public support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the proposed resolution lays down, that relationship is not always a comfortable one. For example, non-governmental organisations are themselves not immune from criticism. I supported Commissioner Nielson when he made proper criticisms regarding the management and efficiency of the former liaison committee of EU development NGOs in Brussels. It is true that non-state actors can suffer from the same problems of bad governance for which we sometimes criticise governments of developing countries. Yet the Commission's communication and this Parliament's conviction is based on the principle that we can do better.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the active cooperation of the Commissioner's services, but the results of my questionnaire – showing that non-state actor consultation took place in only half of 63 beneficiary countries and that the totals by region record only 2 or 3% of the total funding provided going to non-state actors – represents a challenge for the time ahead. It is a challenge which can and must be met in the forthcoming mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Commission supports my proposal in the resolution for one staff member per delegation in developing countries to be responsible for NSA consultation and participation. We have taken such steps in relation to financial management and it is right that we give equal weight to quality as well as quantity of aid. I hope the Commissioner tonight will not simply support the principle of training in this respect, but will also commit himself to beginning to deliver it in practice. I propose in the resolution that this process be supported through the creation of multi-stakeholder committees by country or region, a proposal which is meant not to increase bureaucracy but to ensure systematic means of participation by NSAs.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commissioner has a healthy scepticism of my interest in budget quotas, but the 15% identified in his own programming guidelines should provide a firm baseline in the budget for non-state actor participation – 85% for governance seems not an unduly small amount. I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has now invited MEPs, including myself, to contribute to the reform of the specific NGO co-finance budget line. I advance the proposal that the delegation should manage its own small-scale, capacity-building funds – a model which is effective for some Member State interventions, including those in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I accept that non-state actor involvement is not simply – nor principally – an issue of funding. It is now five years since the Commission established a small, informal working party under the then Director-General of DG Development to recommend a new relationship with non-governmental organisations. The evolution of those discussions has, in part, taken in Commissioner Kinnock's reform programme and the White Paper on Governance from Mr Prodi. Now it includes the proposal from the European Convention for a legal base on civil dialogue. In development specifically it has included the legally-binding, contractual participation laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, a principle that we believe should be extended to the EU's relationship with all regions of developing countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is now time to move from discussion about NGOs, civil society and non-state actors in order to effect real change and improvement. Commissioner Nielson's communication gives us the opportunity to do just that. We must, we should and we will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> There are many different aspects to the discussion on the role of non-state actors. One is that we deliberately played up expectations, especially in the ACP countries following the Cotonou Agreement, making an interesting breakthrough in giving them a role in the debate over country strategies and also starting a new activity of being able to fund the different non-state actors in these countries more directly. But these activities of NGOs and so on in our partner countries are not something we run or organise. It depends on the political situation, the level of democratisation, the character of the society. In some countries these things are very new. That is why the feedback of how successful this inclusiveness has been is somewhat mixed. We are pushing for it, but I cannot accept that the Commission can or should be made responsible for how successfully this can be done in another country. It is not our country. There is a limit to our powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite optimistic. We have compared our attempts to the somewhat similar ones to broaden participation in the discussions in the poverty reduction strategy paper process, handled by the World Bank with the same countries in most cases. When we compare the achievement of involving civil society, we have had much more success.</p>
<p class="contents">This should not be seen as a civil society beauty contest between the Commission and the World Bank. It is of more interest that both urge the partner countries to do the same thing. The partner countries could then see that different partners in development work would actually like civil society in these countries to be more involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil society relations with NGOs in a European context are a somewhat different story. Mr Howitt wrote something in the explanatory statement that I disagree with. It is simply wrong. He says that the organisations themselves complain that any consultation they enjoy is entirely ad hoc and that the Commission can be accused of only consulting when it wants to legitimise its own perspective. I have checked whether the new umbrella organisation of development NGOs agrees with this description of the relationship. It does not. So what Mr Howitt has presented here is not what I have heard from the same NGOs. Of course both the NGOs and Mr Howitt could be wrong. I do not claim that one of them must be right.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, today we are in a constructive phase of the discussions. My preference is to put the emphasis on an exchange of substance rather than formalising things between us. This is well understood. The hard-core of cooperation – the funding and administrative working relationship – is better than it has been for many years. It is possible to keep it that way. What is most interesting in terms of the funding aspect is that the NGO budget of EUR 200 million per year is only a small part of the total activity that we are funding through NGOs. The total amount of money per year going through NGOs is closer to EUR 1.5 billion – food aid, food security, part of the humanitarian aid for NGOs, and a great volume of project implementation work where we use different NGOs in the field. This should be given more attention. The EUR 200 million budget is so heavily in demand that we have an impossible situation if all of the discussion is concentrated there, especially in view of the ten new Member States that will join the EU. We should take care to provide good opportunities for NGOs in those countries to get in on the action. The EUR 200 million budget for NGOs should be looked at with a view to making sure that civil society in the new Member States does not feel marginalised because of stiff competition for that specific budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to continuing the discussion, not only with Parliament and Mr Howitt, but also with the NGO community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you look at the United Nations, there are 72 000 registered NGOs drawing EUR 7 billion every year. Certainly, the NGOs have got their act together. They know what to do, where to go and source the founds.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, private companies – and they are non-state actors too – do not enjoy the same status, privilege or funding. I am very much in favour of tilting the balance to established private corporations with a good track record in development and in developing countries, so that they may also receive aid that would be very well utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have two categories that the EU has never considered. I know they are slightly off-track and perhaps Parliament has discussed this. One of them is service clubs, such as Rotary Clubs, which do a fantastic job at a very low cost. Others are missionaries, particularly in Africa. Very selective use of mission work in developing countries can bring substantial benefit to the very poorest in these countries for very low sums of money. I have personal experience of both Rotary Clubs and missionaries working in East Africa for very little money. They provide substantial support for local communities.</p>
<p class="contents">But today I am going to focus on accountability. It is known that a large percentage of money received by non-state actors, particularly NGOs, is spent on administration, including high salaries, first- or club-class fares, and bills for expensive hotels. There are so many seminars which now, with information technology, are totally unnecessary. Transparency International is supposed to monitor the role of such bodies, but it has not done the job it is supposed to have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pointing out these things for this Parliament and for Commissioner Nielson to put at the back of their minds because much has already been said and will be said. But I want to highlight one thing and I hope Commissioner Nielson will take note of this. Whenever the EU gives any aid to any poor country, please let us inform the population what we are doing: how much money we are giving for each sector and to which actors or players or stakeholders this money is being given. Because the poor will be the best invigilators, the best inspectors, the best reporters to our EU delegations if they find that this EU money is being misused. If money has been given to the government through budgets and not spent in an appropriate manner the people will know and will report. If money is given to NGOs and it is not utilised people will know. But if they do not know what the EU gives, for what sectors, there is no inspection, there is no vigilance and there is no feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say one last thing. There is aid fatigue and it is important that whatever the EU gives, which is very generous, it is spent well. I wish Commissioner Nielson much luck in what he is doing. He has my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, he did significant work by means of a questionnaire aimed at ascertaining the situation with regard to the participation of NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that NGOs have had a decisive influence on the current configuration of a more open international society and on the democratisation of a system of international relations which until very recently was restricted to states and intergovernmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the active participation of NGOs in the implementation of the Community’s development policy represents the principal added value of European cooperation, since it provides a degree of effectiveness which development policies do not have when they are implemented solely within an intergovernmental context.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this is not a round trip, although there is no doubt about the need for development processes to be participatory if they are to be effective and sustainable. Only in a minority of cases do non-governmental organisations and civil organisations in the countries receiving aid participate in the creation and implementation of the development actions benefiting them. As Mr Howitt’s report points out, we will ask the Commission for data on the participation of non-state actors in the production of strategy documents by region and country.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that programmes and projects drawn up in this way are mainly financed by means of the EDF, to which, unfortunately, the non-state actors do not have direct access. The other source of funding, the decentralised cooperation line B7-6002, involves very small amounts – 3% of the amount provided for NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The structuring of civil society, including companies, NGOs, local organisations and the like, is essential to development processes and cooperation relationships. We therefore trust that the Commission – despite the fact that it has expressed some reservations in relation to the report – will stipulate our requirements as soon as possible in this regard and respond to the commitment made with the international community by means of the millennium declaration – to which end the United Nations adopted an agenda for action which involves 1 300 non-governmental organisations – to create a mechanism for permanent consultation with non-state actors and improve open and integrated dialogue, which the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, calls participatory development. There must be permanent consultation with non-state actors in order to combat extreme poverty in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public involvement in cooperation with developing countries is at the heart of our concerns. This communication should underpin real cooperation with non-state actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Who are these non-state actors though? Who are these privileged partners? Are they partners imposed on us? We believe that participation should involve a wide range of actors, including partners from the South, and it should prevent the poorest countries from being marginalised. This means that a proper mechanism needs to be established to optimise participants' representation. This communication should not allow the Commission and the governments of developing countries to legitimise their actions by treating non-state actors as pawns.</p>
<p class="contents">The populations of the countries of the South themselves should be able to democratically appoint their representatives and organise themselves collectively through associations, trade unions and grassroots organisations. It is this process that we need to support by providing the structural aid needed to guarantee that non-state actors have the independence that is vital for dialogue and for the involvement of all strata in society. It is incumbent on European companies to stop banning trade union organisation and rights of association for workers and local people. On the contrary, they should encourage such activities. At present civil society is only recognised in the text of the Cotonou Agreement. It needs to come off the printed page and be put into practice!</p>
<p class="contents">When we revise the ALA Regulation, it is essential to include this aspect in our cooperation with the countries of Latin America and Asia, which would also make it possible to make funds available to non-state actors in those countries. Involving non-state actors in their governments' development strategy is essential to guaranteeing pluralism, freedom of expression and democracy, which underpin the European Union's missions throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased to welcome this report by Mr Howitt. It opens up important avenues that we must not fail to explore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Support from the Commission for non-state actors must be ensured, especially in countries where such support is not provided by government agencies. In doing this, those NSA projects that already have a successful track record should, in the interests of continuity, remain under NSA management, thus averting any risk that EU funding will trickle away into government structures.</p>
<p class="contents">It has long been undisputed in the EU that civil society is an important pillar of its social development. The contributions made by civil society during the European Convention’s negotiations on an EU constitution are a recent example of this. Yet the increasingly robust civil society in the ACP states had no chance of participating in the negotiations on the current Cotonou Agreement. This, in my view, is where the Commission wasted an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Development Minister condescended to hold a joint press conference with a number of NGOs at the time, but she failed to give adequate support to civil society’s direct participation in the negotiations. Of course, there are still some developing countries that deal with aid funds in a fairly arbitrary way. That is the flip-side of the developing countries’ greater individual responsibility for the formulation of development policy, which is what we are seeking to achieve. Nonetheless, part of the balance can undoubtedly be restored by a strong civil society in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hardly surprising that most governments in the ACP countries reject such demands. For many ACP governments, non-state actors are still synonymous with opposition. It is even more important, therefore, for the Commission to take this step in the right direction at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to focus this evening on a group of non-state actors to whom the report does not give explicit credit. The report mainly refers to two categories of non-state actor: the trade unions, on the one hand, and private sector actors, on the other. It omits to mention one group of non-state actors which also meet the ‘non-governmental organisation’ criterion, by which I mean the independent political foundations. Being non-profit organisations, they cannot be categorised as non-state actors from business or industry. They are autonomous, even though their policy programmes are based on the political movements. In every case, however, they are non-governmental organisations. They are funded from within Europe. Their management and funding are subject to the most stringent financial controls and performance audits. They are established in most Member States and in a total of more than eighty countries worldwide, and they are recognised by the local partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, the foundations cover a wide range of fields: poverty alleviation, good governance, pluralist democracy, human rights, promoting SMEs, ‘green’ business, rule-of-law structures, control of security forces, healthcare, education and training in developing countries, etc. They develop synergies and work with many partners, especially NGOs. Until now, these foundations have mainly relied on national sources of funding. However, various functions have now been defined at European level for which these foundations have been qualifying themselves worldwide for decades. They are therefore natural partners for the EU in fulfilling these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Konrad Adenauer Foundation or the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, for example, had not been present in a country such as Zimbabwe in recent years, many NGOs and civil society would have been without major partners to support their commitment to human rights, democracy and good governance. For this reason, the independent political foundations should also be given particular consideration in the present and, above all, in the future debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not regard Mr Nielson as someone who is thin-skinned, but I believe that statement did not do him justice. It may be true that Mr Howitt may be wrong, as may the NGOs, but is it not equally true that so might the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">For the record, comments were properly made to me pointing out that there is insufficient NGO involvement in agenda preparation and presentation in the Commission's twice-yearly meetings with Brussels-based development NGOs. The NGOs I consulted are part of the public record. Indeed, I produced an appendix to my report that listed them and this was passed to the Commissioner's service. Perhaps, rather than rejecting the criticism, the Commissioner should reflect on why – if it is true – it might be that NGOs are saying something slightly different to him than they are saying to this Parliament. Good governance is surely an issue for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
