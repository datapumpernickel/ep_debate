<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Mr President, in this second reading I would like to present a legal report that is broad in scale. Its purpose is to bring up to date the European Union’s most important directive regarding equality at work, which was originally enacted in 1976. Society has changed a great deal in a quarter of a century, so the Committee has worked hard to bring all the issues being raised in modern times to this report. I would like to thank my colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive, fruitful co-operation we have had prior to this second reading also.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, for the first time, the Commission has proposed binding action for the Member States to adopt in order to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. Up till now there have just been recommendations and there have been very different practices among the various Member States. Now the European Parliament is repeating its demand, which the Council has not approved, that the Member States should oblige employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. The Committee has found that a certain system that may be very useful in preventing and remedying damage resulting from sexual harassment is that each workplace should have a confidential counsellor people can turn to in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue is that the directive seeks to strengthen rights associated with maternity, adoption and parenthood in general and to protect mothers in particular – but also fathers – from the sort of discrimination shown to young parents. Every day we hear examples of how employers still ask young women whether they intend to have children in the next few years, and this is how a very large number of people seeking employment might become the victims of serious discrimination. This has already been illegal in the past but this discrimination must still be absolutely prevented. The European Parliament is proposing that this directive will serve to bring this about once and for all. This also covers the issue whereby a person must have the right to return to the same job, or at least a similar one, and with the same terms and conditions of employment, after a period of maternity leave, for example. As rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment in which I also want to emphasise that the unfavourable treatment of fathers must be declared to be discrimination forbidden under this directive. It is absolutely vital that Parliament tomorrow adopts the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and some groups, in which both fathers and mothers are protected and which refer, for example, to exercising the right to parental leave, so that discrimination cannot take place. We all understand how important co-ordinating work and family life is for young families and our children too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent to see that recently the Commission has also realised that day care is an important matter and that it will be possible in this way to raise the employment rate for women to that for men in order to increase the number of employees. That obviously does not happen unless there is a good system of day care. This directive does not lay down legal provision for new rights, but seeks to protect those who want to exercise their rights – both fathers and mothers – from discrimination at work.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted. This is a very strategic proposal, as equality must be actively and systematically promoted at grassroots level, in other words, where people work. It has been a joy to see that employers’ organisations have also actually approved this idea. I hope that we will get wide support for this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for its very constructive attitude. I believe that, united, we will see a decision taken on this directive soon. If the Council does not approve all Parliament’s proposals legislative conciliation may be begun very swiftly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, there is a German proverb that says good things are worth waiting for. However, I remain to be convinced, especially now that I have heard what the rapporteur had to say, that everything will turn out for the best in tomorrow's vote on the recommendation for a second reading on the directive amending the important 1976 directive. I honestly have to say that the progressive Council common position came as a pleasant surprise after the botched first reading in this House, which my group had very little to do with. I could even have lived with the text proposed by the Council. We could have avoided the risks of having too many new amendments at this stage and wasting valuable time on laborious negotiations on resolutions. But that was not to be, since the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities once again failed to recognise the truism that the better is the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of our persistence, Mrs Ghilardotti and I, the spokespersons of the two major groups in this House, which are needed to muster 314 votes, have succeeded in persuading the rapporteur not to table yet more superfluous amendments which really give women out there very little except semantic self-opionatedness and confused ideology. We now have before us a number of new amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which the rapporteur belongs. This directive is one of the EU's most important pieces of legislation. It needs to be clear and legally tenable. Above all, it should not be overloaded with excessive verbiage that really has no place in a legal text which will have to be interpreted by the judges of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Those judges to whom I have read the newly tabled definitions of harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace are totally horrified.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I wish to emphasise that the Council has recognised men's right to paternity leave. We really had to use our powers of persuasion to convince the rapporteur not to include in the text the idea that not only any discrimination against women but also against men in connection with pregnancy or maternity should be regarded as discrimination in the context of this directive. However, we ultimately succeeded in making it clear that men can still not become pregnant and accordingly cannot give birth!</p>
<p class="contents">At the last moment, the rapporteur – who tabled an amendment contrary to the agreement we had reached – wanted to reinsert a provision to the effect that discrimination against men and women in the context of reconciling family and career duties counts as discrimination for the purposes of the directive. This would have no benefit at all, apart from encouraging litigation, and especially litigation advocated by people who exploit woolly provisions of this kind. Many of us still have problems with legal actions taken by associations and the requirement for employers to produce complicated annual reports and statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to mention equal pay. There is a directive dating from 1975 on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. That directive is certainly in need of improvement, but in its own context and not this one. We are calling on the Member States to take measures to ensure that employers promote equal pay for equal work in a planned and systematic way. That is mistaken for a number of reasons. First of all, there is the autonomy of the two sides of industry – the employers and the unions. In this context, any demand that employers should promote equal pay for equal work would fall short of the provisions of the 1975 equal pay directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a French proverb that says ‘<span class="italic">Superflue, chose très nécessaire</span>’. However, that does not apply to legislative texts. I hope that in the interests of equal treatment of men and women we will concentrate on the essentials and eliminate anything superfluous when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points, which will improve the common position, in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed. Although the common position recognised Parliament’s position at first reading on a precise definition of direct and indirect discrimination – which we welcome – we feel that it is necessary – and this is an important amendment – to provide precise definitions of harassment, sexual harassment and the procedures for combating it, including preventive measures. We also feel that it is important to keep our amendment reducing the derogations provided for by the Commission and the Council in respect of the implementation of the directive, and that it is necessary to reinforce protection of maternity and paternity rights, including in cases of adoption, providing effective safeguards against discrimination against parents using the rights they are entitled to<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is one point which I am sure will be discussed in conciliation, for the Commission too expressed reservations regarding this point in its amended position, and it is the provision for positive measures laying down specific advantages. We felt that it was important to include them because that consolidates the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point which we feel should still be included is the laying down of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, leaving it to the Member States to identify procedures, an issue which we have also addressed in other debates in this very Chamber and which we endorsed with the vote on the report on information and consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is necessary to make clear, as we have done, the concept of protection for victims, the extension of this protection to trade union representatives and the need for the bodies created to apply the principle of equality to be provided with adequate resources so that they can lend appropriate legal and other assistance to the victims of gender discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also clarify the provision made for<span class="bold"> </span>collective action to be brought in the event of breaches of the directive and the requirement for employees to draw up equal opportunities plans. The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee. Regrettably, however, I have to tell the rapporteur that we do not support the two amendments she tabled together with the Liberals and the GUE, not so much as regards the content as because we feel they do not achieve anything substantial in legislative terms and, on the contrary, inappropriately go against the compromise reached, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow with a very wide majority in this House to give us more power in conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She therefore deserves all credit for the emphatic result that is now before us. Many necessary improvements have been made to the measures against sexual intimidation and in connection with adoption leave and a woman’s right to return to her old job after maternity leave. If the Commission and the Council are serious about the equal treatment of men and women, they would do well to adopt all these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I was astonished to find out from my Christian-Democratic counterparts that pregnancy is a purely female issue. On the contrary: it is of the utmost importance for men to be given the opportunity to be more involved in the new life that they have helped create.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights. We simply do not want men who wish to make use of their existing national rights, for example, to three –days’ leave, to be prevented from doing so. In the view of the liberal group, unlike that of the two major groups, it consequently seems hardly too much to ask for men and women to be able to make use of existing rights to combine work and care tasks without experiencing discrimination. We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the green-liberal-GUE amendment on mainstreaming is also an important addition. I therefore hope that the others will also support us in this and that we indeed face a more equal future backed by a broad majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contains a number of major failings. There were hardly any innovative ideas in it, except for how to tackle sexual violence, something which, for a directive which is already 25 years old, is telling.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is, of course, positive that sexual intimidation is recognised as a form of discrimination, particularly against women, but recognition is as far as it goes. There is no regulation providing for a possible preventative policy, and the protection of witnesses is not regulated properly either. In addition, there is no coherent regulation of sanctions in the event of this form of discrimination taking place. It can be likened to driving through a set of red traffic lights. You are allowed to drive, no one is stopping you from doing so, and no measures are taken. Moreover, the penalty is extremely lenient.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to protect women better after pregnancy, in those countries where this is regulated, fathers should be given the same protection as mothers, so that work and family life can be combined. Hence, also the green amendment to establish one regulation for both mothers and fathers so that fathers can look after their children more but are also protected in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear majority in this House in favour of regulating a number of more specific matters. Most of these matters, however, belong in other and separate directives, such as the pregnancy directive and equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the Commission has proved unable to draft a number of amendments to directives which are more tailored to the current needs of women. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore urges the Commission once again to table amendments of this kind to existing directives, possibly in the form of a codification of the male and female equality <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We are meanwhile awaiting the Commission proposal on male and female equality outside the employment process with bated breath.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express the hope that the Belgian Presidency, given its own progressive legislation in this respect, succeeds in convincing the Member States of the importance of approving the directive by 2 January and that it can approve this directive under the Presidency of Mrs Onkelinkx. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, Mrs Hautala, for having done so much work, which was not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to explain why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I support the amendment by Mrs Hautala. The Commission is certainly willing to recognise the right of fathers to look after their children. We have the recommendation on the protection of workers who look after their children. Why stop, though, when things are going so well? We now need, and this is the purpose of our amendment, to acknowledge that inequality, or discrimination in other words, can exist, with regard to fathers, when they want to look after their children. Why did the Committee on Women’s Rights not go this far? Personally, I do not understand this and I would hope that we are a little more reasonable in the future. What will happen if we are? Not only more quibbling, as Mrs Lulling believes, but, quite simply, better recognition of what is needed – not only by women, but by men as well – in order to be able to have both a family and a career. If we do not do both, we are not living in the twenty-first century, as Mrs van der Laan said. That is why I believe that this amendment simply provides the possibility of extending the right of fathers, something that we also hope for and want to acknowledge. That is why I think it is important to support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would now like to highlight several points that are new in these proposals for amendments. On the one hand, the introduction of adoption is very important, this is something new, which we must weigh up. Next, I must say that my group supports the need to set out some positive measures. We must not be satisfied with dealing with this at arm's length, we must clearly define these measures and this is what has been done, as a solid legal instrument will be the result. I feel that we must also support the possibility of associations and organisations commencing proceedings. In doing this, we recognise that there will not just be individuals faced with a law or faced with proceedings, but also bodies which can support these individuals. This may be the reason that, whilst it is worthwhile, and whilst we can welcome the protection of workers’ representatives who support complainants against discrimination, on the other hand, we have done away with the protection of possible witnesses, or of individuals who witness the harassment or discrimination that some individuals experience, and I think this is a real pity. I personally deplore this, even though we did not table an amendment on this for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, these are the points that I wanted to make, on behalf of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has stressed on many occasions that equal opportunities for men and women must be more than just a principle. Equal opportunities is a concept, a definition which must be translated into a genuine effort by the institutions to ensure, first and foremost, genuine equal treatment of men and women as regards access to work and professional training. What is more, working women must also be able to choose whether to take the opportunity to have a family and bring up children without this jeopardising their professional careers through no fault of their own. Indeed, society must be re-educated to see motherhood not just as a woman’s right but also as an opportunity for society as a whole, considering, not least, that one of the causes of the falling birth rate is precisely the fact that many women are discouraged from having children by the rigid mechanisms of the employment world. For precisely this reason, we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but, in order to genuinely protect working mothers, we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave, allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the European Union should increasingly promote all such instruments – social, legal and economic – which can provide strong, practical – as opposed to theoretical – support for women, especially working women, and thus provide strong support for families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive has led to many hours of work, meetings and agreements between the different groups in order to achieve a text that is acceptable to the majority of the House, as well as the Council and the Commission. It has not been easy, but foremost has been the desire for a legal text which is a good instrument for providing women with equal access to the labour market under equal conditions and for allowing them to reconcile family and professional lives, which still causes women enormous problems, especially young women.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1(2), which guarantees that women retain their job after maternity leave, is of the greatest importance. Not because it is an innovation, since it is included in most national legislations, but because, despite this, retaining jobs and continuing professional promotion after maternity are still creating enormous problems for women. These problems principally affect women, but the directive lays down that, when a father has paternity leave, he can have the same guarantees as women, although this leave is after the specific leave for childbirth, which is exclusive to women.</p>
<p class="contents">Also included are positive measures which promote the presence of the least-represented sex in a specific working sector, in order to allow greater equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men: sexual harassment, which will not only be prosecuted and punished, but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies. Although we are aware that small companies may have problems complying with this directive, we believe that it is an important achievement for equality between men and women. I hope that in the end it will help women and not create additional problems for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal became necessary because appeals had been made to the European Court of Justice in over 40 cases. The most prominent cases, which we in the European Parliament have also been very much involved in, a point I would like to reiterate, were the Kalanke and Marshall cases. These cases have important ramifications not only in Germany, but have also led to a degree of legal uncertainty throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The anti-discrimination provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Articles 141 and 3 give us a clear legal basis for amending this directive now so as to improve the position of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the extensive amendments at first reading are reflected in the common position. That is our first achievement. Direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, positive action – these are now all covered by the common position. Nevertheless, we are now going a step further. We want to protect not only mothers but also fathers, something that, as is reflected here, originally met with some resistance in this House. But that is what we expect. I think that we now need to find some clearer wording. In the course of various extended working sessions, we have managed to achieve a broad consensus in this Parliament on 15 compromise proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I accordingly wish to recommend that my group should stick to this compromise. Our objective remains that of rapidly improving the position of both men and women who are committed to their family, and working towards reconciling professional and family commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to create a clear legal framework. That is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible. We hope that the compromise before us here will hold up and that the Commission and the Council will accordingly also display a willingness to agree, for the benefit of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it had only depended upon herself, the result could certainly have been still better, but we have to be able to live with compromises, and these are important steps that are now being taken to move closer to equality in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to equal conditions at the workplace is a fundamental right and should go without saying. That is unfortunately not the case. The issue is one of human dignity and of avoiding harassment, something with which everyone ought to agree. In spite of this, we know that many women in Europe are at present exposed to sexual harassment on a daily basis. A genuine change in attitude is needed, but also clear and vigorous legislation if we are to create equal opportunities in working life. The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless think it is important to say that equal opportunities for men and women are not in actual fact only a women’s issue. It is an issue that affects us all, irrespective of our gender. Rights are needed which make it possible for both mothers and fathers to combine professional and family life. Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other. My own experience teaches that equality must begin in the home. I sometimes think that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities does not do enough to include us men in its view of equality. I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7. I do not think that the wording goes far enough. Every mother and father must be entitled to return to her or his <span class="italic">own</span> work after parental leave. I emphasise his or her <span class="italic">own</span> work. The wording, <span class="italic">work of equal value</span> is not enough, for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave. Unfortunately, there are many such examples in my own country, too. I should therefore have liked to have seen clearer wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me an additional ten seconds – given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes – and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would <span class="italic">never</span> have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally.</p>

The two amendments that were tabled subsequently by Mrs Hautala have caused a great deal of difficulty, for a large majority of people who are already unhappy about this directive have found in these amendments a reason to vote against a whole host of things. And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained, you should have acted more wisely.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval of the present compromise is far more important than submission of your two additional amendments. I should like to make this clear to you: it was a poor strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">For my second point, I should like to address the Commission. Back in 1993, I drafted a Royal Decree in which I made it compulsory for businesses to draw up an annual report about equal opportunities for men and women in their businesses. That Royal Decree goes beyond what is stated in the present text, since the latter merely encourages them, whereas my piece of legislation was binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have to say, if you want this to yield results, there will need to be consultation with the social partners – much more so than is now the case – and there will need to be agreement with them to apply the provisions of the laws and the directives. For our big problem is not the legislator. He will faithfully transpose what is in the European directives, sometimes too late, but it is done, anyway. Our big problem is the application in the field, and that is in the hands of the social partners. Equal pay and the equal treatment, and whatever else, of women is never a priority for trade unions and employers. In my opinion, the Commission and the Member States would do well to emphasise this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Imagine if one in two men were subject to sexual harassment. Imagine if European men were over-represented in precarious, low-skilled part-time jobs and were given their notice when they told their employers that they intended to have children. Imagine if the proportion of men in Europe’s national parliaments were only 20 per cent. The mind boggles. However, it is women, and not men, who are discriminated against in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">‘A new way of thinking is required in order to solve the problems created by the old way of thinking,’ as Albert Einstein once said. I want to congratulate Mrs Hautala who has worked to find a new way of solving the problems entailed in the EU’s out-of-date Directive on Equal Treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal on which we are to vote tomorrow lays the foundation for clear and effective legislation in the Member States to protect women and men from gender discrimination at work. Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice. What is perhaps most important is Mrs Hautala’s demand that public and private employers in Europe must, in a planned and systematic way, prevent gender discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment. It is no longer enough to react <span class="italic">after</span> the employee has complained. Employers are encouraged to draw up annual equality plans with statistics concerning differences in salaries and the proportion of women and men at different levels and with proposed measures to combat this state of affairs. Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and, especially, to combine work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume that the Council is prepared to approve our proposals. Only then shall we have an instrument for removing the extensive discrimination against women in working life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the amendment to the 1976 directive is a very important move and illustrates the Commission's sensitivity on the question of equal treatment for men and women. For its part, the Committee on Women's Rights, thanks to the sterling efforts of our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and other honourable Members, has helped to produce an improved text today which attracts a broader consensus. That is why we expect it to be warmly supported by both the Commission and the Council. The new directive certainly responds to the change in the situation which has taken place over the last twenty-five years as regards women's employment and vocational training and replaces an outdated legislative framework which has done what it can to combat discrimination against women, serious infringements of the principle of equality, higher unemployment rates, the exclusion of women from numerous professions and the general division of the job market along gender lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform the House that the Greek Parliament recently voted almost unanimously to replace a similar article in the Constitution allowing derogations from the principle of sexual equality on the labour market. The Hautala report suggests a new, better, framework and introduces new types of measures, such as measures to prevent and combat sexual harassment in the workplace, efficient protection for workers from unequal treatment related to pregnancy and maternity, judicial protection, positive measures to apply equality in practice, as other Members have pointed out, and sanctions to punish infringements of the directive. However, I feel that the directive could be clearer in defining purely objective selection criteria for all jobs and should not leave loopholes for gender-based exceptions and exclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It absolutely must update this directive if it is to be an efficient means of achieving these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the directive has been a dogged and, at times, difficult procedure, as happens when we try to adopt a correct, binding and efficient text. Both the rapporteur and all the political groups showed willing, although it was difficult to strike a balance between the ambitious objectives set by the European Union for women's employment and the quality of jobs, the already high <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>on equal treatment for men and women and the exceptional, high-level performance by certain Member States which have gone beyond the proposals for the directive (Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Smet referred to experiences in Greece and Belgium) and the real need to maintain flexibility and the status of female employment during a downswing in the economy and on the labour market, help speed up cooperation with the Council and the European Commission and avoid overburdening the text with important women's issues such as equal pay, which are dealt with elsewhere, and achieve the consensus and majority needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal experience, this procedure has given all of us, European institutions, national governments, social partners and social agencies, a more responsible attitude to women's problems and to the importance of female employment to our development objectives. I think that this mature attitude will also find expression in tomorrow's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The views of my political group have been stated and I share them. Personally, I support Amendment No 17 on the recognition of paternity as a factor in the strategy to promote new working conditions, as a factor in the balanced participation of men and women in family and professional life and as acknowledgement of the social values of family life and support for women in their multiple and simultaneous roles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only disagreement is about how we should achieve this, and there is ultimately the question of how effective individual measures are, or whether such measures just mean more rules and regulations, and extra expenditure and bureaucracy, which we certainly do not need.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not taken all Parliament's demands on board in its common position. Nevertheless, it is true to say that the text of the original proposal has been considerably improved upon. This means that we have taken an important step on the road to updating the Community legislative framework.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a number of issues and problem areas remain to be resolved. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has closely examined all these unresolved questions, and a decision has been reached between the groups not to re-examine all the outstanding demands, but rather the most important. The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has made enormous efforts in order to work out viable compromises. We have the result before us. It emerged from the first reading debate that paternity rights cannot be the same as maternity rights. The compromise accordingly does not affect Member States' freedom to recognise the right to paternity leave within their borders. Both mothers and fathers should have the option of devoting themselves to family duties. This – in contrast to the opinion that we have heard expressed here – is undeniably the stated objective of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the formula whereby a woman on maternity leave should be entitled, after the end of her period of maternity leave, to return to her job or to an equivalent post must be taken on board. However, we have problems with the definition of sexual harassment. We seem to have ended up with a rather woolly form of words here that is not helpful for any judge or other person that has to make a decision on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make one further brief comment opposing the annual reporting arrangements for employers on progress with equal treatment. Bureaucracy alone will not promote equal treatment. We also need to think about small and medium-sized enterprises so that they too accept women looking for jobs.</p>

In actual fact, it is astonishing that we should still be discussing this topic, because we have been discussing it for so long, and virtually everyone is convinced, both men and women, that such equal treatment is fair and does not and should not have to be justified. However, we are not yet that far advanced, unfortunately. To this day, women are being treated as inferior and discriminated against, also in working situations. The combination of work and care still poses problems in many cases. That is why I am pleased with this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that we were able to find a compromise text concerning a number of important points. I therefore hope that the voting tomorrow will be positive so that it can truly represent a step forward in the process of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report encourages States and organisations involved to take measures in favour of equal treatment and to combat sexual intimidation. Better legal protection is given and, for example, opportunities are given to return to work following pregnancy or in connection with adoption. In addition, we will gain a better insight into the actual situation concerning participation of men and women and we shall have access to better, updated statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commission for the initiative. I should also like to thank the rapporteur warmly for all her efforts to persuade us to sing from the same song sheet, but a special thanks goes to all those who have worked hard on this broadly-based text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am aware of your concerns to improve the text of the common position on which there was unanimous agreement in the Council on 11 June 2001. As you know from the first reading, the Commission accepted in spirit the majority of your amendments – 49 amendments of a total of 70 – and consequently drew up an amended proposal which reflected this position.</p>
<p class="contents">In general it should be stressed that the common position considerably enhances the text of the initial proposal and responds to the desire to update the text of Directive 76/207.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now focus on the most essential issues of the directive and make a concerted effort to find possible solutions to improve even further the common position. As you know, the Council only reached an agreement after long discussions on issues such as the precise wording of the definitions and the article on maternity and paternity leave, on which it was very difficult to reach agreement in the Council. The compromise therefore is extremely delicate. On the other hand I feel that the Council could make further compromises in areas such as equality plans, the role of bodies for the promotion of equality and the introduction of preventive measures to combat sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission can accept the following amendments. On Amendments Nos 1 and 5, on preventive measures against sexual harassment the Commission can accept in part the idea of introducing measures for preventing sexual harassment by reformulating the text. Instead of obliging employers to introduce preventive measures, it would be preferable to encourage employers to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 8, on positive measures, the Commission can accept this amendment in part if a definition is contained in the recitals instead of the article of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 9, on provisions in contracts and agreements, the Commission accepts that annulment should be obligatory but rejects the removal of the possibility for amendment of the contract. Here there is the need for flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 13, on the role of the independent budgets, the Commission can accept this amendment in part by reformulating the proposed text. The text of the common position could be improved by strengthening the role of bodies for the promotion of equal treatment and by adding to their tasks the monitoring and follow-up of Community legislation in the field of equal treatment. The Commission can also accept a reformulation of Article 6(3), by expressly mentioning that designated bodies acting on behalf of victims have an interest in ensuring that the provisions of the directive are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 14, on equality plans and the company level, the Commission can accept this idea in part, but with a new formulation for Article 8(b).</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 15, on reporting on positive action measures, the Commission will propose an alternative text so as to report on positive measures only every three years.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 16 on gender mainstreaming, the Commission accepts this amendment partially and in spirit, but only to the extent that it respects the wording of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I should like to turn to those amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission. Amendment No 4, rewording the common position's definition of sexual harassment, in order to take into account Parliament's definition of sexual harassment. Amendments Nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted. The common position was hotly debated in the Council on this issue and a delicate compromise was reached. It is unlikely therefore that any further change would be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I would just like to remind you that there is, of course, the paternity leave directive – the first to be adopted following an agreement between the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not accept Amendment No 11 on group action in cases of discrimination – especially without the consent of the victim of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12, the Commission considers that the content of these amendments is already covered by the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16. It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
