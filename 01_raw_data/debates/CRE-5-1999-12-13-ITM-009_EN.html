<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aparicio Sánchez (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, two years after the negative result of the referendum in Switzerland on its integration into the European Economic Area, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate bilateral agreements with that country in the necessary fields. The draft regulation which has now been submitted for Parliament’s approval complements one of the agreements that has been reached, specifically the one on the transport of goods and passengers by rail and road. In accordance with this agreement, a maximum number of lorries from the Community weighing over 28 tonnes will be authorised to transit Switzerland until 2005, when this country, in aligning itself with Community law, will not require permits for lorries of up to 40 tonnes. </p>
<p class="contents">Thus, as soon as this regulation comes into force, the current situation, which does not allow lorries of more than 28 tonnes to travel through Swiss territory, will end. In 2000, 250 000 permits have been allowed for lorries weighing over 28 tonnes with a full load registered in the European Union. From 2001, permits will be granted for lorries weighing more than 34 tonnes, with free transit for those weighing between 28 and 34 tonnes. This number will rise to 300 000 per year in 2001 and 2002 and to 400 000 per year in 2003 and 2004. On the other hand, lorries allowed to transit empty has been fixed at 220 000 per year. </p>
<p class="contents">The current regulation – which I think is totally correct – proposes a system for the allocation of these permits between the Fifteen Member States. Each one will receive 1500 per year and the rest will be allocated according to current, real or theoretical figures for bilateral traffic and transit traffic. </p>
<p class="contents">I must express my reservations about two negative circumstances. Firstly, the present proposal is being debated and voted on in this House before we know the overall Agreement with Switzerland so we are being asked to approve one part without knowing the whole thing. Secondly, we lack reliable and up-to-date statistics on current flows of goods transport between Switzerland and the European Union even though this study is about to be completed and the same regulation lays down that in 2000, the current allocation figures could be modified if the true figures differ significantly from those that are currently envisaged. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to both of these factors, I think that the desire that this regulation which must be adopted by the codecision procedure should come into force on the same day as the Agreement, is a sufficient argument to explain the need for haste. </p>
<p class="contents">I declare my complete agreement with the basic issue, that is, with the proposed method of calculation for allocating the number of permits to the different Member States and that, given the circumstances, it is the most objective, rigorous and fair method possible. Furthermore, the regulation lays down, as I said, a system for the annual allocation of any permits that have not been allocated. It is to be hoped that in turn, each Member State will allocate the permits that it has been allocated with equally objective criteria to its hauliers. </p>
<p class="contents">By way of a summary, I shall give you some figures. If we apply the proposed system, the distribution of the 1,650 000 permits allowing the circulation of heavy goods vehicles over the five years gives a result of 36% to Germany, 20.5% to Italy, 15.5% to France, 7.8% to the Netherlands, 6.6% to Belgium, 3.8% to Austria with the remaining 10% to be distributed amongst the remaining Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a few amendments put forward by the two Parliamentary Committees that have been debating the draft improve on some details and contribute to the overall fairness of the regulation and to the ease of managing it. I think that it is very important that, as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has decided by means of a vote, we maintain the Commission’s proposed minimum allocation of 1500 permits for each Member State. I must point out that this number is very low, equivalent to two trips per day for each country, and that the total of all these permits to be allocated automatically over five years does not even represent 7% of the total. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall thus end by highlighting once again the overall quality of the draft project. I congratulate the Commission on it and ask the honourable Members to approve this draft regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What are we talking about here? We are not discussing transport policy today; we are discussing the worst aspect of a market economy, quotas. How can we distribute what Switzerland has graciously allotted to us – all because the former Transport Commissioner was careless when he negotiated with the Swiss Minister for Transport on Europe's behalf – how can we share out these concessions amongst the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be aware of this. That is what this is all about. The proposal tabled here by the Commission is actually quite shameful. I should like to make that perfectly clear. Why do we need basic allocations? Do we really want the same to happen with these quotas as we have seen happen with milk for at least the last ten years and for them to become tradable assets? I have already heard countries on the periphery of Europe say today that they will be glad if they can enter into quota-trading. No, of course that cannot be the case! The quotas belong to the European Union and they must also be returned to it. Only the European Union has the right to reallocate them.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it would be better to leave them where they belong – that is, where freight transport really takes place – rather than first scattering them in a happy-go-lucky fashion across all the Member States and then engaging in a laborious process of collecting them in again and reallocating them. We ought to realise that this is not a sensible strategy. I should also like to state quite clearly that overall the rapporteur has certainly produced a very good piece of work, and I should like to thank him for this. However, I have to say that I would have been glad if, given the narrow majority – of one vote – which we had in the committee, the rapporteur and his group had shown a little more willingness to compromise because – and I am saying this quite clearly today – if, when we vote on Wednesday, our Amendment No 7 to reduce the basic allocations to 500 is not passed, we will vote against the whole report. On this point, I would add that if our group, the PPE-DE, had not abstained in the committee we would not be having a debate now. There was a majority against the report. That is why I should like to ask that at long last we be prepared to negotiate on this and not dig our heels in and simply refuse to discuss anything with each other. That is neither in the interests of those who have goods to transport either through or within Switzerland nor is it in the interests of the neighbouring countries. When I consider that 30% of the traffic going through the Brenner Pass alone is traffic diverted from Switzerland, then surely we really must use the quotas here to ensure that the shortest route once again appears an advantage instead of placing an excessive burden on the surrounding countries, a burden which is far greater than any statistics show.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask that the time until midday on Wednesday be used for further discussions on a compromise. I have abandoned the hard line I took in the committee, I have been willing to compromise on this and would be glad if this willingness to compromise were forthcoming from the other side; otherwise we will vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the issues mentioned by Mr Ferber were discussed; we simply reached a different conclusion. Firstly, Mr Ferber, I should like to say quite clearly that this is about transport policy. Of course this is about transport policy. You used the adjective "socialist" here and that is precisely the underlying problem. Thank God the cat is now out of the bag and we know what this is all about. What is happening here is that whenever a sensible policy is pursued, for example in the interests of the environment, it is simply labelled socialist, and the whole thing is thus discredited.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is unacceptable. This is about drafting transport policy. Policy-making means taking decisions about the way in which the market can and should work, but of course under certain basic conditions. This is what has happened here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is about putting in place transitional arrangements. As Mr Sánchez has already said, the transitional rules are a difficult phase in the process, in the course of which we have also tried to keep the Swiss on board. The negotiations were long and hard. I should like to say – not because it is a Commissioner from our side, I have expressed my thanks to enough Commissioners from the other side – that Mr Kinnock conducted tough and prolonged negotiations and that a good result emerged from them. It is a good result, and you also mentioned yourself that this is not about making sure that some countries obtain assets, because if the countries cannot use these assets – as you put it – they go back to the European Commission – to Europe – and then have to be reallocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking also as an Austrian, I would say that this is surely about reducing the amount of traffic transiting France and Austria. This is of course not just traffic which originates in Austria or Germany; it is also traffic which has come, for example, from Greece and other parts of Europe. For this reason I believe that this is a good report. I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Aparicio Sánchez. I also believe that the vote on the report here should be handled in the same way as it was in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not doubt that this is far too strict an interpretation of divine will, and the people of Europe agree. Over the course of many years they have removed many obstacles on the routes between them. This has allowed people to get to know each other, boosted the economy, promoted tourism and given people an opportunity to live together. The conclusion of this Agreement on transport with Switzerland means that after many years a dividing line across Europe will gradually be bridged. This is to be welcomed, in spite of the problems which this process of course also entails. This is good for the general public, who will now no longer, as they did in the past, have to take sometimes extremely long detours on roads which were in any case already congested and for which they also paid handsomely. The new possibilities are also good for the people who live in the Alpine region and for the environment there, which has been seriously damaged by the so-called environmental transit traffic. Of course there were, and still are, sensitive Alpine areas in Austria and France as well, not only in Switzerland, although obviously there are some there too.</p>
<p class="contents">As the process of implementing the Agreement on transport between the EU and Switzerland gets underway, we look forward to it being easier to cross the central Alpine region in the future. We hope that the package of agreements between the European Union and Switzerland will perhaps also lead to Switzerland's becoming a member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, above all we look forward to the proposed regulation making a significant contribution – in the short or long term – to a new, better, more efficient, but also humane and environmentally friendly transport policy in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with this in mind, I should also like to make an appeal in support of Mr Ferber's Amendment No 7. He is proposing to delete – with no replacement – the first sentence of Annex 3, which states that “each Member State shall receive a basic allocation of 1500 permits”. The geography of Europe is not such that each Member State has the same need to pass through Switzerland on the way from A to B. This solution is a bureaucratic nightmare. Let us do away with it!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the statistical evidence on which the proposed distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles is based, the figures to date relating to foreign trade cannot possibly be correct since with the existing 28 tonne limit in Switzerland, long haul road transport, for example from Greece, is just not profitable and is therefore not practised. It is just like distributing visual aids to a group of people, some of whom are blind, according to the amount of printed material they read per annum. Obviously the blind, who would need visual aids more than the others, would get nothing simply because they do not and cannot read.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is not helped by the fact that foreign trade and the use of transport services do not necessarily go hand in hand. For economic reasons, vast quantities of goods are exported in vehicles from other Member States and not from the Member State which produces them. Of course, full liberalisation of the internal transport market makes it virtually impossible to keep tabs on all this. Assessing the needs for transit permits is based on the current traffic flows through the Alpine Region, particularly through Austria, and takes no account of the fact that this traffic flow is largely regulated by the restrictive system of housepoints according to which other allocation quota for Member States have previously been calculated. Mr Aparicio Sánchez obviously took this factor into consideration when drawing up his report, but, as we all know, the figures are only indicative in nature and are based on available existing figures; they do not accurately reflect the reality of the situation. We should not forget either that the proposed changes are transitional in nature since the liberalisation of 40-tonne vehicles will only take effect from 1 January 2005. Furthermore, it seems likely that the EU-Switzerland Agreement will not enter into force before 2001 or even later because of the procedures involved in the relevant areas, in which case the transitional period will be shortened significantly. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aparicio Sánchez has obviously studied the issue carefully using all the above figures and, together with other members of our committee, has come up with some substantial improvements. The return for reallocation of any unused permits by 15 September instead of 15 November as the Commission had proposed, will ultimately reduce the possibility of unfairness in the final distribution, which must be based solely on real needs and will help companies plan their operations better.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work and we should honour him by approving his report. As regards the agreement concerning the report under discussion, and any other agreement with Switzerland for that matter, where will they lead? Perhaps when a final agreement for Switzerland’s accession has been ratified, all this will no longer be an issue to us. Thank you for listening so late in the evening to my maiden speech in this Chamber and I wish you all the best for the new millennium.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following intensive work by the Commission, especially by rapporteur Mr Aparicio Sánchez whose efforts we have cause to be grateful for, we now have the opportunity of obtaining an agreement for heavy goods vehicles, which is extraordinary progress. In the future, it will be a question of achieving more such agreements between the EU and Switzerland, and in connection with other types of vehicle too. However, the agreements on which we can now adopt a position on behalf of the EU concern transit through Switzerland for lorries of 40 metric tons. It could presumably be argued that the fee payable for this kind of vehicle is high. Before the year 2000, it amounts to CHE 180. Clearly, this is expensive, but the cost of instead driving around Switzerland would presumably be a great deal higher. This would also be a considerably worse alternative from an environmental point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there is only one significant weakness in the agreement, namely the allocation of the quotas which have been negotiated and which increase in the course of the years leading up to the agreement’s coming into force. The proposal, which others too have considered, involves a basic quota which is the same for all countries. The only problem is that certain countries have no need of such a large quota while others need access to a significantly larger one. You have only to look at a map of Europe to realise that the flow of traffic from north to south signifies a great deal more for some countries than for others. For countries such as Sweden and Finland, another system of allocation would be extremely significant. Mr Ferber has tabled an amendment which involves our looking in a considerably more flexible way at the present allocation, and I support this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This motion for a resolution aims to establish a method for dividing two types of licences for trucks from the European Union which use the Swiss road network. So this proposal encompasses a regulation and a number of licences, the so-called permits for heavy goods vehicles, and will for the first time offer the opportunity to carry out a prescribed number of journeys on Swiss territory using EU lorries of the maximum permissible weight of 40 tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">The other type of permits, the so-called ‘empty permits’, entitles lorries with a maximum weight of 28 tonnes to a prescribed number of journeys through Switzerland at a reduced toll tariff. </p>
<p class="contents">It gives me pleasure to be able to inform you that the Commission, which holds in high esteem the good work which both parliamentary committees delivered in this field, prepared as they are to compromise, can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Amendment No 8. This means all amendments but one. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commission proposal intends to allocate 90% of the licences to the Member States which account for the lion’s share in Swiss traffic and at the same time, guarantee all Member States a basic quota of 1500 licences annually. The amendment reduces this minimum quota to 500. It is said that the outcome will benefit the quotas of the three major Member States which border Switzerland; to wit France, Germany and Italy. So this would be to the detriment of the other Member States. Since the licensing system contains a mechanism to distribute unused permits across the countries, I can reassure Parliament that there is no risk that permits allocated as part of the basic quota will be wasted or will go unused.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission would prefer it if all Member States were allocated the same minimum quota and, as such, cannot accept Amendment No 7. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
