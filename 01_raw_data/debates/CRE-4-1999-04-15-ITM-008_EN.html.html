<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thors </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report deals as you know with electronic money. Obviously, it is not easy for us to tell today how much this type of money will be used in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we basically have two ways of paying electronically: using ‘smart" cards, onto which we can ‘load" money; or by ‘loading" money onto our computers via various programs and systems which enable us to pay over the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out that these two methods of payment have failed to take off in the manner predicted a few years ago. I hope that we will soon be bold enough to make the necessary great leap forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with many others, I believe that the euro will open up fantastic prospects once it actually exists in physical form. And using the methods I have been describing, we can in practice already make use of the euro now. From the point of view of ordinary people, this lends reality to the new currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, European legislation will be required in this area. Harmonisation is necessary in view of the single market and the fact that, to a large extent, we live in a common currency area. There is no contradiction here with the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The apple of discord when discussing this directive has been whether the holding and issuing of electronic money should be limited to banks. We know that certain Member States sought such a restriction, whereas others did not want there to be any rules at all. I am pleased to see that a large majority in Parliaments Committee on Legal Affairs does not wish to see a restriction on the right to issue. That is the correct approach, in my view; in this way, we can promote the development of new means of payment. Many operators – among them telecommunications companies – are currently bringing new means of payment onto the market. This will mean new possibilities for consumers, and the resulting competition should benefit everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive deals mainly with how the issuers of electronic money are to be supervised and how we can ensure that they are fully viable and liquid. The Committee on Legal Affairs does not have many amendments to put forward here. We did however note with disappointment that the consumer aspects have not been covered in this directive. Parliament has observed on many occasions that consumer concerns have been ignored when the Commission has submitted proposals on financial services. We would seriously urge the Commission actively to monitor the situation with regard to consumer protection and to keep an eye on how the recommendations on the security and reliability of such means of payment are being followed. As soon as possible, we need to see the appropriate measures put in place to protect consumers. It is unfortunately likely to be necessary to introduce further rules governing liability in respect of abuse and breaches of the law in connection with electronic money. A horizontal directive, focusing on more general gaps in regulation in the sector, should be able to remedy the situation, .</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs was broadly united in supporting the proposal that consumers should be entitled to redeem electronic money. I hope that the Commission can go along with this.</p>
<p class="contents">If such money is to become a feature of our everyday lives, we must of course be able to spend it. One way of achieving this is by ensuring that different payment devices and systems can handle all the various cards and programs. That is what is meant by the high‐sounding term ‘interoperability". This can only be achieved if sound business conditions are applied. I myself remain convinced that the sector itself will soon launch a series of measures of its own. The duty of the public authorities is to guarantee the creation of open systems. The Commission can exercise oversight here under its competition powers. We also want the Commission to make sure that any standards produced for this sector do not exclude certain operators. My group cannot, however, support the proposals in Amendments Nos 12 and 13, which call for separate directives in order to safeguard interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also point out that we have tabled a number of technical amendments which we hope will clarify the scope of the directive, making it easier in future to amend the legislation.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, on her report and to welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights has taken on board nearly all the proposals of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in its report. This means that I do not have to repeat many of the points the committee made, as they have already been dealt with, and I will therefore use my speaking time to stress some of the problems we face, which are a matter of great concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the problem of interoperability. We think it is extremely important to have an interoperable system of using electronic money between different countries, but this interoperability involves having a card that everyone accepts. Mrs Thors and I have been informed that the CIP very recently reached agreement on a card, but we were also told, during a hearing that we organised, that it could take 18 months before this type of card comes into use.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, Commissioner, we on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs think that the various forms of electronic money are of vital importance for implementing the euro as quickly as possible before the coins and notes come into circulation. This could be either in the form of virtual money stored on computers for electronic commerce or in the form of interoperable cards. This 18 month lead‐time will yet again delay an opportunity for the public to use the euro, which seems rather worrying to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We also find it rather worrying that each country has its own inter‐bank system so that there is no internal market in banking systems. Similarly, we are concerned that payments effected within the internal market are treated as international payments, with all the costs that implies. We have therefore made some proposals on this subject, namely Amendments Nos 12 and 13, which Mrs Thors has already referred to. We have tabled these amendments because we consider it essential, Commissioner, for the Commission to bring forward draft directives on this subject, so that there is a set of regulations which everyone recognises and which provides a guarantee for every citizen in Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oddy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, for her excellent report on an important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">This report should be seen in conjuction with Mr Ullmann's report on electronic signatures and my own report, which will come up next month, on electronic commerce. The Internet and methods of working electronically are a way forward for the world and the European Union. This is a growth area and should create a large number of jobs. At a briefing yesterday, Commissioner Flynn said there were around 100 000 job vacancies in the European Union in this area. It is important that we get sensible rules that will encourage growth of the Internet and electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic money is not used very much at present, but I am sure that it will become very important in the future. The basis of Mrs Thors' report will encourage this growth. We need to ensure that we establish rules at European level that encourage the use of computers and do not stifle economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur. I shall be supporting her report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wolf </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, this issue always seems to create confusion. Because the electronic world is unfamiliar, we imagine that this is all about some sort of virtual money. There is no such thing. What we are really dealing with here is a new way of undertaking and recording credit transactions. Like the <span class="italic">assignat</span> in revolutionary France, which marked the introduction of credit money, electronic money has brought new forms of fraud and new ways for governments to circumvent budgetary restrictions. We really must find common rules. It is perhaps important to point out that this must not be taken as a pretext for returning to a type of situation in which private trading houses control the money supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In the high middle ages, one of the main instruments that was used to promote economic development throughout Europe and to overcome the problems connected with private money was the introduction of silver coinage, guaranteed by the monarch. By the same token, I believe there are three demands to be made, and indeed they are made in the report: universality must mean interoperability, redeemability and free use. Money can be made from the related financial services. All of this must be organised in the euro framework; it must not be based on the harsh terrain within which the banking and financial services sector still operates.</p>
<p class="contents">If that condition is met, important avenues will open up here, and they must be pursued. But we do need to cast off the Klondike mentality which sees electronic operations as the key to a great financial boom, just as the <span class="italic">assignat</span> was expected to be. The outward token of credit is not a collateral loan. Merely promising to honour a loan is not honouring the promise, which is something that has to take place in the future. That is why the whole area of the prudential supervision of issuing companies is actually a key element without which the realm of electronic money cannot develop in an accountable way. I should also like to remind the House of our urgent need to act in the field of banking supervision too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Thors on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and Mr Torres Marques on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. They have made an extremely valuable contribution to the review of these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the issuance of electronic money is just one element in the far broader context of electronic commerce systems and, within those systems, electronic payments themselves. The Commission thinks it right to tackle the horizontal issues common to this broader context with horizontal instruments and measures, rather than applying restricted solutions limited to just one service.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for directives that we are discussing in fact relate to a specific aspect which has its own special features, requiring a targeted legislative response. By this I mean the problem – and it alone is the problem – of the minimum prudential rules which, by ensuring that electronic currency institutions are stable and sound, will open the way to mutual recognition of authorisations and controls, and hence genuine free movement of operators and services. You will know that traditional credit institutions are already themselves authorised to issue electronic money, in accordance with the whole array of banking directives, and this new service of theirs may therefore make use of the European passport.</p>
<p class="contents">These two proposals are designed to open up to other operators, within a neutral competitive framework, the new market for the issuance of electronic money, taking into account both the concern to see proper competition develop in the sector and the situation as it currently exists in a number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is largely positive in its assessment of the two proposals and includes amendments which improve their clarity. It is a view that I welcome and for which I am grateful. But I do not think that two other different issues – which I consider to be extremely sensitive – can usefully be tackled in this directive, namely the concerns voiced in the report in relation to interoperability and redemption of the stored money.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the Commission is already looking at these important issues within a broader framework and has undertaken to deal with them appropriately, including, among other things, all the expectations relating to bearer protection. And so although we are today unable to accept the amendments in this area, this is only because the Commission does not consider the two proposals under discussion to be the appropriate context. Nonetheless, we agree with the analyses of the problems that will have to be resolved in the appropriate context and manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention briefly the individual amendments. The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 14, 20, 21 and 22 to the proposal for a directive on the electronic money institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 asks the Commission to draw up a specific directive on the contractual relationship between issuers and bearers of electronic money. As the House will be aware, in 1997 the Commission adopted a recommendation in this regard and we are now looking at its application: it would therefore be premature to undertake to adopt a proposal for a directive at this juncture, as the situation cannot be properly assessed until the current review is completed. That is why we are unable to accept the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4 to 13, with the exception of Amendment No 10, concern the problems linked to the payments system, in particular the existence and administration of inter‐bank systems, interoperability and access to them. As I have said, these issues are being dealt with horizontally, within a more comprehensive framework, as part of other work in which the Commission is engaged, and we therefore cannot agree to these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar considerations apply to Amendments Nos 10, 18 and 19 to the proposal for a directive on the electronic money institutions, and Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to the other directive. They relate to the problem of redeeming stored electronic money. This problem is also being tackled as part of the review of the application of the recommendation on the relationship between issuers and bearers. Furthermore, the Commission has already undertaken to monitor consistently all the problems concerning bearer protection in relation to electronic money, and these problems naturally extend further than the issue of redemption alone. I must repeat that the Commission is very sensitive to these aspects and open to many of the solutions set out in the amendments, but we do not believe the approach and the legislative instrument used to be appropriate, and therefore feel that we cannot accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with what is proposed in Amendment No 15, but has to enter a reservation with regard to its exact wording and the order of the individual paragraphs. Amendment No 16 is also acceptable, but it is helpful to place the adverb ‘only" before ‘references", so as to avoid creating confusion with references contained in other instruments. That, I believe is the intention of the author of the amendment. Clearly, the Commission accepts Amendment No 17 in that same perspective. It also accepts Amendment No 23, except for the second paragraph; this cannot technically be deleted because in the event of derogation from the first and second banking directives, neither the competent authorities nor the own funds would any longer be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Mr President, by again expressing my sincere thanks for the broadly favourable report that has been presented and for having been given this opportunity of explaining the Commission"s views on the amendments which we are unable to accept but which it will, I hope, be possible to reconsider in the light of what I have said.</p>
