<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am very pleased to be opening the debate. I am drawn to speak before my co-rapporteur merely by reason of being first in the alphabet and not of seniority in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I very much enjoyed working on the report with Manuel Medina. I first became engaged in the whole project of the human resources reform in the Commission at the end of 1999 when I was first appointed provisional rapporteur – and subsequently confirmed as rapporteur – for Parliament on the overall strategy. For me, tonight will hopefully be the major culmination of the process. I do not believe we will have further debates like this – I see the Commissioner is enthusiastically agreeing with me. That does not mean to say, however, that this Parliament will not be continuing to take a keen interest in the whole process of the reforms because the regulations themselves have to provide the right framework in which the reforms are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to thank colleagues here tonight from the various committees involved. We may not have accepted all their proposals but I want to assure them that we have considered everything very thoroughly indeed and we want to thank them for their contribution and for working with us.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we have put before you tonight, colleagues, contains 55 proposed amendments to the regulation package. That may sound like a lot, but when you look at the size and complexity of this package you will see that we have actually concentrated on improving and clarifying the basic provisions of the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one important new principle which I will come to later, but the real point I want to make to colleagues tonight is that our role has been to check methodically that the regulations deliver the reforms that you supported strongly when I presented my report to this House in 2001. That has been the central part of our task. It has not been our task to attempt a re-negotiation of fundamental parts of the package. The Commissioner has spent enough time and has had enough trouble dealing with that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Our job has been to look at the politics and the strategy. You will see that we are basically satisfied that this framework of Staff Regulations will deliver the core parts of the reform: the move to a personnel system where members of staff in all the European institutions will be properly compensated, will be able to exploit their talents and encouraged to progress their careers in a system that rewards their efforts. That has meant a new grading structure and a new appraisal system. They are absolutely crucial and we have not sought in any way to alter that part of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In these reforms across the institutions we also introduce a new category of contract staff. Again, that is an area we have not sought to change. In the areas we have looked at, we have done so very much in consultation with other institutions, because it is important to understand that these regulations apply all across the European institutions. Part of our job as the rapporteur team has been to consult staff and executives in other institutions to make sure their needs are fully catered for.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing more flexibility where institutions want to use it in the grading structure, particularly to retain staff with linguistic duties and specific positions where institutions feel that contract staff may not be appropriate. Tonight I should like to point out specifically the important task of Parliamentary ushers.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the new principles? My colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, will say more about this, but the major new point of principle is to propose to you that the existing pension system in today's world ought to be simplified by removing the current weighting system that is based on a pensioner's final place of residence. In contemporary society and with more mobility we really ought to be contemplating a simpler, less bureaucratic system. We are not at all convinced that the present system can be fully justified in today's world. I know there are a lot of discussions going on about the pension system at the moment and the Commissioner may, indeed, refer to that later.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by referring to the politics of the current situation going forward. We are very conscious, in this House, that the Commissioner is engaged in a major negotiation with Council. We are only here as an advisory Chamber, but colleagues expect us to press the Parliament's point of view as far as we possibly can. We are following the negotiations in Council very closely and we know that pension issues are very important there.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be recommending to colleagues in the House tomorrow that they approve all the amendments, but that we should withhold our vote on the final legislative resolution until such time as we are satisfied that the Commissioner has achieved all he is setting out to achieve. Also, with the oral question that we have tabled for the House tonight, we are asking the Commissioner to come back to this House with the results of the final proposal so that we can ensure he delivers what we are all looking for: the optimum framework to carry the European institutions forward in this current century with an optimum personnel policy for the independent and quality staff we are looking for across the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Harbour for his kind words. I think we have worked together to the very best of our abilities in producing this report. We come from different countries, from different political backgrounds and have different sensibilities. This allowed us to approach the issue with a certain degree of impartiality.</p>
<p class="contents">The work done by Commissioner Kinnock gave us a starting point. His work included a number of fairly well-balanced proposals seeking to make administration more flexible, to encourage the appointment of good staff and promotion on the basis of merits and qualifications. It was a good basis on which to build.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteurs, we had the opportunity to interview staff representatives and representatives of the institutions. We found the Commission had done good work. In my opinion, this is a good and well thought-out package. It could fully meet the needs of European Union civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the attention of the House to the quality of the work of the civil servants of the European Union. At present, we have 25 000 civil servants who administer a substantial budget on behalf of a Community of 15 countries and a population of 380 million people. The European Union has significantly fewer civil servants than a large city would have, even though the EU budget is probably considerably larger. I feel the European Union civil servants do a sterling job. I do not want to introduce any regulations that would prejudice them or create situations that would lead to labour disputes. Like Mr Harbour, I would like to draw your attention to certain statements made by the Council that appear to seek a penny-pinching cutback in the pension plan, in complete contradiction to proposals forwarded to us by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I believe the amendments Mr Harbour referred to are reasonable and necessary. He made special mention of the correction coefficients amendment. It makes no sense that when staff retire from working for a European Union institution, they can choose to live in any country, but the value of their pension depends on what country they chose to live in. Like any other administration, the European Union must pay all civil servants the same level of pension. It must allow civil servants to be able to select the country they wish to live in permanently. They may wish to live in a cooler place, a hotter place, somewhere cheaper or somewhere more expensive. We must however ensure they have a free choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention another clause I feel is quite important. The staff regulations contained an anachronistic rule, similar to an ecclesiastical <span class="italic">nihil obstat</span>. This rule stipulated that civil servants could not publish a piece of work without the approval of their superiors. In my opinion, we now live in a society which is sufficiently free and civil servants are sufficiently responsible for this rule to be dispensed with. Civil servants understand what they can write. If they were to publish something that damaged the institutions, we would be able to assess whether it was against the law or merely comments they were free to make. We should not introduce preventative censure measures. Furthermore, I think it would be impossible to implement them. I cannot see Commission civil servants reading the works of more junior members of staff dealing with subjects as banal as the structure of the Commission or the structure of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also includes proposals to modify the regulations for people of a different sexual orientation, namely gay men and lesbians. We have sought to prevent civil servants of a different sexual orientation from being denied cohabitation benefits because of their sexual orientation and as a consequence of very strict legal criteria. To this end, we have endeavoured to find a flexible formula.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe the proposals we have put forward are balanced. I believe Parliament should have no difficulty in approving them. I think both the Commission and the Council should recognise that they represent Parliament’s wish to collaborate. I therefore hope that the Council in particular will approve the package, taking account of the amendments we propose.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention, Mr President. I trust that tomorrow’s comments on the subject of the oral question will help to clarify the situation with regard to this threat to the pension plan for European Union civil servants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do this in all sincerity and not just because it is my duty to do so. They have managed to achieve a wide consensus on a subject that is clearly onerous, difficult and complex. I would also like to thank the committee for the effort they have made in negotiations and in reaching an understanding that has resulted in this positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Member Mr Corbett, who was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been kind enough to let me speak in his place. This shows the extent to which members of this committee worked in harmony with each other: a member of one particular group is prepared to allow a member of another group to replace him. We all understood that the task was to amend the Commission’s proposal in order to make it more effective. The two rapporteurs have just explained some of these amendments. I would like to refer to one of these amendments which I believe to be very important for Parliament and for the other European institutions. The amendment distinguishes between an institution supporting decisions regarding staff and the decisions themselves. The latter have to be made by each of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the elimination of correction coefficients for pensions, I agree with what the two rapporteurs said. I would like to make one further comment. Those who have made equal contributions during their working life as civil servants have the right to equal pensions when they retire.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is how the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has contributed to the report. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of the report. We are convinced it represents an improvement on the Commission’s proposal and that it will make the already excellent European civil service even more dynamic and efficient. Indeed, this is the aim of the reforms. I would like to echo the previous speaker’s praise of the civil service. It is ready to incorporate the know-how of civil servants from the ten countries who will become members of the European Union next month. In this process of reunification, the European Union will practically double in size and its population will increase by a third. A large number of new civil servants from different cultures will have to be incorporated into the complex system and its administrative procedures. The new civil servants will need to assimilate to the culture of the European civil service.</p>
<p class="contents">I think therefore we were right not to introduce a radical reform but rather a gradual one. This reform allows the most antiquated concepts to be eliminated. At the same time, it allows new civil servants to benefit from the wealth of experience of current civil servants who have served the European Union for many years. These are the staff who have ensured that the European Union is more than a mere alliance or a group of countries. They have ensured that the Union has brought peace to many and a whole host of benefits to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to this work, the draft regulations drawn up by you, Commissioner, now constitute, together with the amendments which I hope you will accept, a balanced whole which should give the staff of our institutions regulations which bring together both tradition and modernity.</p>
<p class="contents">Tradition is important, because we are very attached to the idea of preserving the great principles of a civil service which is independent of lobbies or other influences, a civil service which is competent and is recruited through objective and rigorous competitions, and a civil service which has rights and duties that are absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in favour of modernity, however. After more than thirty years of good and loyal service, the staff regulations for the European Civil Service were in need of serious reform. Having said that, every innovation has to be assessed in the light of the objectives being sought. For example, the use of a new category of staff, namely contract staff, however useful it may be, must not lead to the abuse of this formula, because that would run the risk of weakening recruitment conditions and would undermine the workings of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, although we can congratulate ourselves on the equilibrium that we have succeeded in reaching, it is still important that the Council should not disrupt this fragile equilibrium. My concern follows the Council’s reactions, in particular, to two important questions which are marginal to the regulations but which the Council wants to add to them in order to make an overall package. These two questions are, on the one hand, the multi-annual salary adaptation method and, on the other hand, and most important, the pension scheme. On this last point we are rather concerned, Commissioner, because we are seeing the Council link the adoption of the regulations to the adoption of a new pension scheme, whereas you yourself have not yet said anything precise about pensions, and we know how explosive this issue is.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why several groups, including ours, have tabled an oral question about pensions, so that you can give us the information that we need before we give the definitive green light to the reform of the staff regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Neil,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to join the House on this debate on the report on the staff regulations, not only because it is always an honour to speak in this House but also because when there has been a very extended period of consideration and so many meetings, a certain family feeling develops. I am very pleased, therefore, to join so many friends tonight who have been my partners in discussion for what seems like an extremely long time. It was, however, a very worthwhile experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by expressing my very deep gratitude to the rapporteurs, Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega for their very thorough, thoughtful and constructive work on this important issue of the reform of the staff regulations. I also pay tribute to the intensive efforts undertaken by the other members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and to the opinion-giving committees and their draftspersons. Very substantial work has been done in this House by everyone concerned. I know that the staff of the institutions will recognise the fact that serious and committed attention has been given by Parliament to their statute, their employment conditions and their future.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it will assist the House if I begin by referring to the issues raised in the oral question tabled by four political groups in the House. I was naturally going to highlight several pension issues in my statement this evening. I therefore welcome the questions because they give me the first opportunity since last Wednesday's General Affairs Council to focus explicitly and publicly on those matters. Responding to the question may mean that I take a little more time than was originally anticipated. I hope that in a good cause you will bear with me.</p>
<p class="contents">To help to ensure clarity I should like to ask the House to refer to the draft guidelines that were adopted without change as the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003. That document has been circulated. I regret that it is only in French and English at this juncture. If honourable Members look at Paragraph B of those conclusions they will see that the Council instructed Coreper to prepare a more detailed position, ‘on the issue of adaptation of the pension system’. If Members then turn to Paragraph D, they will see that the Council called on the Commission to ‘table by April 2003 a detailed, technical working document setting out a proposal to guarantee actuarial balance as from 1 January 2004’.</p>
<p class="contents">Examination of those paragraphs will show that the only request to the Commission was for a proposal for the methodology for a study which would then facilitate calculation of the contributions required to ensure actuarial balance in the pension system. Therefore there was no request to the Commission to submit, in the words of the question, a detailed document that includes a change in the pension scheme. Obviously, the Commission will not be producing such a document at any stage. We have never produced such a document and we are not going to do it now.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving and maintaining an actuarial balance is clearly a somewhat different issue. As honourable Members will know, this has always been the obligation under the present Article 83(4) of the Staff Regulations, even though the requirement has not been made consistently operational. The Commission's proposal on modernisation of the staff regulations has always, therefore, included a commitment to ensure actuarial balance. Of course, the issue was discussed and negotiated in detail with the trade unions and in the interinstitutional staff regulations committee well before the Commission proposal went to the Council and came to this House last year.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there is nothing new about the Commission's commitment to secure actuarial balance. There is nothing that has not been fully debated and assessed. There is nothing that was not made known and made clear to Parliament and the members of the EU civil service and their staff representatives. All that the reference in the General Affairs Council conclusions relates to is the need for an up-to-date actuarial study that will enable the Council and the EU civil service to know, well before 1 January 2004, exactly what the contribution rates by Member States and by staff will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the instruction to Coreper in the General Affairs Council conclusions is to provide a more detailed position on adaptation of the pension system that, in the words of the conclusions, is more consistent with the trends prevailing in Member States. That in itself is not surprising since it is obvious that demographic changes, the Lisbon strategy and indeed the policy approach of the Commission and of this House to so-called 'active ageing' will always ensure that Member State governments give attention to issues of retirement and pensions. That reality has in fact ensured that several Member State delegations have put forward a paper on pension parameters for the European Union civil service, and it is being considered by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Our response has been to point out that whilst we recognise the need to ensure consistency with the social and economic policy on employment and ageing which we, in the Commission, advocate, we also emphatically require proper account to be taken of some basic facts about the employment age profile of the European Union civil service, which are of great relevance to any consideration of pension parameters.</p>
<p class="contents">Those facts are, in brief: first that that average starting age of employment in the EU civil service is 32 years and 34 years for policy grade officials. Any calculations that made a full pension dependant on more than 35 years of employment and payments would consequently be entirely unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is the fact that, as your rapporteurs point out, whilst the official pensionable age in the EU civil service is relatively low at 60 years, the average real retirement age of 63.1 years is about three years later than the average retirement age in Member States and one year later than in the Member State with the highest average retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects therefore, we are implementing a core policy of the Lisbon Strategy and we have been doing so for several decades. Against that background and in the context of actuarial balance, the Commission has, in the course of negotiations, indicated some willingness to consider a degree of possible modification of the formal pensionable age. I should like to emphasise that there has been absolutely no conclusion of any kind on that point, or indeed on the other points.</p>
<p class="contents">In this and in all other matters we have strongly emphasised the need to ensure that the acquired rights and legitimate expectations of present staff are properly respected. That clearly manifests our position. It answers the first question in the oral question. For reasons of emphasis I repeat that any discussion of any potential changes would have to fulfil that requirement on acquired rights and legitimate expectations. Increased understanding of those facts induced the Council to ask Coreper to go away and, as the conclusions of the Council show, prepare a more detailed position by the April General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition and to complete the picture, the GAC conclusions include Paragraph C that proposes further discussions on the weightings that are currently applied to EU civil service pensions in different Member States. I know that there are a number of amendments before the House relating to these weightings. The issue is a source of general concern in this House and indeed in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are in negotiations, the Commission can only say at this juncture that we hear those concerns and while we may not support the amendments that have so far been offered, we are aware of the need to deal with this matter within the overall balance of the negotiated final package.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate that in this context, as well as in the wider spheres of reform, the Commission will at all times actively seek to uphold the accumulated rights and legitimate expectations of current staff. That is a principle that we uphold and it is one that is understood by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also emphasise that we are conducting the negotiations on the basis of the fundamental principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Any decision on any issue would be subject to reaching an agreement that is mutually satisfactory in overall terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that we are engaged in complex and sometimes necessarily delicate negotiations; we are not engaged in polemical exchanges. We have confidence in the strength and the realism of our arguments and of our arithmetic. We will continue to strive to ensure that our partners in negotiation in the Council will accept both the arguments and the arithmetic. That, obviously, is our sustained and unchanging objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that I have had to take time to give a detailed response on the important question put by honourable Members. I think you will understand that I wanted to give full answers to the questions on this important issue of pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the fact that the report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before this House for debate reiterates strong support, as we have heard from the rapporteurs, for the overall reform package and does so in serious, practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I welcome the realistic commitment to the importance of maintaining competitive levels of pay and pensions; a commitment to the introduction of what has become known in shorthand as a promotion guarantee on a collective basis – and I emphasise <span class="italic">a collective basis</span>; and a commitment to the inclusion in the staff regulations of 'the method' as the rational, economical and stable means for adjusting pay and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am pleased to say that the guidelines adopted by the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003 echo many of the principles stated by Messrs Harbour and Medina Ortega in their explanatory statement and they are equally reflected in numerous amendments before us today. In particular, the guidelines in the Council conclusions – Paragraphs E, F and G respectively – express support for the broad pay and allowances proposals as a good basis, support the transitional arrangements for the new career system and express an openness towards the inclusion, on a finite basis, of the 'the method' in the Staff Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the amendments, I will first list the many that the Commission can readily support. Indeed, I will summarise them because I do not want to test the patience of the House. Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9 and 48 on the strengthening of interinstitutional cooperation; Amendment No 20 on whistleblowing, Amendments Nos 12 and 14; Amendment No 13 on the opening of the assistant 1 to assistant 3 career bracket for specific duties including the duties of parliamentary ushers; Amendments Nos 9, 25, 48, 50 and 51 tabled by the rapporteurs relating to the status of the staff of the political groups – this means of course that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 32 and 60 which go well beyond the position set out wisely by the rapporteurs; Amendment No 17 on sexual harassment, we can accept; Amendment No 18, Amendment No 19, Amendments Nos 33, 34 and 35 on staff absences; Amendments Nos 42, 43 and 44 on disciplinary procedures; Amendment No 38 on the duration of the membership of the joint advisory committee for professional incompetence – that does not mean that it is in favour of incompetence, of course – it should be the joint advisory committee on professional incompetence.</p>
<p class="contents">There is second group of amendments on which the Commission is prepared to maintain an open mind during negotiations on the overall package or to accept some of the amendments, at least in part. The Commission cannot at this juncture give a positive response to amendments on weighted pensions. However, as I said, we are of course conscious of the widespread political concerns relating to pension coefficients and of the need to deal with the matter within the overall balance of the total package.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to accept Amendments Nos 52 and 54 on the limitation of levels of function of contract agents and on the duration of those contracts; Amendments Nos 14, 15, 26, 29 and 30 relate to central provisions in the context of a new career system, Article 5(3) on the criteria for appointments to the administrator and assistant function groups; Article 31 on the organisation of competitions for higher grades, including middle management grades, and Article 45 on the certification procedure for transfers from assistant to administrative function groups. All of these Articles have, I am glad to say, been subject to intense discussions in Council and Coreper. The compromises reached as recently as last week will be seen to reflect many, if not all, of the objectives aimed at by Members of this House in their amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 31 now allows for the organisation of competitions, for instance, at administrator grades 9, 10, 11 or, on an exceptional basis, 12. Remembering that administrator grade 12 will correspond to a higher level than today's grade A4, the total number of candidates appointed to vacant posts at these grades will not exceed 20% of the total number of the appointments by external recruitment to the administrator function group in any one year. That compromise goes further than the outcome sought, for example, by Amendment No 26.</p>
<p class="contents">On the certification procedure, Article 45a now makes provision, in Paragraph 2, for the European Personnel Selection Office to determine the contents of all examinations organised by the institutions in order to ensure that the basic requirements of a transfer are met in a harmonised and consistent manner. That should make Amendment No 30 redundant. On Amendments Nos 58 and 59 on Members' assistants, this House knows the Commission has been and always will be very aware and sympathetic to the concerns about this issue in Parliament. Honourable Members will however be aware that of course several Member States do not share our joint enthusiasm and there is much work to be done independently of the negotiations on the staff statute.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 71 to 74 inclusive, on the recruitment of third country nationals with a permanent right of residence, the Commission is aware that there is a discussion amongst political groups about the possibility of finding a compromise arrangement on this issue which is of concern to many honourable Members. While sympathetic, the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments as they are currently formulated and therefore I have to reserve my position on this question for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I am grateful for the patience of the House, there are inevitably some amendments which the Commission cannot accept because they would tend to detract from the overall proposal. I will just pick a few, by no means an exhaustive list, but I must say it is outweighed by the number of amendments that we are readily accepting. We cannot accept Amendment No 16, Amendments Nos 14, 15, 26, 29, 30 and 75 – for the reason that I mentioned earlier, i.e. that they are unnecessary because of positive developments in Council on these questions; Amendments Nos 53, 55 and 76 on contract agents – because, as I said earlier, the Commission supports Amendments Nos 52 and 54 from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; Amendment No 32 on the extension of Article 50 to administrator grade 12 – we do not think that would be appropriate; Amendment No 63 on sexual harassment where the Commission supports the text put by the rapporteurs in Amendment No 17, and finally Amendment No 64 on the expatriation allowance, for the very direct reason that the Commission retains the view that the allowance for staff who are expatriate workers is objectively justified and indeed objectively necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, we have from the outset been committed to providing reforms in the Staff Regulations which would facilitate radical modernisation whilst upholding the current conditions of employment and improving the career development of members of the European Union civil service. The reasons for that are, I hope, recognised to be practical and justified and not insular or conservative.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a direct connection between reform, motivation and necessary material security. It is both realistic and relevant to acknowledge and to provide for that. This very substantial report from honourable Members recognises that practical reality and is a significant step towards the fulfilment of our commitments. I warmly thank all who have been engaged in the compilation of Parliament's view and I very much look forward to the adoption of the report in the House tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also share Commissioner Kinnock’s opinion that we have become used to working together and that very special links have been created.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking now, however, as the spokesperson for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and, as such, I welcome the Commission’s assurances regarding the cost of reforming the staff regulations of the European Civil Service. If the working hypotheses are confirmed, the reform as a whole will be of limited cost to the Union’s budget and it ought, in any case, to be possible to finance it in the context of the current financial perspective. This is absolutely essential and I should therefore like to give Commissioner Kinnock full marks on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">This initial finding leads me to make a few additional comments, however. First of all, insofar as the reform package negotiated with the unions observes the principle of rigour, it seems to me that there is no need for the Council to demand that rights acquired by civil servants in relation to pensions should suddenly be called into question. The need to make savings on pensions is not urgent, and if the Council really wants to find ways of making savings, it should quite simply and quickly approve our proposals regarding the staff regulations of our parliamentary assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think that pensions should not be a taboo subject. Improvements are possible and it seems to me, for example, that there is no longer any case for continuing to use the correction coefficients. I would also have liked to see mechanisms put in place to ensure the long-term viability of the current pensions system, precisely because we must protect civil servants’ interests. This cannot be done, however, without acting gradually, over a period of time, and above all in a spirit of consultation and dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and finally, on a broader level we must not lose sight of the objectives of this reform, which led us to encourage reform in general and the reform of the staff regulations in particular. It is – and always should be – a question of improving the efficaciency and the performance of the European institutions in the service of the Union. It is in the light of those objectives that we shall evaluate the appropriateness of each measure and judge the success of the reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And although this administration is expanding continually and taking on new duties, the necessary adjustments have not yet been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Its staffing regulations are in need of reform now more than ever if we are to successfully modernise its personnel policy. We all know that technological progress has invalidated traditional staffing structures, as the private sector realised some time ago. We likewise know that the European Union is promoting a series of policies, such as measures to improve employment standards, combat discrimination, reconcile working and family life and introduce flexible employment. It would be strange if it failed to incorporate all the policies which it promotes for European society and European businesses in its own bureaucratic mechanism and if it failed to set an example for a new public administration standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is short and I should therefore like to focus in my speech on three amendments. The first concerns the adoption of an amendment introducing a weighting into pension calculations, regardless of the pensioner's place of residence. The Commission proposal to introduce a weighting to adjust pensions to the purchasing power in the pensioner's place of residence runs counter to the Community principle of equality and the right of free establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the amendment by our group to secure a climate of peace within the institutions' administrative services. It is important to emphasise that, in the new working world which is emerging, safeguarding mutual trust on all sides is the key to increasing productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that we should vote in favour of adopting the amendment by our group changing contracts of fixed duration to contracts of indefinite duration where five-year contracts are renewed for a further five years. I think that this, in conjunction with recruitment of contractual agents, will allow us to achieve flexibility with the required degree of protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wanted to ensure that the ELDR voice was heard tonight, heard to congratulate our rapporteurs and the Commissioner and to say that we very much support the work that is being done in this reform process. It is a recognition that we are moving towards a modern civil service for Europe and a proper career structure for those who work in it.</p>
<p class="contents">There perhaps has to be a certain irony that we, as legislators, spend much of our time demanding change and modernisation of those we legislate for. Now are putting our own House in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not rehearse all the many good things that other speakers have referred to that rightly find their place in the Regulations. But I would like to say something about the pension question. I am grateful to the Commissioner for his very long and worthy answer to the oral question, and I would like to underline what he said. Acquired rights and legitimate expectations of existing staff must be paramount and that must be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">The other matter to which I would like to draw attention – and I am sorry that it seems that, whilst there is sympathy, it will not find full recognition – is that of the position of our parliamentary assistants. Amendments Nos 58 and 59 are there to try to regularise and give status to those who serve us as individual MEPs. This is something that is long overdue and has to find its place, eventually, in the mechanisms and workings of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just imagine: 25 000 people manage this unlikely continent which invents a new future for itself every day. It is a tremendous task and at the moment it is being performed to perfection. Thank you, therefore, to the civil servants who support us.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, Commissioner, contains interesting and balanced elements, particularly after the amendments proposed by Parliament. They are appropriate in order to make the European Civil Service more dynamic. I shall not repeat what some other Members have said, better than I could. I shall concentrate on Amendments Nos 58 and 59 which would enable us to treat parliamentary assistants as contract staff of the Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments are very positive. They were tabled – and at this point I shall address the Council bench so that it can take note – by the five major groups in the House. Consequently, before the Council waves them away with a flick of its somewhat disdainful hand, I invite it to take a closer look at them. If the Council needs a moment to reflect, that will in no way detract from its responsibilities towards the European Parliament with regard to the Gillig report, a report on the same subject which has been awaiting attention for too long. That report made it possible to amend a rule so as to give our assistants the option of choosing their national social insurance cover. The fact that the Council has not yet reacted shows a lack of respect for the agreement which it concluded with Parliament, and in legal terms it places it in an utterly impossible position.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Vice-President responsible for this matter, whose patience, I can assure you, is pretty well exhausted, if this blocking tactic persists, I shall be obliged to condemn publicly and vigorously the nature of the blocking and those who are responsible for it. If that were to happen, it is by no means certain that certain Member States who pretend to be ardent supporters of social policy and transparency will emerge with their pretensions increased or even intact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have achieved a large degree of consensus which seemed impossible just a few months ago. It is also important to mark the importance of this item of legislation. It is in legislative terms the second and final major tranche of the Commission reform programme, so when the Council adopts this proposal all the essential building blocks will be in place for making sure the Commission becomes more efficient and more effective than it has ever been.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows, I would have liked this proposal to go further in some respects. For instance the expatriation allowance he referred to. This is an anachronism in a Europe in which we have a labour market where people can move freely from one country to another. So we will support the amendments tabled by the Verts/ALE Group on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the pensions issue where, frankly, the hysterical reaction from some of the trade unions masks the fact that something does need to be done to bring the pension system into line with the outside world. I support the package as a whole because it will mean major improvements to the way the Commission works.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to focus on the one specific issue previous speakers have already addressed, which is the question of parliamentary assistants. The Commissioner also referred to it. It is very sad that, so far, this House has been unable to ensure that all parliamentary assistants are properly paid and have adequate social security cover. A survey by the Assistants' Association concluded that a number of years ago 53% of assistants had no medical cover, 46% were not insured against accidents in the workplace and 53% had no travel insurance while on mission.</p>
<p class="contents">The political groups have now tabled a joint amendment which could help us break the deadlock. We are proposing that parliamentary assistants should become contract staff in the sense of the Staff Regulations, while leaving the detailed rules to the European Parliament. This would provide a solid basis for a solution that would be acceptable to all and finally end the uncertainty the assistants currently face.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope the Commission will back our amendment, despite what the Commissioner just said, and help us convince the Council that something must be done. Parliamentary assistants must no longer be treated as second-rate citizens in the institutions, when the smooth functioning of these institutions largely depends on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the condition under which the unmarried partner of a European official may claim equal treatment. In other words, to be treated the same as if he or she were the married partner of the official.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commissioner when he says that he has often done that, that the purpose of the whole reform operation is to change an obsolete regime to reflect modern times. I believe, however, that his proposals do not meet this criterion, because he only wants to treat so-called non-traditional forms of cohabitation as equal if the people concerned can provide formal recognition by a Member State and only in cases in which they do not have access to legal marriage.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach introduces discrimination by nationality, continues to give priority to marriage and does not solve the problem. Many unmarried couples will be unable to meet these conditions. The Commissioner is obviously overlooking the fact that there are not only couples who cannot marry, but also those who do not wish to. His proposal furthermore does not do justice to the special position of European officials. I am therefore pleased that in the report by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Harbour, which we have before us, a better solution is being put forward in Amendment No 39. This is a solution which, incidentally, has been practised for many years by the European Central Bank. This rule is characterised by the beauty of its simplicity and also offers equal treatment to those who form a de facto household.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now I have not heard the Commissioner say that he would not follow Parliament’s wish on this point. May I then conclude – and I remain optimistic – that he will in fact do so and that he will use all his verve and eloquence to plead for Amendment No 39 in the Council too? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
