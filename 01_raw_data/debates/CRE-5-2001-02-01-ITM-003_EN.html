<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I am pleased to have the opportunity to update Parliament on the most recent events in relation to BSE. Many of you were present when I spoke to the Agriculture Committee last week. Nonetheless, let me very briefly summarise the main events of recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Important new measures came into effect on 1 January. These included the ban on meat and bone meal and the testing of all animals over 30 months destined for the food chain. The Commission wrote to Ministers for Agriculture on 4 January and asked for replies to an extensive questionnaire on the implementation of BSE-related measures. A working document summarising the responses was circulated to the Agriculture Council on Monday last. The opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee on a number of BSE-related questions from the Commission was published on 17 January.</p>
<p class="contents">This set the agenda for the Agriculture Council on Monday. Following the usual, very lengthy discussions, Member States agreed on the following main orientations. A ban on mechanically recovered meat. The heat treatment of ruminant fats for inclusion in animal feed and the removal of the vertebral column, the backbone, from cattle. All three of these orientations follow directly from the previous discussions in the Council on the measures necessary to restore consumer confidence. They are also based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to present proposals within the next several days on all these issues to the Standing Veterinary Committee. They will, of course, result in further controls and potentially very significant costs. However Member States are prepared to accept virtually any measure to ensure that beef is now safe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely a matter of very great regret that this determination to tackle BSE has taken so long to emerge. Only seven months ago, the Commission failed to obtain a qualified majority to ban brain and spinal cord from food for human consumption and from animal feed. Equally, not all Member States implemented a ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like now to turn to the proposals which the Commission will put to the Standing Veterinary Committee. Firstly, the one relating to mechanically recovered meat. The Commission will shortly consider a proposal to ban the use of mechanically recovered meat from all bones of ruminants of all ages. There is a case that material from bones other than the skull and vertebral column or from bones of young animals is safe. However, this involves important control problems and in the circumstances it is believed a total ban is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that the use of mechanically recovered meat is increasingly repugnant to consumers. The processed meat industry has also called for this ban. The proposed measure should therefore be very welcome to both industry and consumers. On the question of rendered fat, the Commission will propose that ruminant fats to be included in ruminant feed should be pressure cooked in addition to the current requirement that they be ultrafiltrated. The Commission will equally act on the opinion that such ruminant fats should only be sourced from discrete adipose tissues when fed as milk replacers to calves.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to reflect however if these changes can be properly enforced. For example, might there be control problems in distinguishing between different fats. If so, is there a need for a need for an outright ban on the use of ruminant fats in ruminant feed? If so, how do we ensure that the replacement fats are safe?</p>
<p class="contents">One final point on the issue of ruminant fats: it is surely incredible to the public that there should be higher standards relating to the use of ruminant fats in animal feed than applies to their use in food for human consumption. However that is the current situation and I intend to put this right.</p>
<p class="contents">On the vertebral column, the Commission intention is to require the removal of the vertebral column where there are doubts over the effectiveness of the ban on meat and bone meal or whenever it cannot be demonstrated that animals are highly unlikely to be incubating BSE. This is in keeping with the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, however there are important issues which need to be addressed. Where should the vertebral column be removed. If it is done at the abattoir, the most easily controlled location, there are implications for the storage and transport of beef carcasses. There are also risks of microbiological handling due to the increased handling involved. If instead removal is required at the butcher or retail outlet, there will be control problems in the recovery and the destruction of the bones. Similarly we need to be aware of the impact on consumers. A strict implementation of the Scientific Committee recommendations would require removal of vertebral column in animals aged over twelve months, as is currently the case in France. This will entail a ban on certain cuts of meat which are very popular – T-bone steaks and <span class="italic">bistecca fiorentina</span> for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, which Member States should be exempt from the requirement? Should for example Member States like Austria, Sweden and Finland which continue to be BSE-free be exempt? These are all issues which the Commission is urgently considering and will address in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these observations help to highlight the very complex issues which arise for what might appear at first sight to be a relatively simple measure. I am aware that the issue of controls is a concern. In this respect, the replies of Ministers to my letter of 4 January is reassuring. All Member States now insist that they are giving top priority to the secure implementation of BSE-related measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Food and Veterinary Office will continue its programme of inspections in this regard. Finally, as a further incentive to improve compliance, I am considering a proposal in the very near future to require Member States to present monthly reports on their implementation of BSE control measures. The UK and Portugal are already required to provide such a report under the restriction measures on their exports of beef. I believe it has been invaluable in ensuring that controls are actively implemented. It should therefore, I believe, be replicated at Community level.</p>

I know that many of these very far-reaching decisions are needed because past mistakes are still catching up with us. May I state clearly for the record here that BSE owes a great deal to government failings, to gross negligence in the United Kingdom and to multiple acts of negligence on the part of the Commission up to 1996 – I can honestly say that I know of no-one who got it right in the fight against BSE. Government failings are the main issue; errors were noticed too late, decisions were taken too late and when decisions or bans were introduced, there were not properly controlled. That is still dogging us. That is why the measures which you have presented, Commissioner, are without question right and proper and we call on the Member States to do their very best to implement them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, may I also state for the record that Parliament called back in November for all animals over 18 months old to be tested and, Commissioner, I see a danger here. If, with the removal programme today, the thrust of the resolution is test or remove in the sense of preventive consumer protection and several Member States test all their animals, while others test <span class="italic">or </span>remove, then by the end of the year the statistics will be meaningless and we must avoid that at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore welcome your comments on this. I should also like to ask you to clarify the problem of third countries as quickly as possible, because here too there is a huge risk from infectious materials brought in over past years. Here too, the question of uniform consumer protection arises. Then we also take account of the financial aspects. We risk destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, which is why the Commission must also see if, as in France for example, we can spread the financial burden equally and fairly between everyone in the form of a surcharge, a meat tax or by charging value added tax on agricultural products, so that a reasonable solution can be found to the problem of disposal. We must do everything, including under the financial programmes in the agricultural budget, in order to make it 20% or 30% cheaper to get animals to market, for example through sectoral agreements, otherwise we shall simply never get a grip on the situation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, we are in exactly the same situation as we were six years ago. I believe that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is due to speak after me; that means that all of us who have basically concentrated on little else in our work over the last six years except BSE are back again. The European Parliament has been calling for much of what the agricultural ministers have now decided – half willingly, half unwillingly – for over six years now. Mr Byrne intimated as much. What was done then about removing risk material? All the Member States tried to obstruct and block for as long as possible. If, Mr Byrne, as you now say, the question of removing the vertebral column is a problem, then they are again dragging their feet. What is the matter with them? For the moment we must consider the vertebral column to be risk material, in all Member States. It must be removed, it must be removed in the abattoir and it must be treated as risk material. And there is an end to it. Not here a little loophole, there a little loophole!</p>
<p class="contents">I have learned in my eleven years in the European Parliament that progress here moves at a snail's pace. It is a fact of life. We have moved forward at a snail's pace. That is fine as long as we move forward. I have nothing against that, but I would like to move a wee bit faster here, because now is our chance: we are surrounded in the Member States by jittery meat markets and, as a result, we have got jittery agricultural ministers, jittery finance ministers – everyone has got the jitters. Unfortunately, it is also affecting farmers and the meat processing industry and the feedingstuffs industry, which I always mention in the same breath as everyone who did not exactly go out of their way to do anything about improving quality in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">So if we look at these compliant meat markets and see that here is our chance, the chance to push measures forward, then we must decide exactly what sort of measures we need. They obviously include, as you have just said Mr Byrne, extending the definition of risk material, so that we can, at long last, ban all mechanically recovered meat. Of course, we could have done this years ago, but it must all be banned, not just a bit from the skull and a bit from the vertebral column like last time. We must get rid of it all; we no longer need it in an affluent society like ours, that is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">What else do we need to do? We need to do the same with animal fats. We cannot differentiate between animal fats or gelatine on the basis, for example, of whether or not they reach the human food chain or whether or not they are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. That is out of the question. Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking. End of story! No other method should be allowed now. We must minimise the risks, that is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">You said something quite wonderful, Mr Byrne and I should like to pick up on it. How do we handle derogations in the Member States for the vertebral column, fats and so on? What do we do about the Member States which are BSE-free? That is when I lean back in my chair and think to myself: here we go again. I have heard it all before in recent years. Exactly which Member State is BSE-free? And may I ask: how do they know? Do they look inside the animals' head? And if they can do that, perhaps they can tell us exactly what is going on. We too want to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as the Member States introduce comprehensive testing, and we know how slipshod testing can be, until such time as everything is tested comprehensively, including – and I agree with Mr Böge here – the animals taken from the market, then we shall never have a complete picture; until such time as there is comprehensive testing, we shall not know if Finland, Germany, Austria or Italy are BSE-free. And until we have that information, we shall treat all Member States the same, end of story. Then we shall see which Member States block everything again and we shall publicise the fact. I wonder just which Member States think they can hold out now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no time left to address all the points, but I must, nonetheless, touch on what has been my favourite subject for a long time: we can pass the best legislation here in the European Union, but what use is it if it is not controlled in the Member States? I believe that there are too few veterinarians in all the Member States, too few food inspectors, too few on-site inspections. Which is why I call on you, Mr Byrne, to force the Member States to report to you on how many veterinarians they have, how many food inspectors they have, when and what they control and what they have done in the past. I welcome and thank you for your monthly reports!</p>

We must no longer blame anyone else. Finland, Sweden and Austria did not blame anyone for BSE. We implemented certain action as long as ten or fifteen years ago, and, probably as a result of that, any risk that we might have BSE is perhaps diminished. We are not claiming that there is none, but we have implemented the action that everyone should now finally be implementing.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we should specifically ensure that each Member State genuinely complies with the decisions that have now been taken, for they are not being complied with in every Member State. For this reason, it is an excellent move on the part of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to propose setting up a subcommittee to monitor food safety and, for example, the situation regarding BSE and other such problems, so that the dangers and risks that exist might be prevented in the future, especially when we take the matter of enlargement into consideration as that will involve some very large countries with livestock joining this Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alas, you will see that subsequent events have proved me right, as they often prove us right when we give timely warnings of the risks to which the earth and mankind are exposed by unbridled liberal economics, but our warnings are not heeded until the predicted disaster has come to pass.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I can say that the BSE crisis has been underestimated by the Commission and, more especially, by the Member States. Under pressure from which lobby? Everyone in this Chamber knows that Europe's main mission since 1993 has been to operate as a large market without frontiers, a market where anything can be bought and sold, even infected meat and bone meal. Has this self-centred policy now been abandoned? I have returned from Porto Alegre, and I can tell you that the Brazilians and Argentinians whom I met there admit that they have been doing the same thing in various places, namely feeding animal carcasses to cattle. I very much fear that, if they started looking, they too would find cases of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, fifteen years after the first case of mad-cow disease, Community decisions are still lagging several steps behind the disease. The last meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers was no exception to this rule. Instead of purely and simply banning the use of animal fat in certain forms, as the Scientific Veterinary Committee had tacitly suggested, the Council preferred to take a half-measure by prescribing heat treatment of fats.</p>
<p class="contents">The update you have just presented to us, Commissioner Byrne, is disturbing on several counts. We have learned, for instance, that one Member State allows the inclusion of untreated specified-risk materials in feed mixes, that others are not managing to remove the spinal column at the abattoir and that some of the approved tests have turned out to be rather ineffective in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must ask some questions about the number of tests conducted by Member States, because some of the figures pose problems, such as those from Portugal, Greece and the United Kingdom, the country at the source of the epidemic, which conducts only 600 tests per day, as against 37 000 in Germany and 150 000 in Ireland, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">What do you intend to do, Commissioner, to harmonise these campaigns properly, to ensure that the same level of protection against this epidemic is finally guaranteed throughout Europe and that the consumer does not have to bear the whole cost alone?</p>
<p class="contents">Reorientation is necessary and must be governed by two objectives: to transform the common agricultural policy into a system of safe food production and to extend such reforms beyond cattle farming and the current crisis by addressing the issue of battery rearing in general, rather than clearing up one mistake to go on to cause another. After beating your breast about the BSE crisis today, Commissioner, do not now go on to promote genetically modified organisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the delay in implementing these measures – measures for eradicating BSE – is deplorable. These measures are always adopted reluctantly, in the wake of panic in society and this prolongs the public’s exposure to risk. It is now more than four years since this Parliament drafted recommendations that would have enabled us to prevent this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the lack of resources with which to implement the measures that have been proposed and to manage the crisis itself is also deplorable. These shortcomings betray a degree of blindness and, at times, genuine breaches in European construction. Although differences exist between Member States, it is surprising that, over time, the logistical resources for analysing and eliminating meat meal or risk-containing material have not been found. The financial shortcomings, on the other hand, are clear, both at Community and national level. Both the Community Treaties and national constitutions impose the obligation of protecting citizens’ health. It is therefore absurd to try to fund this crisis by taxing meat consumption or through the income of cattle farmers, which is causing small farms to go under.</p>
<p class="contents">At times we appear to be our own prisoners. Within the World Trade Organisation, we have accepted limits on our production by ceding a part of our vegetable protein market to the United States. So what are we going to do now? Are we going to replace animal meal with genetically modified soya, imported from the United States? Agenda 2000 laid down a reduction in aid to livestock farmers. We were aware of the consequences of this. How did we think that we would survive in the face of increasing costs and a drastic reduction in prices? On the other hand, however, Agenda 2000 does not implement measures for the development of large-scale livestock breeding either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the almost religious respect for the Financial Perspective laid down in Berlin will prevent us from being able to cope with exceptional situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us be realistic: this crisis requires a change in the European Union’s position towards the WTO, a review of the Berlin Financial Perspective and a review of the common agricultural policy to correct its imbalances and its general orientation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is to say the least disappointing, that some Member States were prepared to conceal the real incidence of BSE in their national herds and equally unwilling to implement the control measures proposed by the Commission and agreed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Their action or lack of action has led to an understandable but justified consumer resistance with beef consumption at one point dropping by 27%. Our now costly emergency plan to restore consumption and consumer confidence calls for 100% participation by each Member State. There is no place for dissidence at this critical time and those found in breach of the regulations should, in my view, be severely censured.</p>
<p class="contents">There were occasions in the past when farmers were found to be in breach of food regulations and deservedly condemned. On this occasion, however, they are by and large innocent victims of a situation beyond their control. They are the victims of animal-feed manufacturers who use meat and bone meal in bovine feed and there is some evidence, regrettably, to suggest that unscrupulous manufacturers have continued to use the product since the new regulations were introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view we are now prepared to resort to extreme measures and I accept Commissioner Byrne’s view that in the present situation they are the minimum necessary. Be that as it may, the harsh reality is that farmers who are guarantors of food supply and quality are devastated, their incomes eliminated and the ethos of farming desecrated through the destruction of a prime food product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institutions – in this case the national governments – appear only to react to crises, and never take preventative action, as if history has taught us nothing. For example, Commissioner, you have had a mandate from the Agriculture Council to apply the measures described to us. I wish you luck because I can already imagine the merry dance you will be led when you propose these measures: some Member States will request exemption, others will request an extension, for example for the spinal cord from 12 to 20 months, and others will claim to offer consumers safe meat. So this is all déjà vu to some extent and I can only hope that you have the strength and nerve to stay on course, in the sure knowledge that this will not be easy.</p>
<p class="contents">What has come to the fore in recent months is a by now familiar subject, namely the monitoring by Member States of the application of Community measures. I feel that this is the real point that should be raised with the Council because the measures to be applied are established but then the Member States either do not apply the measures – hence there are many infringement procedures, but they always take a long time – or are not in a position to implement checks. The result is that, in the end, measures which appear severe have to be taken because the checks do not ensure guarantees or safety in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something which gives rise to further difficulties because Member States tend to either conduct few checks or, when they do carry out checks, do not communicate the data available to other institutions. Therefore, Commissioner, Parliament will constantly be urging you to action, but you can also count on our support in this uphill task.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may make an observation: it is a fact that whenever you try to solve a problem, other problems arise. For example, what are we to do with the animal meal? We are to burn it. Of course, it is clear that, even today, we do not have the incineration capacity, and so it is stored. It is also clear that there have been no studies carried out on the environmental impact of the incineration of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of animal meal. A further question is what we should feed to cattle as a protein supplement. Perhaps the Members already know – although it is worth reminding them – that Europe already imports 30 million tonnes of genetically-modified soya derivatives and that the elimination of meal can only increase imports as Europe is soya dependent. So what should our approach be in the face of all this? All that can be said is that there are no miracle cures, but we must be open to finding appropriate solutions on a case by case basis and ensure that we do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The evidence is overwhelming: an average 27% drop in consumption and an ever-increasing number of export embargoes. In France alone, the beef and dairy industries account for 400 000 jobs. Victims of falling exchange rates and dwindling consumption, cattle farmers are in a desperate plight and face the threat of bankruptcy. They can no longer afford to keep livestock on their farms. Milk producers are exceeding their quotas. Consumers, worried and disorientated, no longer know what to buy. Abattoirs, condemned to inactivity, cannot stock carcasses pending the results of tests, because the results are taking too long to come through, since staff are not trained to deal with this new situation and laboratories still await official registration as test centres. Today there are only post mortem examinations. What has happened to the research into blood tests? According to Commissioner Byrne, a patent application is pending. Are we doing all we can to support research, especially public research? The systematic slaughter of herds is expensive and ruins farmers’ selective breeding programmes. Now that screening tests are compulsory, is it necessary to go on destroying healthy animals or healthy parts of animals? This systematic destruction also disposes of healthy carriers of the disease. Would it not be wise to keep part of this stock – in total isolation, of course – for research purposes? As for fighting bulls, which are considered to be at risk and are therefore subject to compulsory destruction like all other cattle that die outside abattoirs, even though there is a market for their meat, it cannot withstand being frozen for the time it takes to obtain the result of the tests and therefore ceases to be fit for consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on meat and bone meal was ultimately dictated by the fact that it was impossible to trace the sources of the meat and bone input. How should the meal be stored, burned and replaced? Sites are selected by order of the public authorities without any consultation of the local populations, environmental-impact studies or risk assessments. In order to comply with public health requirements, burning must be carried out in special facilities, and there are not yet enough of these. In spite of a protein deficit, the Member States dependent on imports of oil-protein crops cannot give assurances that the protein in their feed does not come from genetically modified crops. Yet Europe continues to take farmland out of production under the set-aside scheme. For this reason, it is becoming a matter of urgency to reopen talks within the WTO and to rethink the Blair House agreements. Europe must not reduce its support for livestock farmers, as it seems intent upon doing, by abolishing the premium for suckling cows or reducing cattle quotas, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though farmers are prepared to make strenuous efforts in order to guarantee traceability and high-quality produce, Europe must not demand even greater sacrifices of them, as the Agriculture Council did at its last meeting. On the contrary, Europe must support its farmers, even if it means paying direct grant aid. An exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures. The price of public health is well beyond the means of the agricultural budget alone. Part of the cost of guaranteeing food safety and restoring consumer confidence should therefore be charged to the general budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission does not act, it reacts. It is not pro-active enough to get a real grip on the situation. Many of the questions which bother the people affected have yet to be answered. How do we explain the different prices for BSE tests in Europe? What will we do to address distortions of competition? Why is there no effective help for the innocent victims? I refer in particular to farmers in countries which are still BSE-free and to meat product companies, abattoirs etc., all of which are struggling or fear for their existence. We are helping the wrong people. The incineration campaign in particular is blurring the data, sweeping the problem under the carpet and, most importantly, doing nothing to help the innocent victims. In countries which cannot incinerate, cattle are left standing in their stalls. The people affected cannot reasonably be expected to shoulder the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget has been earmarked for this alone. Why are BSE tests on live animals not being promoted or imposed? You must realise that, if we lose our farmers, then we also lose the very basis of our existence, because it is mainly the farmers, especially in our regions, and I refer here to the Alpine regions, who take care of the countryside. If we lose the farmers, we lose our very existence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I remind you that, only a few months ago in the Chamber in Strasbourg, I denounced the excessive cautiousness of the decisions proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have good reason to be surprised today at this furore, at this outbreak of panic in some countries which long believed that they would escape this scourge but which have nevertheless had time to observe the measures being taken in neighbouring countries. We must not let ourselves be engulfed in this wave of panic, because we bear political responsibility. Today the Commission is proposing a number of measures and, when I listen to my fellow Members, it strikes me how important it is that these measures should be harmonised. As I said, we bear political responsibility. That is why, as I have been doing for years, we must expose the shortcomings of the common agricultural policy, which has tended to favour large-scale farmers while overlooking the real world of the small farmers who are the lifeblood of our countryside. We shall need a great deal of courage if we are to establish a sustainable form of agriculture in which the healthiness and safety of farm produce and of the rural environment are the paramount considerations. We shall need not only courage but also determination to explain the new measures for the redistribution of agricultural premiums and, above all, to stand up to the Council in order to ensure that the reform process goes beyond declarations of intent. We are living through a veritable Europe-wide tragedy. We must grasp this opportunity to redefine a European agricultural policy, without playing to the galleries in the manner of José Bové, but by developing a policy that fulfils the expectations of consumers and our farmers, to whom we are bound by a strong sense of solidarity. There is no point in taking authoritarian, technocratic or restrictive decisions on the future of cattle farming. The establishment of extensive farming practices will automatically regulate production. Higher quality but smaller quantities, more stringent controls and the implementation of emergency measures are the order of the day. Let us demonstrate the resolve to take these steps without delay in the general interests of the people of Europe. This is what they rightly expect of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation has become alarming, given the fall in consumption and exports and the prospect of having to administer huge stocks of beef and veal. It is an extremely critical situation, since it has driven cattle breeders to the brink of ruin, while the amount allocated to the EU agricultural budget is almost bound to prove insufficient. In this context, Commissioner, the first imperative is that Member States show discipline and solidarity in implementing the adopted Community measures so as not to increase the size of the collective bill. Even though we shall have to await the February meeting of the Council, and probably other major European gatherings too, before all the consequences can be assessed, we can already highlight a few key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, let me point out the primacy of food safety and consumer protection, and the consequent need for tighter controls to lend credibility to the decisions that are taken as well as the need for a European food agency to be set up quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also emphasise the need to establish greater solidarity between the various sectors within the CAP in each Member State, particularly by applying the cross-sector rules enshrined in Agenda 2000. I might also mention Europe’s duty to comply with international provisions and to support the development of the production of vegetable proteins to replace meat and bone meal in animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I stress the need to take on board all the lessons we have learned from the development of agriculture which has resulted from our successive common agricultural policies and from our international commitments. Has not our past development, rooted in a quest for maximum competitiveness and a larger share of the global market, gone too far in the direction of industrialisation and profit-seeking? For my part, I believe it has reached its limits and that we shall have to rethink it, particularly in the context of the WTO talks and the framing of a new CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, how could agriculture be given the promise of a new dawn if BSE were to bring about the demise of its producers?</p>
<p class="contents">This, Commissioner, is precisely why I also plead for genuine, serious consideration of the expectations of livestock breeders and all the other players in the agricultural production process, who must receive help to ride out this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me give an example. If ruminant fat is guaranteed free from proteins, it is also free from dioxins, cinolons etc.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, distrust of the European food industry, of agriculture and of our countryside and farmers is spreading like wildfire. This is very dangerous not only for employment in Europe and for the countryside, but also for our environment and our cultural heritage. But just think if we could seize this opportunity. A wise old man once said that chaos is a neighbour of God. Let us use the present chaos creatively, for today we have our electorate’s support for opening up and transforming the entire food sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The danger has not been averted. And if there is less of a chance of catching BSE now than there was a short time ago, then it is thanks to our work here in Parliament and, I freely admit Mr Byrne, it is also thanks to the work which you have done. The new Commission and you personally are consistent in your approach, but I must nonetheless criticise certain aspects of the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">One chink in the Commission’s armour at European level was that of milk replacer and the fat contaminated with protein residue. Unfortunately it was closed too late. What is being done now is a step in the right direction. But fat is still being added, albeit heat-treated fat. And, Mr Byrne, the question is, where does the mechanically recovered meat go, if not into the food chain? Is it used for bonemeal, is it used for fat and will brain residue left behind when the skull is sucked out end up in it? Is it sterilised enough at 133 degrees? As we know, these prions are clearly proving to be resistant to heat treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be better here if we said that the only fat in milk replacer must come from the milk itself. If you really must have fat, then put the butter which has been removed back in or feed the milk straight to the animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is the brain. We still have a situation in which the brain from animals under 12 months old can be used. We can also use pigs' brains. The proof of the sausage cannot be in the eating. So what we need to do is to remove both cows' and pigs' brains from the whole sausage, from the whole food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect is testing. Mr Böge said earlier that we want to test after 18 months. I must correct him here: Parliament's resolution states that all animals which enter the food chain must be tested, starting at 18 months. This too must be guaranteed and we must not let up in our pursuit of this objective. Mr Byrne, we must not allow animals which are not being tested now to be slaughtered, because we urgently need these results for diagnostic reasons – as Mr Böge has already said – in order to evaluate the overall threat of BSE in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what you have said begs the most important questions about which neither you nor the Council have said anything. I refer to coordination and control. You have indirectly identified the shortcomings; we know that there are serious shortcomings but where are the proposals? Legislation on inspections, for example, is making no headway whatsoever at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns alternative solutions. Other Members have raised the same point. What is to be done with the meat and bone meal which has to be destroyed? What is to be done with the dangerous substances which we remove from the food chain? I know from my own country that this is a problem. But what I do not know is how they can be reliably destroyed or, more to the point, how the costs can be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my last point: how are the costs to be covered, even at European Union level? As far as I know, we have about EUR 1.5 billion in our coffers. Your lowest estimates put the cost at EUR 3.5 billion and many are saying that it might be as high as 7 or 8. Proposals for covering the cost as the budget now stands and with the financial perspectives which you support there are none. What are we going to do?

In order to do this, I call upon the Commission, as I have done on countless occasions, to provide clarification, that is to make all data available to allow correct information to contribute to reducing this collective psychosis of which, it appears, even we have been victims in part. I would like to stir things up by saying that if we limit ourselves to the facts, to the current state of affairs, one is much more likely to be struck by lightning than infected by BSE. By this I do not mean that we should not adopt all necessary precautions to prevent even a single human life being put at risk, but we should take care, because the media are causing such damage and are paralysing the sector, often without any objective information to provide accurate news. The provision of accurate information is thus an indispensable requirement if the problem is to be addressed in the proper manner and if we are to prevent psychosis being encouraged in an unjustified – I repeat – often unjustified manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to let consumers know what they are eating: in this respect the move towards compulsory labelling to provide consumers with accurate information on the animal's characteristics, from birth to slaughter, should be speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to interventions, the need to allow operators in the sector to overcome this moment of crisis should be not be forgotten. Thus, direct economic intervention should be used: it should be remembered that many breeders have thousands of head of cattle and they don't know what to do faced with the reduction in demand for their product. We need to create stockpiles through public intervention. This direct intervention must ensure that companies in financial crisis receive the direct State support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of complaints, what has become of the one that the Commission lodged against France, alleging that my country was refusing to ensure the free movement of meat? I did not hear Commissioner Byrne update us on that point in the statement he just made. The lessons to be learned with regard to the present situation are that public health must be the prime consideration, that every potential risk must be anticipated, even if the cost is high, and that we must respect the right of a Member State to apply more stringent safeguards than its partners. In particular, we demand measures designed to ensure maximum safety, even if they are a heavy burden on the Community budget. The European Union and its Member States must acknowledge their mistakes. The only way of avoiding this type of problem in the future will be to impose draconian rules enshrining caution and respect for nature. such rules will clearly entail extra costs, which in themselves will handicap European agriculture in the global marketplace. To compensate for this handicap, it will be necessary, in the context of the forthcoming WTO talks, to secure acceptance for the idea that each region of the world should be free to choose its own agricultural model, and it will likewise be necessary to undertake a radical review of the Uruguay Round model, which tends to expose agriculture to global competition without allowing for any protective or compensatory mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am concerned, and this morning's speeches confirm this feeling of unease because the BSE problem, despite your explanations and the interventions you have mentioned – which are obviously a response to an economic crisis – represents a structural crisis to which we have yet to provide a response. BSE is a moral problem: over the decades agricultural policy has been constructed around agriculture, but now a veil of distrust is coming down over the sector that we, as institutions, cannot afford to allow. The agricultural sector is a sector comprised of working people, families who work the land and people who, occupied with everyday commitments, are paying a price which is not theirs to pay. It is absolutely essential that we rewrite the rules but we cannot ask working people to pay a price – which amounts to bankruptcy in many European countries – which is not theirs to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The response to an earthquake is not “We'll see what we can do”; the response to an earthquake is appropriate and, above all, immediate intervention. European agriculture is currently experiencing one of the most critical times in its history: our dealings with the agricultural sector are not without repercussion and ultimately not only farmers will be affected but Europe itself because, in the end, the farmers and people of Europe look to us, to Europe, to the institutions, as the entity that must meet their demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The very people and the very Member States who were shrugging off your warnings two years ago, who were denying you a qualified majority, as you said just a few months ago, are now clamouring for compensation and support as the beef market collapses and we face the prospect of millions of animals in store, unsellable, undisposable of over the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom we see this with some sympathy. People will say to me: Well, yes, you were first.

<p class="contents">If Europe has fallen into line with the principle of culling animals over 30 months, is that in itself enough? What do the tests and the research findings say about the incidence of the disease in animals younger than 30 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what capacity do the Member States have for destroying the materials that are now being removed? Which Member States have the incineration capacity? Are some still saying that they will put this material into landfill?</p>

Budgetary and Community constraints cannot be used as an excuse for not adopting the necessary measures to solve the problem, and, at the same time, we must support livestock breeders. The aim of the CAP reform that we need to implement must not be to make budgetary savings but to achieve balance in the distribution of assistance amongst producing countries and productions, taking account of specific regional requirements and the situation of each Member State. New resources must be found for new requirements and so it is becoming necessary to conduct a review of the current financial framework that was decided on in Berlin.</p>

It is totally wrong for Member States now to blame the Commission when you were pointing out as long as a couple of years ago the problems that were going to occur. What Member States have done by trying to make out which beef is the safest in Europe, is to destroy European beef. There is no doubt about that. We need to take action now across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK. I saw the value of my cattle drop to virtually nothing. It is very painful for the farming industry to see this happen and it is happening now throughout the whole of Europe, so action needs to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we want to re-invent the wheel so we should look to the measures that have been taken in Britain and have restored consumer confidence. I would urge, and I know Commissioner Byrne agrees with this, to have one policy throughout Europe. If we do not, the European press will take each Member State in turn, they will look at the safety measures that are in those states and they will compare and then people’s confidence in beef in general will collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the older cattle, however painful it is, have to be taken out of the food chain. They must be destroyed. Not only is there incineration but there is now a sodium hydrolysis method of dissolving cattle. I am sure you are looking at that, because that could be a better and possibly a cheaper method of disposing of these cattle. We need also to look at imports of cattle from outside the European Union, because not only do we need to get our act together, I believe there is a lot of complacency about this in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we must get beef consumption up, we must convince the consumer that it is safe and let them eat European beef.</p>

Firstly, the Commission eventually adopted the Agriculture Committee’s proposal to use the scope that was left in the agricultural budget of EUR 970 million after all. I should add straight away that this scope appeared to be a little bigger than it actually is now, given also the present state of the euro, which has already absorbed 250 million of that amount.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the funding is therefore not complete. It merely constitutes a beginning. I would urge the Commission to look into other funding options, especially in the face of this crisis, with regard to a proposal for a consumer levy. We might consider a temporary levy on meat, as a result of which we would at least be able effectively to cover the cost of far-reaching measures this year. It is in itself nothing new that we are guaranteeing safety in this way, also with regard to other products. Just consider the environmental levy on certain products which is applied in certain EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point which is of significance in my opinion, is the question of how we deal with Member States which have knowingly flouted EU rules. Let us be honest, last year, Germany’s red/green coalition claimed time and again that it did not have any problems; the problem subsequently arose and was shifted elsewhere. How do the Commission and the Council deal with this? I have to say that in this connection, the Commission has been far more consistent over the past few years than the Council, just to quote an example.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point is to look for a solution. At the end of the day, the only solution is sound chain control, sound inspections and tough measures at times. In this connection, I believe it would be politically inappropriate to claim at this moment in time that a change in the European agricultural policy vis-à-vis small holdings or organic agriculture will solve the problem. That is not the issue. It is about food safety. The politicians in Europe had better be careful about using this crisis for their own political ends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a problem that emerged in the United Kingdom more than a decade ago and which, since then, has spread to the whole of continental Europe. At the time, the Commission probably underestimated the problem and did not adopt the necessary measures to prevent the disease spreading.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge that it was a mistake to wait until 27 March 1996 to adopt emergency measures, starting with the ban on animals and meat meal from the United Kingdom and to give in to pressure by then derogating this decision two years later, on 16 March 1998. It is time that we learnt from our mistakes and adopted effective and appropriate measures, which can be complied with without trying to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Most importantly, these measures must be uniform, because what is causing the greatest confusion, lack of direction and distrust is the lack of clear and concrete criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">You have told us what the Scientific Steering Committee thinks and what the Council intends to do, but what action is the Commission prepared to take, when is it going to act and how will it do so?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must ensure that all of these rules are complied with, because controls have proved to be our greatest shortcoming. I have always said the same thing: it is crucial that the Commission coordinates and harmonises controls and, most importantly, that it controls the controller. Clear and practical rules are essential because there are fifteen countries, each with its own problems and in some countries – in my own, to be precise – in which responsibilities for control in this field lie with the seventeen autonomous governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would suggest to the Commission that it should make an effort to communicate risks, because the profusion of news and comment in the media is contributing to the confusion and alarm in society. In addition to all of this, Commissioner, we need to think about the future of the CAP, because the root of this problem lies in the competitiveness that has been forced on the agricultural sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is what we need because, apart from BSE, we also have hysteria and panic to deal with in several areas. This initial information which we have been given is without doubt most comprehensive. But I must say, Commissioner, that I would have liked to have seen the information on the countries which you so nicely listed compared with the results of controls carried out by food and veterinary health inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, in all honesty, that I only have to think of the ignorance and squirming with which the Agriculture Council has reacted to proposals over recent months, including Parliament's proposals, to lose all confidence in information provided by Member States and ministers. Of course, there is always some cause for objection with most measures. But we all know that the measures being decided now are the result of a failure to act, including over recent years, and we cannot afford to lower our sights. A few speakers have already referred to tests. The point is: if we do not test all animals, then the results are meaningless. I have heard that the abattoirs are simply refusing to slaughter animals. What is being done? They are being clubbed without being tested. That is just not on. We must intervene here, we must sort this out throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Roth-Behrendt said we need more and better controls and indeed we do. But we also need clear-cut, comprehensible laws in Europe. We shall be dealing with hygiene regulations shortly. I say to you, in all honesty that, from what I hear from the Member States at the moment, I have no cause for optimism whatsoever. We are back on the same old merry-go-round, it is just not on. We need to stand together and give Europe clear-cut laws.

I would like to say by way of a preliminary reply to what has been said, that those who spoke on the question of consumer confidence are putting their finger on an issue that is of particular importance, in addition to the issues that we are addressing today relating to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">May I draw your attention to one particular aspect of public confidence that a number of you, in particular Mr Whitehead, referred to. Sometimes it depends to a very large extent on where Member States are in the cycle of BSE as to the effect on public confidence. Public health issues are crucially important but I want to address the consumer confidence aspect for a moment before I go on to the public health aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead rightly observed that in the UK the level of consumer confidence is high. The consumption of beef in the UK is higher than it was before 1996. Why is that the case? What lessons can we draw for consumer confidence from that? I believe it is because people see that the incidence of BSE in the UK is falling despite the fact that the number of cases is still the highest in the European Union by some considerable distance. So why are consumers relaxed about it to the extent that they are now consuming beef more than they were before 1996? I believe it is because they realise that the scientific advice had been correct; that the lawmakers have responded correctly and put safety measures in place and that the public authorities in the UK properly implemented that legislation and the consequence is that we have a falling incidence of BSE. So consumers have concluded from that: somebody is in charge, they are doing something about it, they appear to know what they are doing because the incidence is falling. Therefore their confidence rises and they consume beef.</p>
<p class="contents">That feeling has to be achieved in the rest of Europe, but it will take time because consumers do not have that sequence of events in their minds in the rest of the European Union and we all know why: because a number of Member States who declared themselves to be free of BSE within a very short space of time after making the declaration had to then admit that there was BSE in that Member State. That quite obviously provoked an immediate reaction in consumer confidence because it says to consumers: the people in charge do not know what they are talking about and are not protecting me.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to make microbiologists out of consumers, but they must have the feeling that there is someone in charge, who knows what they are doing and that what they are doing is effective in ensuring the protection of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now deal with some of the issues that you raised surrounding public health and the procedures that are needed. A number of you mentioned the question of testing. This was discussed in the Council last Monday. Testing at 30 months remains the norm, but will be kept under review. A huge number of tests under way will provide invaluable information within a very short period of time. We do not yet have enough tests and have not had them long enough to draw the appropriate conclusions. The statistical sample is not big enough, but when it is we will draw those conclusions. This will put us in a much better position to decide if further needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation third countries, I can say that the SRM decision that we made some time ago applies to third countries and to imports from third countries from 1 April next. I have written to all third countries, alerted them to the Community measures and also advised them of the dangers of meat and bone meal. And my services will hold a conference shortly with third countries to press this point home further.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the vertebral column, of course the spinal cord must be removed and destroyed. Somebody mentioned earlier: Is this not enough – why do we have to remove the entire vertebral column if the danger resides in the spinal cord? Well, of course, that fails to take into account the need to address the question of the dangers that may be posed by the dorsal root ganglia and the removal of the vertebral column is specifically directed to that particular point. The removal of the vertebral column has been a requirement from 1 October. The question is how and where. As I explained there are complications and risks depending on where it is done, at the abattoir or in the butcher’s shop. We do not have enough time to go into detail in relation to this but I repeat what I said earlier that this is an issue that we will have to give very careful consideration to.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of derogations, all Member States are currently carrying out tests on fallen and at-risk animals. This has been done on the basis of a random survey and this will help to revise the extent of the disease and give us more information. Then appropriate decisions can be made in the light of that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific issue of the number of inspections will be addressed in the report that I am requesting Member States to furnish me with. You will remember that I wrote to Member States on 4 January including an annex asking for detailed information. We have a lot of that information now in response to that letter and we will obviously be in contact with Members States all the time seeking further information and making sure that everything is kept under review.</p>
<p class="contents">References were made to the reform of the CAP. This is largely a matter for my colleague Franz Fischler, but Member States are not yet fully availing of the opportunities to provide for what might loosely described as a greener CAP. In this context I should say that Franz Fischler and I have established a joint committee with our services to look into this very issue and to see to what extent adjustments need to be made so that we can achieve a situation whereby food is produced by more natural methods. That is not to say that we are going to abandon the idea of the industrial production of food. We cannot do that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is a knee-jerk reaction that does not respond to the needs of the consumer. We must produce a lot of food to feed people and that must be properly addressed as well. But there is a desire from consumers that we should address the question of the natural production of food. I am not fully convinced that has been fully addressed in the past and after my discussions with Franz Fischler we are now going to look at this more carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody made reference to the fact of the CAP supports being more focussed on large farmers than on small farmers. I am not necessarily convinced that is the case, but there does seem to be some evidence to that effect and that is another issue that will obviously have to be addressed as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My distinguished predecessor Ms Bonino had something to say on the subject of enforcement. Of course, enforcement of measures is a key issue. The Food and Veterinary Office has a key role to play. Reports of the implementation measures will also oblige Member States to be very careful.</p>
<p class="contents">You made very relevant comments on fats also. It is not just a question of banning them. Animals have to have fat in their diet. The issue is where is this fat going to come from and are these fat sources safe. The opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee might need clarification on this particular aspect. There was considerable discussion in the Council last Monday on this issue. The conclusions refer to the fact that ruminant fat will have to be pressure cooked in the manner that we are all familiar with, but in addition a view was expressed that perhaps the time had come for the removal of animal fats from ruminant feed and that is an issue that is going to be considered. In considering that issue, you must ask what are the alternatives: vegetable fats, soyas, someone mentioned genetically modified substances. There are many complex issues which have to be addressed but I do not want to delay bringing forward the appropriate proposal for the pressure cooking of ruminant fat in the meantime. I should say in the context of the Blair House Agreement, my colleague, Franz Fischler is well aware of the demands of farmers to renegotiate the Blair House Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you made reference to budgetary considerations and I must say that the Berlin ceilings have been reached. Any increase in budget must now be agreed unanimously by all Member States. Someone also made reference to the fact that some Member States are increasing their own taxation, increasing VAT to pay for this. That is a matter for each individual Member States. The Commission has no competence to levy VAT at the point of sale of any products, and that includes agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference is also made to distortions of competition and we are faced with a crisis here. We do not have the luxury to harmonise all national measures before putting in place essential health protection measures. We must proceed with that and at the same time if the measures that we are putting in place require adjustment or fine-tuning to eliminate competition distortions then we must do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Others made reference to the need to ensure that we have harmonised measures throughout the European Union and I fully agree with that. I have said that on a number of occasions. I do believe that consumer confidence is undermined if consumers see different responses in different Member States to the same perceived risk. That undermines consumer confidence. I have said that on a number of occasions and that message has got through. I detected a mood in the Council last Monday that ministers accepted the proposition that we have to abandon unilateral measures in individual Member States and go forward with the measures that address the problem on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should have also mentioned earlier when I addressed the question of testing that live tests are not available yet. But we are carrying out a considerable amount of research in relation to this and a considerable amount of money is being spent on this. There is some is hope on the horizon in respect of live tests but nothing is absolutely clear as yet and I would not like to raise expectations or hopes in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête made reference to the operation of the CAP and I do not disagree with anything she said about its operation and how it affects large farmers, small farmers and so on. Can we continue for example with the situation where 45% of aids are paid for arable crops, a sector which is very intensive and which employs far fewer people than other principal sectors? This is an issue which must also be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Posselt referred to fats and dioxin and the question of dioxin is under active consideration by my services and by myself at the moment as a result of the publication of the report of the Scientific Steering Committee within the last couple of weeks on this very issue. They are found in fat. It is practically impossible to filter out dioxins. They have to be tackled in other ways and we are working on this at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf then asked me to address the question of a total ban of ruminant fats in animal feed. As I said earlier in this response, this is something that is being considered, was addressed by the Council last Monday and is being addressed in the context of further advice. There are control problems which make it difficult to ensure that segregation can be effective I will be happy to keep you informed of this issue as the discussion evolves.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone asked the question as to how mechanically recovered meat is going to be dealt with. Well I have say that it is going to be included in the definition of an SRM. So we extend the definition of SRM to include mechanically recovered meat which then has to be disposed of in the way that the law requires. That will be done in a manner consistent with the legislation as it currently stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
