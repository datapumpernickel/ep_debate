In other words, before which judge does one have to raise one’s concerns in the event of a transnational dispute. The Council, unanimously and within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation, that is to say, with very little sense of Community, very close to international public law, had arrived at an agreement in principle. But, lo and behold, the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force and, in accordance with Article 65, it became necessary to communitise that amendment of the Brussels and Lugano Treaty and to turn that new convention into a Community instrument: a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the Commission entered the scene and, very promptly, and in order to take initial advantage of the new Treaty of Amsterdam, decided that the communitisation of an instrument was simply a case of changing its title: instead of calling it a convention, you call it a regulation. And that is that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the Commission, with no prior consultation, with no consultation amongst the various Directorates-General, presented a draft regulation on these judicial questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in this Parliament, a report is being presented – still simply an opinion, since in this field Parliament still only has limited powers – drawn up by Mrs Diana Wallis, who I hope will speak on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">From this – and my story ends here – we must draw some conclusions:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is a lack of coordination in the Council, because the Council does not mean the Council. It means the Council in its “Justice” form. And I will go further; it takes the form of experts, of professors of international private law, who are the people who have been negotiating the international treaties which, at the end of the day, deal with this specific question. There had been no consultation with the Internal Market Council or the General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, however, and this is more important for the future, there has been a lack of coordination on the part of the Commission. It is true that it was experiencing very difficult times – it had resigned – but there was a lack of coordination in the end because the hearing on this issue took place after the publication of the proposed regulation, in violation of the most basic principles of efficiency and also respect for the citizens and this House, as well as other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that this example illustrates the difficult and demanding situation, or challenge – as you wish, Mr President – which we are facing: internal market principles, principles of international private law. That is to say, does the communitisation of an instrument, which will have to happen often, simply mean saying regulation instead of convention? The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market believes that this cannot be the case and I hope that Parliament will take the same view.</p>
<p class="contents">The communitisation of an instrument, first and foremost, means the screening of each of the regulatory proposals with respect to the founding principles of the internal market, in particular, the principle of mutual recognition and the principle of control in the State where it originated.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, communitisation means having respect for the internal market. This is important because, at the moment, completing the internal market means dealing with that border country which surrounds the regulations already in force and which, because they are rooted in procedural law and, of course, in many areas of international private law, lack clear definition. Therefore, if we lose the principles which guide the internal market, we are indirectly emptying it of its substance and heading for extreme danger.</p>
<p class="contents">And to this we can add another danger. In this age of digital revolution, we may tend to say, ‘We are global. The internal market has become too small. Let us regulate on a world scale. What is the internal market for? Let us go beyond the internal market’. Let us remember that European integration has been built on the internal market and that, furthermore, we are obliged by a Treaty to respect the principles which sustain and shape this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">“What about the consumers?”, you may ask. Well, in the example I gave, it appears that the intention is to protect consumers by offering them the opportunity to seek justice with the judge next door, their local judge. Will this protect them? I am afraid not. The evidence lies in the fact that consumers do not consider filing claims when they buy a small item, when they buy something from the local shop. Why? Because it is very expensive and long-winded. That is to say, if we want to protect consumers, we need to adopt measures, for example, the two measures presented by the Commission, the small claims procedure or the extrajudicial settlement of consumer disputes. This protects consumers: quick, cheap and effective procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, protecting consumers also means treating them as adults, not thinking of them as being incapable of making a choice. I believe that, at the moment, one of the great challenges facing Europe in this digital revolution is to change the culture and principles of consumer protection. We have to protect consumers, but protect them in deed, rather than in word, and we have to accept a culture of risk, a calculated risk for the consumer. In other words, they must be able to make fully-informed choices.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President. Europe must defend its values, but Europe has another great challenge; the balance between public legislation and self regulation. In order to defend consumers, we need a solid and protective framework of public legislation, but we also need to create an area where we can establish systems stemming from civil society which are more in accordance with our times than those which stem from the public institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The other day, at the Madrid Summit, somebody said to me, “Mrs Palacio, on the Internet, one year becomes two months. A directive which takes you four years is too slow”. Let us be quicker, let us maintain our values but, of course, let us remember that our internal market must be a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the honourable MEP, Mrs Palacio, for giving me the opportunity of elaborating upon a matter which is extremely important but also extremely complex. I would like to say the following on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Palacio, with a view to bringing about an area without internal borders pursuant to Article 2 EC, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the principle that enterprises need to be able to make their goods and services available throughout the Union without the Member State of destination imposing discriminating and unjustified obstructions. Indeed, these obstructions can lead to the fragmentation of the internal market because enterprises need to bring their goods or services into line with the regulations of all European Union countries where they are active. </p>
<p class="contents">This is our point of departure which is shared by Mrs Palacio who, in fact, stated just now that the European Union is based on the internal market. The Commission could not agree more with Mrs Palacio. However, the condition under which the principle of mutual recognition can be wholly accepted is that all Member States have an appropriate and comparable level of consumer protection. </p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal brought by the honourable MEP for a directive on certain legal aspects of e-commerce, it is expressly stated that the term “internal market” in Article 3 does not include commitments arising from consumer agreements. As Mrs Palacio is aware, commitments made in consumer agreements are governed by the Convention of Rome and, as such, do not fall within the scope of the e-commerce directive on which political agreement was reached in the Council on 7 December last. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recent initiatives taken by the Commission in the framework of the new Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community, I assume that Mrs Palacio – as she, in fact, put into words just now – particularly refers to the draft regulation which the Commission approved in July 1999, further to the activities of an ad hoc group of the Council and after political agreement by the fifteen Member States, the aim of this draft regulation being to incorporate the Treaty of Brussels of 1968 concerning legislative power and the recognition and execution of decisions in civil and commercial affairs, into derived Community legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Palacio mentioned this a minute ago and criticised the way in which the regulation proposed by the Commission has come into being. She also stated that there was little consultation, not only between Commission and Parliament, but even among the different Councils. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed amendments to the original treaty dating back to 1968 in order to bring this – it has to be said – old treaty into line with modern trading methods and, in particular, e-commerce. The honourable MEP now seems to be of the opinion that the points of departure of the draft regulation, which should communitise the Treaty of Brussels, would contravene the principle of the country of origin. This would mean, however, if she were right, that the judiciary would also come under the scope of this principle, which is not the case. Moreover, article 1 of the aforementioned draft directive on e-commerce stipulates, as has been established by political agreement in December, that this draft does not pertain to the issue of the judiciary. As Mrs Palacio is aware, the issue of the judiciary falls under the scope of the Convention of Brussels. </p>
<p class="contents">So, the present situation embraces three separate components. There is the draft directive on e-commerce. There is the Rome Convention, to which I referred just now, and there is the Brussels Convention. These are three components which, at the moment, are juxtaposed, yet independent of each other. Mr President, the Commission will ensure that due consideration is given to the objections lodged during the hearing of 4 and 5 November, on the possible effects this draft regulation will have on the internal market, and to the statements received in favour of the draft. The Commission is in the process of analysing the numerous and detailed positions it has received and will announce its proposals, if any, in due course. </p>
<p class="contents">However, it would seem useful, in any event, especially in the light of the points of criticism brought by Mrs Palacio, that the Commission, before taking any initiative, should be informed of the position which the European Parliament will be taking in February of this year. </p>
<p class="contents">It also seems necessary to me that appropriate, additional solutions should be found in order to eliminate the objections raised during the hearing by the consumer representatives. This is why it is important that negotiations take place involving all interested parties in order to find alternatives, as requested by Mrs Palacio, to the often lengthy, costly and complex judicial procedures, and this with a view to settling cross-border disputes following e-commerce transactions swiftly and with less expense for the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, can I say first of all how much I welcome what Mr Bolkestein has just said about the Commission taking a very thorough look at all the complex and intersecting pieces of legislation that are going to affect the new world in which we are living – the new world of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">I was fortunate enough to be able to attend part of the hearings on 4 and 5 November and the numbers of people involved and the quality of the contributions show how seriously people were taking this issue. That is a reflection of the concern that was felt about the initial approach.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mrs Wallis, who is preparing our report, will be speaking later and I do not want to anticipate or steal her thunder. We will be discussing that later and I know, Commissioner, you will have seen some elements of it already. The point I want to make is not from a lawyer's perspective, because I am privileged on the Committee on Legal Affairs, under Mrs Palacio’s chairmanship, to be one of the few people who are not lawyers. I should like to put forward a perspective about the issues from the point of view of both business and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The key word in this question that we pose to you, Commissioner, is balance. If we look around the world, the advent of electronic commerce or electronic communications is significantly changing the balance of the marketplace. The balance is moving strongly in favour of consumers. We are all becoming empowered consumers because that new communications technology is giving us enormous power to shop globally, to compare prices, to make our decisions on the basis of large amounts of easily accessible information. Those of you who have not experienced that should certainly do so because electronic commerce, because of this combination of computing power and information, is allowing people to compare offers and shop in a way they have never done before.</p>
<p class="contents">I give you a simple illustration. It is one that is relevant to what we are doing in legislation in the whole public sector. The office of telecommunications in the United Kingdom has a website where consumers can go and compare the details offered by all the different telecommunications companies. You put in the details of your telephone usage and you compare the different offers – that is the sort of power we will soon have available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">This new generation of empowered consumers is not going to be concerned about arguments that we might have as legislators about principles of justice and applicable law because, as Mrs Palacio pointed out, access to the courts is not uppermost in the minds of most people who shop, on the Internet or anywhere else. Before making a decision about a purchase, customers are going to want to be confident that the organisation they are dealing with provides strong conditions and guarantees and access to redress. If it is a relatively unfamiliar brand – and we should be encouraging small companies to use electronic commerce to make offers to consumers – those consumers may well want the security of some sort of approved mark, an E-trader mark, such as that, for example, which the British Consumer's Association is promoting very successfully. We shall give them great credit for that.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the sort of initiative we need to be encouraging across the European Union. That is something I would ask the Commissioner to take up as part of this whole range of issues associated with consumer legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">People will want to deal with organisations that handle problems and complaints with the same speed and efficiency with which they made their purchase on the Internet. They will want simple and effective redress and access to someone who will sort out their problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one certainty about electronic commerce and that is that it moves very fast indeed. New formats of product and service are brought to market much more quickly than ever before and our job as legislators in this Parliament is to encourage that dynamism and not to slow it down. We want to encourage consumers to use electronic information in their shopping decisions, and to encourage firms of every size, particularly the small enterprises, to participate in electronic commerce. That is clearly going to require us to rethink our regulatory framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, we are conducting a debate here today on a balanced strategy for the internal market and legal protection for consumers on the basis of an oral question which deals mainly with the opposite of the principle of the country of origin in the internal market and the principle of the country of destination in consumer protection. Such contractions are unavoidable in oral questions. But I think, and the debate so far has already demonstrated as much, that discussion of these two principles is not getting us anywhere, especially when we are talking about a suitable legal framework for electronic commerce. It is rightly feared, and I acknowledge this, that the possibility for consumers to sue under their national law before the courts in their country of residence may have a hindering or even a deterrent effect on the establishment of electronic commerce. At the same time, however, we also know that this possibility of suing in the national courts is often only theoretical and is rarely enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can hardly expect consumers to go to court in the supplier’s country of origin, since suppliers would then establish themselves in the Member States which offered the least consumer protection and had the weakest consumer laws. That will certainly not boost the confidence of consumers which electronic commerce needs if it is to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the new article 15 in the regulation submitted, either as it stands or with its restriction to offline transactions, really helps us. What we need are systems for settling disputes out of court and procedures to deal with small claims quickly. I therefore expressly welcome the measures proposed by the Commission in its communication on the future strategy, especially support for initiatives for online procedures to settle disputes out of court and for a new Green Paper on access to the law and legal redress for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that it should be possible to develop secure electronic monetary transactions and remittance systems in conjunction with the European banks and the credit card companies which allow concurrent electronic transactions. Even enhanced cooperation with consumer protection organisations and cross-border authority for these consumer protection organisations may, in the final analysis, be more helpful on a daily basis than a theoretical dispute between the principle of the country of destination and the principle of the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to expressly emphasise, following the criticism of the Commission’s proposals for the new draft regulation, that I consider the Commission’s approach to be the right one. Article 13 of the convention already regulates the place of jurisdiction for consumers and the majority of legal scholars have already expressed the view that this also applies to online transactions. The Commission is not therefore changing any aspect of the present legal situation. As we all know, Article 95, paragraph 3 requires the Commission to start from a high level of consumer protection for all its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commission has acted rightly with its proposal. We, the Socialist Group, also support the proposals made by Mrs Wallis in the Committee on Legal Affairs; she has proposed a number of amendments to the draft regulation but also insists on supplementing the existing system by introducing additional procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say on behalf of my Group that we would only consider switching to the principle of the country of origin if the legal protection of consumers is strengthened by additional procedures granting them the possibility of legal protection.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, this question highlights the tension between business and consumer interests in the context of the single market – a tension, I have to say, that I have become all too familiar with as rapporteur on the Brussels Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of coordination has been mentioned. I want to draw attention to an approach, or perhaps a buzz phrase, if you like, that is much used in the UK at the moment in relation to government. We talk about joined-up thinking or joined-up administration. In other words, bridging gaps between departments. This is also a sign of maturity, graduating, as we do at school, from writing in single letters to joined up writing.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on jurisdiction and e-commerce has highlighted this conflict between consumers and web traders. Can a consumer bring an action in his own court if he is entitled to do so? Will this be the death blow to e-commerce?</p>
<p class="contents">I propose a package of measures central to which is the theme of access to justice, much trumpeted at Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">Now if the single market is to function properly – to be fully and confidently exploited both by small businesses and consumers – there must be access to justice in civil matters. There must be small claims procedures and alternative dispute resolution. This is absolutely integral to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, our Commissioner will say that this is perhaps more the preserve of his colleague, Mr Vitorino, and perhaps also Mr Byrne. This has been my frustration. There are speeches and statements by Mr Byrne and Mr Vitorino in favour of setting up systems to deal with European small claims. We have to bring these statements together. The Commission has to start thinking in a joined-up way – as a joined-up administration. We have a once in a generation opportunity to facilitate the growth of e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">On the secondary theme, we tend to be drawn towards harmonisation as a means of resolving some of these problems – of resolving the tensions we face. But it is often that process of harmonisation, which can depend too much on legislation, that can be rigid and inflexible and then itself turn into a barrier against the single market. There are such allegations concerning the data protection directive, which is an important piece of consumer protection legislation, but in some Member States it seems to have been over-implemented, resulting in a potential barrier within the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">E-commerce is very much a global market. The solutions we adopt have to allow our citizens and businesses to participate in this wider market. In America, which need not necessarily to be our role model – they have adopted a combination of self-regulation and soft law backed by legislation. We should be prepared to look at this sort of mixture of solutions. One has already been mentioned. One of the possible solutions may lie in the hands of the credit card industry. But to take advantage of these, we must act and the Commission must act together in a joined-up manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is remarkable – and though it may be banal to say it, I cannot forbear to make the point – what a huge change the development of e-commerce is going to have on the way we all live in the coming decades and throughout this century. Speaking for myself, I did my first Christmas e-shopping this past Christmas, partly because of the new circumstances of my life and the lesser availability of the high street shops of Edinburgh to me at present. Indeed, I sent some e-flowers to my daughter on her recent marriage in Texas, and – as you will appreciate, Mr President – it was agreeable to a Scotsman to get the flowers there without the cost of a fare! We are moving into a new world. But there are, as has been said, extraordinarily difficult problems.</p>
<p class="contents">If you move away from the own-country basis, small firms will have difficulty getting into the market. Mrs Berger made a part of the point, but is it not important to remember that people who are getting into a trade need to know what they have to insure against, and local advice on that is going to be better. It makes it important that the home country principle prevails. But then the opposite problem arises. You can get long-distance rip-offs from companies in other countries that know that they are not at much risk of facing angry Mrs Smith who got a dud article through the mail. So how do you deal with that?</p>
<p class="contents">It has been mentioned twice already – and it is an important suggestion – that there should be ways in which you can use the credit card companies as a risk-spreading mechanism if they are willing to participate in this. Consumers can have rights against the credit card company in their own country, and the credit card company can have rights against the producer or seller in its country. That way, all those involved in the market would participate in a very small way in the risks across the whole market. The Commission should be looking at that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term though, we must move to a harmonisation of laws in civil and commercial matters throughout the Union. We in the UK, as you know, Mr President, ran a very successful internal market for 300 years, with two legal systems which grew together spontaneously, not by imposition. We need, in the long run, to look for that kind of development in Europe. We should have European restatements like the American restatements and let our law evolve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that the issue raised by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is, perhaps, one of the main problems that the internal market must face. Regulations in this area are flawed and inappropriate, and instead of providing overall operational certainty and uniform legal protection of the consumer, they leave much room for groundless discretion and uncertainty.<span class="bold"> </span>This is certainly the case as regards the subject the questioner gave as an example – e-commerce – and along with this, sales procedures, purchasers’ rights, their option to withdraw and, at the same time, varying levels of tax levied on the sale itself. However, this issue also affects numerous other areas: the electronic components sector – as a further example – where production might take place in several countries, including ones not in the Union, with storage and/or the affixing of the trademark in one Member State and final assembly in yet another Member State. Moreover, the problem is not so much the reliability of the individual components or their compliance with the legislation of the importing or producing state as their overall conformity with the notion of greater flexibility. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union firmly supports this view, especially if the countries of residence of the end consumers have, with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of the economic operators operating in Europe,<span class="bold"> </span>attributed specific characteristics to<span class="bold"> </span>the product on the basis of clear and pre-determined characteristics and ones which, in any case, supplement those established by the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The concept I have just explained is clearly illustrated by the agri-food sector where, with particular regard to place of origin and following derogations granted on this matter to the Member States, there is greater focus on the information which features on the label of the product intended for final sale. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that such a situation not only leads to uncertainty, but at the same time distorts competition to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses, not through proper compliance with the relevant national law but because of the fewer opportunities accorded to them precisely because of the shortcomings of Community legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the persistence of such a disadvantage for small and medium-sized businesses gives rise to fears of repercussions on employment which, in this specific case, cannot be allayed by simplifying administrative procedures, reducing set-up costs<span class="bold"> </span>or involving the social partners and their resources.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means that, as well as drafting various regulations on the issues raised and on specific matters relating to this area, we must also consolidate the requisite overall view and the legislative philosophy that serves as a real means of regulating the internal market and which provides an effective point of reference for the Member States and for every economic operator.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we believe that, in addition to the monitoring of fragmentation performed by the Commission – truly praiseworthy work as far as the process of the approximation of national laws is concerned – we must make every effort to ensure a more correct assimilation and a more accurate translation of the mandate conferred by the Council of Vienna, which was subsequently confirmed with specific regard to the internal market, with the aim of improving the European legal reference framework and that for competition, alongside<span class="bold"> </span>the elimination of barriers to trade and the improvement of services.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But is this really necessary? </p>
<p class="contents">The internal market has ensured that manufacturers and consumers can cross borders more easily. Adequate legislation needs to be in place for these cross-border transactions. This is why minimum harmonisation of legislation is necessary. A high level of consumer protection does not mean that we have to regulate everything at European level through maximum harmonisation. Quite the reverse, in fact. We need to seek the best possible solution for the consumer, in this case a trusted frame of reference. This will frequently be a national framework. </p>
<p class="contents">In the case of e-commerce, the country of origin in the Union can be chosen more or less at random. This does not add to consumer confidence. This is why consumers must be given the choice to opt for the legislation of their own country. The objection that this would lead to unwanted barriers to trade seems incorrect to me. Consumer protection creates a necessary, politically desirable pre-condition for trade, designed to protect the weaker party. </p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Commission’s approach does not lead to an endless tussle regarding the desirable level of harmonisation. Neither does it require new legislation at EU or national level and it respects the principle of subsidiarity. There is nothing unbalanced about the Commission’s strategy. At the outside, there may be something unbalanced about the strategy of the Committee on Legal Affairs which is endlessly hammering away about communitisation, using arguments which seem false to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget that consumers too greatly benefit from being able to use e-commerce well. But what are we faced with now? A fierce discussion between industry and consumers about the legislation which applies in the case of cross-border trade which is increasingly taking place electronically. Suppliers of products and services support the home country principle according to which the legislation of the country where the supplier is based applies. I can understand that. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, take an example. If you, as a Portuguese citizen, buy a computer via the Internet from a supplier in Finland – by the way, the Finns have sound consumer protection – the home country principle will apply according to Finnish law. The expensive computer, however, does not arrive whilst you have already paid for it by credit card. Would this Portuguese person like to start a court case in Finland? I do not think so. This would mean that you would also need to obtain legal advice in Finland or about Finnish legislation. But, Mr Bolkestein, there is more. More than what you have mentioned because the European consumer is protected by more rules than just legislation on e-commerce or the regulations you just mentioned. There is also a directive on ‘distance selling’. A directive on ‘financial services’ is under way. There is also a privacy directive. These contain minimum guarantees, sometimes maximum guarantees, for the consumer. The proposed legislation on e-commerce adds a number of extra measures to these. </p>
<p class="contents">Two different Commission proposals have also been tabled in this regard. It is difficult, however, to know where to turn for legal protection. On the one hand, there is e-commerce which is based on the home country principle and, on the other, there is the proposal for this new, adapted Brussels regulation. Although – and I agree with Mr Bolkestein on this – it is quite possible to combine both proposals to the letter, the underlying idea is definitely contradictory. So this leads to confusion, and the legal protection accompanying e-commerce therefore faces teething problems. Mr President, in my opinion, we as the European Parliament are also liable for arranging proper consumer protection. After all, the consumer benefits from a transparent and consistent system of legal protection because, without consumer confidence, e-commerce cannot really come into its own and take off completely. We must, therefore, in my opinion, more so than we have done so far, consider what the alternatives are for offering legal protection to consumers, even when something goes wrong. Then I think, and this is why I call upon Commissioner Bolkestein, that we should take a much better look at the alternative systems for settling disputes. As you know, the Netherlands boasts a finely tuned system of alternative dispute settlements which, in fact, could also work on a cross-border basis, where the Conciliation Committees Foundation already enables people from abroad to lodge objections with this Foundation in The Hague. Justice is also administered there. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, one of the solutions is to find a different course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is at issue here? The subject can be summed up in the following catchwords: consumer protection and electronic commerce in a force field. Or, to put it another way: how can consumers in the European Union be efficiently protected without hampering the development of e-commerce? The discussion is focusing at present on the question of the principle to be used to determine the place of jurisdiction and, subsequently, the applicable law in the event of cross-border disputes in electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Must a consumer enforce his rights before the court in the country in which the supplier of the goods or services is established or in the country in which he lives? Which law applies? I do not want to address the pros and cons of this question again today. We are all sufficiently familiar with them. The Commission held a hearing on this in November. I should just like to point out today that, in my view, the discussion of consumer protection on the one side and e-commerce business on the other has been too narrow and too short. It also contradicts the strategy formulated by the Commission itself in its communication on a strategy for the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication expressly states that balanced solutions are needed if the interests of consumers and the economy diverge and that electronic commerce in the European Union must be given a realistic chance to develop. However, a balanced solution can only be found in the force field between consumer protection and e-commerce business if a wide discussion is held, beyond the limited question of the right place of jurisdiction and the applicable law.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of efficient consumer protection is surely to ensure that consumers can enforce their rights quickly, cheaply and without red tape. Does this in fact apply if the consumer can sue in his place of residence on the basis of the law of his land? In principle, a judgement in his country of residence gives the consumer stones, not bread, because he then has to enforce or execute the judgement in another Member State. That is generally a lengthy, arduous and cost-intensive process. If we are to have efficient consumer protection, alternatives to costly and slow court proceedings, irrespective of which court or under which law, must be evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the magic words are settlement of disputes out of court, if necessary in connection with further harmonisation. The Directorate-General has already dealt in detail with the subject of out-of-court settlement of disputes in connection with cross-border financial services and it held a hearing on the subject in October last year. I propose that we evaluate in detail the knowledge and ideas in both the Commission’s working paper on which the hearing was based and the communication on the results of the hearing expected in the middle of this year for the purposes of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach in the e-commerce directive is, in my view, the preferable political approach and should not therefore be contradicted by the regulation in the Brussels/Lugano Convention or in Rome II. I therefore propose that we proceed either by postponing any amendment to the Brussels/Lugano Convention until all the outstanding legal issues in this area have been regulated or that we amend the Brussels/Lugano Convention but maintain the status quo of the balance of interests between suppliers and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start with an expression used by Mr Harbour and I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Harbour for the keen interest he has shown during the hearings of 4 and 5 November. The Commission always highly appreciates it if Members of this Parliament attend a hearing or other activities and I should like to take the opportunity to underline this, Mr President. Well now, Mr Harbour talked about “balance” and this is, of course, what the Commission pursues. You will understand, Mr President, that I am not only speaking on my own behalf and that of my own Directorate-General, but also on behalf of the entire Commission. The Commission comprises, among others, Mr Byrne, who has the interests of consumers at heart and, in my response in this debate, Mr President, I inevitably refer to Mr Byrne’s positions so that we, as Mrs Wallis put it, display a joined-up administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Well now, we are pursuing that balance, and this is a balance between the interests of the manufacturer on the one hand and the interests of the consumer on the other. So much is clear and the arguments are naturally evident too. We are hoping to achieve this balance. In my opinion, we managed to strike this balance in the directive on e-commerce. The principle of this directive is that the country of origin plays a decisive role when legal proceedings are instituted in connection with e-commerce. There is a derogation with regard to public order, to put it in general terms, but this derogation is strictly defined. It has to pertain to certain goals and not others. It must be a derogation which is necessary. The country where the infringement occurs, the infringement of public order, must be called to account. It must be given the opportunity to take measures, and the Commission must be informed. The Commission must be given the opportunity to take action against the country which has allowed the infringement to happen. In other words, the directive on e-commerce is based on the country of origin with a derogation which is, however, strictly defined. Mr President, may I also take this opportunity to urge this Parliament to approve the directive appropriately, that is to say swiftly, so that, on expiry of the Internal Market Council in May, it can find its way into European legislation. Everyone is waiting for a European directive on e-commerce, and I hope that we can achieve this in May. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to broach a different subject which has also been mentioned by a number of MEPs, not least by Mrs Palacio, but also by Mrs Oomen, for example, and this is the Brussels Convention. I take on board the criticism levelled by Mrs Palacio on the way in which the Commission’s proposal came about. We will draw lessons from that, but I would still urge Parliament, and the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, to form an opinion on this difficult point of Article 15. If I am not mistaken, Mr President, Article 15 of the Commission’s proposal on this Brussels Convention deviates on one key point from the original convention in favour of consumer protection. Indeed, in the original convention dating back to 1968, the opportunity of consumers to invoke their own rights was subject to two requirements. Of those two requirements, one has been eliminated from the Commission’s proposal. Well now, this is a matter of high importance and which has given cause for concern among the various organisations which are involved in this. It is an issue which is preoccupying the Commission. I myself will be holding a small meeting next Wednesday, involving four other Commissioners, including Commissioner Byrne, Commissioner Vitorino and Commissioner Liikanen, to gather our thoughts on Article 15. At the same time, however, if you will allow me, Mr President, and if Mrs Palacio permits me, I would like to call on the Committee on Legal Affairs to pay due attention to Article 15, thus allowing the Commission to find out at an early stage what Mrs Palacio’s committee thinks. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallis was right to use the term joined-up administration. Well now, in consultation with Parliament, let us think of a more detailed description of Article 15, as defined in the Commission’s proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a number of Members of this Parliament, Mrs Wallis, Mrs Oomen and, of course, Mrs Palacio, have referred to small claim procedures, on the one hand, and alternative dispute settlements on the other. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will understand that these are matters which do not directly fall under my remit but concern my colleague, Mr Vitorino more. This does not detract from the fact that they are, of course, closely related to this subject as a whole and that these accelerated and simplified methods of bringing legal disputes to an end are, naturally, very closely related to the functioning of the internal market. That is why I feel such a connection with this dossier. But honesty requires me to say that it is Antonio Vitorino who is primarily responsible for these matters. </p>
<p class="contents">Well now, I have just mentioned that we, four or five Commissioners, will be meeting next Wednesday. I can tell you now that I will be emphasising and drawing attention to the need to arrive at these two accelerated, simplified methods of ending minor legal disputes concerning e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, and I would like to finish on this remark: we are trying to seek a balance; we are trying to find a balance. We do not want, on the one hand, what Mr MacCormick suggested. We do not want any ‘long-distance rip-offs’. That is something we do not want. I would thank Mr MacCormick for this colourful phrase. On the other hand, we do not want what Mrs Wallis suggested either, a situation in which excessive protection leads to violations of the internal market. That is something we do not want. We do not want the one, but neither do we want the other. We will have to find the right way, between Scylla and Charybdis, to benefit the internal market i.e. all consumers in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
