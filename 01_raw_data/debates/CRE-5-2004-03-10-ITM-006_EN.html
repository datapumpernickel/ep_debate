<p class="contents">Since the United Kingdom joined France and Germany in backing certain Community policies such as defence, and supported both countries when they failed to comply with the Stability Pact, some elements in the institutions and the media interpret this as meaning that, in the face of the problems arising in the adoption of the draft Constitution, the axis formed by these three countries is moving towards the creation of a 'pioneer' group, which would lead to a two-speed Europe relatively remote from the other Community democratic institutions. What steps will the Presidency of the Council take to avert this grave danger, whilst seeking agreement for the adoption of the draft Constitution submitted by the Convention? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Cuban Book Fair</span></p>
<p class="contents">Cuba's annual Book fair is a cultural and media event of great international prestige. This year the organisers planned that Germany should be 'guest of honour', but the German government, in line with the Common Position defined by the Council and its recent policy of cultural sanctions against Cuba, turned down the invitation. However, the number of writers and publishers from Germany and other EU countries attending has not been reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council consider that the Common Position and the sanctions are beneficial, or merely detrimental to both Cuban and European culture? Did the Council not feel that its authority was being undermined, in view of the fact that the European businessmen and authors invited to the Book Fair ignored the Council's line and will take part? A number of them have said that the policy of cultural sanctions imposed on Cuba by the EU is 'absurd, unjust and contrary to our interests'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This took the form of the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on a large number of dissidents for exercising their right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs, as well as the summary trial and the rapid execution of three hijackers of a ferry boat, in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The four measures announced on 5 June 2003 were symbolic and political in nature and therefore their implementation concerns only the governments of the European Union Member States and their officials. It does not affect the private sector or individual citizens, who are free to attend the Cuban Book Fair and indeed any other cultural event organised by the government of Cuba if they so wish.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the private opinions mentioned in the question, the Council has no comment to make on what those attending the fair may have had to say. They have the right to express their views, even if their views are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again the EU calls on the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners without delay and to resume the de facto moratorium on the death penalty. The Council reaffirms the continuing validity of the common position as the basis of the European Union's constructive engagement with Cuba, to be pursued through political dialogue so that tangible results can be achieved, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few months ago there were certain actions by the Cuban authorities which the European Union reacted to with measures which you thought were appropriate and which I thought were disproportionate, unfair and absurd – particularly those adopted in the field of cultural cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know what you want to call these measures. You say they are not sanctions. I would like to find another word. I do not know if they are restrictions, reprisals, pressure, coercion, cultural blockade – as the Cubans themselves say. I would like you to tell us what word we should use so that we can really receive an answer to what we are asking.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that question, I would reiterate the question which I have put: do you believe that the measures adopted in the field of cultural cooperation help or harm Cubans and Europeans? And, secondly, does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the conduct of our civil society, participating en masse in activities which have been, if not boycotted, at least hindered by the European Union, is a way for civil society to raise doubts about the Union’s policy with regard to Cuba? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I mentioned, the measures were symbolic and political in their nature and therefore the implementation concerns only governments and EU Member States. They do not have a direct implication so far as individual citizens are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also make the point that the measures which were announced on 5 June were taken only after the most careful deliberations. It was the Council's considered view at that time that the application of the measures represented a balance between maintaining the willingness to engage in political dialogue to allow for tangible results, and the necessity to make it clear that grave human rights violations such as those that have occurred in Cuba in the last 12 months were not acceptable. I am sure that Mr Martínez would accept that is the position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on a general issue regarding the EU and Cuba: the measures adopted by the Council were very carefully calibrated. Some people might say that they are very mild, but the are proportionate in response to specific circumstances. The European Union values this relationship with Cuba and hopes that those relations can be improved. It is mutually beneficial to aim for an improvement in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just returned from Cuba, where I was able to observe the situation on the ground with an open mind, and a visit to the island might not be a bad idea for some in view of the way in which violations of human rights are discussed in this House. As a result of our policy towards that country, we are overlooking a real treasure. Whatever might be said about Cuba, the country has a great deal to offer; we can learn a lot from it, certainly in the field of actions for the benefit of specific target groups in selected neighbourhoods. Moreover, it is regrettable that Europe's attitude means that many European NGOs are now having a very difficult time over there. They would like Europe to restore and improve relations with Cuba and look at that country from a different perspective without being influenced by third parties. There are many rumours about Cuba and, compared to other countries, we look at that country with different eyes. Without going into specifics, I could list other countries where the death penalty is still in place. In short, there are lots of exciting things happening in Cuba, and it would be useful to visit that country and take a dispassionate look at it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure Cuba is an intriguing and interesting country. The diplomatic measures announced on 5 June were intended to send a signal to the Cuban authorities that the new and grave violations of human rights simply were not acceptable. The measures were not designed to isolate Cuba in any way. On the contrary, in reconfirming the validity of the common position on Cuba on 21 July 2003, the Council stressed that political dialogue should be continued with a view to producing tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and rights spheres. The Council remains very much open to political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the point made about the impact, the Cuban Government is aware that the Council acknowledges its significant achievements in the field of social rights such as health and education. However, it remains our earnest hope that the Cuban authorities will come to realise the necessity to make similar advances in the field of fundamental civil, political and human rights. The same level of achievement in those areas as in the areas mentioned by the honourable Member would be very welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have provided you with all the details of the documents in question, and it seems to me very strange that there was no time to read them. It is, for example, very clear from these documents that, as we know, Northwest has a cooperation agreement with KLM and that there is therefore a huge overlap between airline reservation databases, including those relating to air traffic internal to the European Union. You said that the issue is the Commission’s responsibility. This is not the truth, because the international agreements are commissioned by the Council; it is the Council that gave the European Commission the mandate to determine adequacy finding of privacy protection in the United States.

At the moment, the Council is discussing a European agreement with the United States, whereby the Article 31 Committee, which is competent in this area, has given, or as good as given, the green light on behalf of the Council, to the conclusion of an agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The annex to this agreement also refers to CAPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-screening System II). It is therefore highly unlikely that the Council is unaware of what is going on, and Mr Cappato's question is in my view very plain: he has asked whether this is not a case of illegality and of violation of our regulations. The Council cannot say that this is a matter for the data protection authorities alone, which have themselves indicated that this is illegal. Action is indeed needed. The Council is right to say that this should be done at national level, but it too has a task to perform here. The Council has, to some extent, passed this task on to the European Commission, being apparently unfamiliar with the facts involved, and – what is worse – has not informed the national parliaments. I therefore ask the Council to ensure that this is still done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The general question of the transfer to the US authorities of name records for transatlantic flights is of great concern to the Council. We are not questioning either the concerns of the Members or particularly the concerns that Mr Cappato outlined in his original point. This matter is the subject of ongoing discussions and negotiations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the unilateral introduction last year of a US requirement on European airlines to provide passenger name records on flights into the US, the European Union has been working to establish a legally secured framework for passenger name record transfers to US customs and to border protection bureaux.</p>
<p class="contents">Every effort is being made in the current negotiations to enhance the legally binding nature of the undertaking so as to protect the privacy of European passenger data, which is the point made in the supplementary question. However, this is not simply an EU-US issue, as it is fully expected that passenger name record transfers will also be required by a number of other countries in the near future in order to enhance passenger security in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is therefore pursing a global approach with regard to the transfer of such data for border and aviation security purposes. This is largely an initiative to create a multilateral framework for passenger name record data transfers under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. It is proposed that any arrangement agreed with the US will be of an interim nature and will in due course be confirmed by international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposed EU-US international agreement on the transfer of name records, I would specifically mention that, as honourable Members will be aware, negotiations are still ongoing between the Commission – and it is the Commission that is handling those negotiations – and the US authorities. Once negotiations have been concluded this agreement will be submitted and it will be considered by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU-US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue.

<p class="contents">I would hope that the Council will take this issue very seriously and not give in to pressure, despite the fact that there may be some countries in the European Union that would wish to do so.

With regard to trafficking in human beings, the Council would like to refer to its reply to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0575_EN.html">H-0575/03</a>. As already pointed out in that reply, the comprehensive issue of trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed both at national and international level and needs to be dealt with within a broader context, which involves criminal law, asylum, immigration policies and preventative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">A general agreement has been reached in the Council on a proposal for a Council directive on the residence permits issued to third-country nationals who have been victims of trafficking and who cooperate with the competent authorities. The purpose of the proposal is to offer victims who are willing to cooperate in proceedings against traffickers the possibility to remain in Member States for the duration of those proceedings and to obtain other benefits to assist them in escaping from the influence of the traffickers and returning to a normal life. Such other benefits may include, for example, access to employment, vocational training and education and other special programmes. This instrument, when adopted, will have an important role in the fight against traffickers. Formal adoption will be possible when Parliament has delivered its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, which was adopted on 19 July 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography on 22 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as border controls are concerned, the Council recalls that in 2002 two plans were submitted which contained a series of measures designed to achieve a higher level of security at the external borders and to combat trafficking in human beings. The first is a comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, which was approved by the Council in February 2002. The second was the plan for the management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which was approved by the Council on 13 June 2002. Both plans contain short- and long-term measures aimed at creating integrated border management.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2002, various pilot projects and joint operations have been launched at the external borders. A network of Member State liaison officers has been created; a common risk analysis model and a common core curriculum for border guard training has been established. They are very welcome measures. Various ad hoc centres were set up or are in the process of being established by Member States, each of which focuses on a specific type of border, for example an air-border centre, a land-border centre, or a sea-border centre. Furthermore, a centre for ad hoc border guard training and a risk analysis centre are also being set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I mentioned a number of events and the response I gave was comprehensive. Other joint operations are planned and will be carried out in the near future at land, sea and air borders in Member States and the accession countries – which is the concern raised by the speaker.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council is awarding special attention to the setting-up of a European agency for the management of cooperation at external borders, which will integrate ad hoc centres into an institutional framework within the Community. That would be very much in line with the Member's thinking. On 27 November 2003, for example, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a conclusion on the main elements of this agency. It was agreed that this agency would, inter alia, coordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the management of their external borders, assist Member States in the training of border guards, carry out the type of risk analysis that I have already mentioned, and assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical cooperation at borders. I hope that this answers the Member's question. One of the extraordinary things about this particular pernicious trade is that its perpetrators have been extremely astute in the manner in which they have managed to smuggle their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework decision on combating the exploitation of children and child pornography relates to this whole area. It was adopted on 22 December 2003 and requires each Member State to take the necessary measures to ensure that all conduct relating to child pornography and child exploitation at an international scale is fully punishable.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, this is a pernicious trade carried out by ruthless people. It is the 21st century equivalent of slavery. However, any fair, objective analysis would suggest that the Union is addressing the issue on a significant number of fronts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the beginning of this year an information sheet on 'entry into the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority' has been distributed to visitors, voluntary workers and officials of the European Union and international organisations. The document states that entry into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, referred to as Judea and Samaria (Areas A) is forbidden without prior written authorisation from the Israeli authorities. Entry into these territories without such authorisation may result in legal measures being taken against the persons concerned, including deportation and refusal of future re-entry into Israel.</p>

<p class="contents">In a recent joint report requested by the Council of the European Union, heads of mission in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Ramallah confirmed these restrictions, which have been progressively identified and which have a considerable impact on the freedom of movement of European Union citizens, representatives of churches, journalists, NGOs and even European Union officials and diplomatic staff. Their application on the ground often appears to be unclear and disproportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States closely coordinate their approaches to these issues. They raise the problems of access to the Palestinian territories in their regular dialogue with the Israeli government officials. Moreover, the European Union plays a leading role in the task force on project implementation established by the international community to deal with problems of access for development assistance workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is another issue, over and above our freedom of movement, that I believe the Council must take into consideration, that is to say Palestinian sovereignty. In the current situation, not only can Palestinians no longer receive voluntary workers, officials or citizens but, in effect, they are also prisoners – partly due to what is currently happening with the Wall – within Palestine. Therefore, the Oslo agreement, which instead provides for autonomous Palestinian areas, is being rendered totally ineffective by Israel when the latter restricts the movement of foreign citizens too. I therefore believe that the Council should consider this aspect too and, above all, take specific action to stop Israel preventing freedom of movement, partly because, as things are, we can also respond in kind. If we have problems entering Israel, then perhaps Israeli citizens could also have problems entering Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Historically, these provisions, which came under primary law as regards Article 2 and 4 of the Treaty and under secondary law as regards Regulation No 1/58, have been adopted only on the occasion of accessions, by means of successive accession treaties. Thus, Article 61 of the Athens Accession Treaty provides for the translation into the new languages of the text of the original treaties and of the Treaties amending or supplementing them. These translations are annexed to the Act of Accession and are authentic under the same considerations as the original texts of the Treaties. In other words, after accession the Treaties will have to be interpreted on the basis of the text existing in twenty-one languages and not just in the four original languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation No 1/58, as most recently amended by the Treaty of Athens, brings to twenty the number of official languages and working languages of the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the accession of Ireland to the Community, the original Treaties were translated into Irish. The Irish language version is an authentic version of these Treaties. Although Irish has not been added to the list of official languages and working languages of the institutions, each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the eleven other working languages. The texts in Irish are equally authentic and have equal status with those in all the other languages.</p>

I agree wholeheartedly with the opening point. The extraordinary thing that has happened in the last 30 years has been the explosion of interest in a language that 30 years ago looked as if it was threatened. One of the arguments made 30 years ago was that minority languages would be crushed and in particular the Irish language would disappear in the European Union. That has not happened. Mr Crowley is absolutely correct when he says that one of the extraordinary features has been the explosion of interest in the education sector in the Irish language. The most rapidly growing part of education in Ireland is the Gaelscoileanna, the all-Irish schools at first and second level. He is correct in that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government welcomes that. We always said that the European Union would not bring about the end of our language; our cultural identity is stronger now than it ever was.</p>
<p class="contents">The language has been accorded a quite distinct status within the Union since Ireland joined in 1973. The Treaty status of the language was agreed in 1973 and that right was re-established in the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. It is also set out fully in the new Treaty; there is a little additional progress there.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, a number of positive steps have been taken by the Union in relation to the Irish language, for example, the Treaty of Amsterdam confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any institutions in any of the Treaty languages, including Irish. If my memory serves me correctly, Article 42 in the new Treaty makes a specific cross-reference to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard such steps as clearly beneficial moves towards the Irish language. They reflect the sort of constructive measures that can have a meaningful impact on the citizens' relationship with the Union and its institutions. In short, they are practical measures that make a difference. Irish is the only language other than those specified in Council Regulation No 1 of 1958 to which these rights apply. Additionally, Lingua, the Union's programme for the promotion of language teaching and learning recognises the Irish language for its purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out in my answer, the government of Ireland has set up a working group to establish what further steps can be taken. It is not, as some people believe, simply a matter of knocking on the door, <span class="italic">cnagar ar an doras</span>. We are engaged in the matter; I am aware of the debate; it is a debate in which I take an interest. Indeed, as someone who comes from the Gaeltacht part of Ireland, I – like Mr Crowley – take a passionate interest in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent revelations about the secret network illicitly trading in highly sensitive nuclear equipment and technology organised by the former Pakistani chief scientist, Abul Qadeer Khan, are of very serious concern. During the recent European Union ministerial troika to Islamabad, these concerns were raised at the highest level with Pakistan and we were assured that new controls have been put in place in order to prevent proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, exports of sensitive equipment and technology are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000. With regard to the export of weapons-usable materials – for example plutonium and highly enriched uranium – from the European Union, this can only be authorised in accordance with the above-mentioned regulation, as well as other relevant international rules and practices governing such exports. Furthermore, all nuclear material within the European Union – as long as it remains in the civilian nuclear fuel cycle – is safeguarded by the nuclear inspection services of the Commission and, where the material is to be transferred outside the European Union, by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of export to third countries, the IAEA will also apply safeguards to the third country and will, inter alia, verify the declaration on quantity and composition made before the shipment of any material.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Pakistan, the issue raised by the Member, there is an additional consideration. Unlike all European Union Member States, Pakistan is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and does not have a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles and the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and the disarmament agreed at the 1995 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference state that full-scope safeguards should be a necessary precondition for transfers of source and special fissionable material or specially designed material thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuclear suppliers group and the export control regime in which all EU Member States participate designates full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply for sensitive nuclear and related technology. It follows that no Member State should authorise the export of nuclear material in any form to Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is committed to continuing to strengthen export control policies and practices in cooperation with our partners in various export control regimes and in other third countries. This is reflected in the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the last European Council meeting in December in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, all of us, and the EU institutions in particular, need to recognise that the plutonium being sent across the seas to Japan from both Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France is directly usable in nuclear explosive devices. If terrorists were to get hold of this material we would be facing devastation. We have already had the example of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">This trade undermines all attempts to halt proliferation, and I would draw the presidency's attention to a statement made in Washington by President George W. Bush on February 11, when he said that reprocessing is unnecessary for civil nuclear energy programmes. The tenor of his remarks is to condemn reprocessing as a sinister activity. We need to get a grip on proliferation, and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the presidency to take the lead in strengthening the European Union's non-proliferation credentials by pressing the UK and France to stop this commerce in plutonium, which was not named after Pluto the God of the Underworld for nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is quite right when she says it was not named by accident: perhaps it was a happy accident that it was named after the God of the Underworld.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue raised in the first part of the question is absolutely terrifying. Since that report became available, there have been further reports of people travelling with caesium in the boot of the car. These reports, and their implications, are terrifying. They are, if anything, more horrific than heroin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is engaged in the issue; we have made the concerns of the Community known to the Pakistani authorities. I take the point Ms Ahern made in her supplementary about matters nearer to home, but it is not up to me to provide a definitive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The general point about non-proliferation is that the strengthening of the Non-proliferation Treaty is obviously the way to go and that is the way that civilised countries will go. Since September 11 we have a different view on security, and we should all be very conscious of the implications in this particular area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
