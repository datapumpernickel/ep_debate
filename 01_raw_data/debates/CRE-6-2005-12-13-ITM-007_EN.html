<p class="contents">We are therefore going to have to accept the challenge – the globalisation challenge, the climate change challenge, the energy challenge and the demographic challenge – if we are to meet Europeans’ expectations and if Europeans are to understand that Europe is not some amorphous mass bearing no relation to themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">From this viewpoint, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are proposing practical guidelines to you for 2006, something that was sorely lacking in your programme, Commissioner, not least in terms of transforming the Lisbon Strategy objectives into actions. In order to improve European competitiveness, we will see to it that all forms of bureaucracy are reduced and that all unnecessary legislation is done away with. In this context, it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex-post evaluation of the measures adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE also lays emphasis on the completion of the internal market, the optimal running of which is crucial for all of our businesses, for all of our jobs and for our consumers. Our economy must be able to rely on the rapid completion of the large-scale trans-European transport network projects, which will need to be funded not only by the European budget, but also by public-private partnerships, which are also central to our ambition for research, an ambition requiring more than just lip service. The budget dedicated to the new framework programme for research and innovation will be enlightening. We will be exacting with regard to the appropriations available and the way in which these are used. This research is the key to our future jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the PPE-DE will also pay a great deal of attention to the external borders of the European Union. We call on you, for 2006, genuinely to begin to reflect on the Union’s absorption capacity and openly to debate this issue with Parliament. This is a very important issue for our citizens, who question us on this point every day, just as they question us on the fight against illegal immigration or the strengthening of border control capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">To strengthen our border control capacities, we must increasingly use biometric data and ensure better cooperation between information systems – a crucial kind of cooperation that we must also see applied in the contexts of cyber security, the fight against terrorism and the fight against crime. We have a high-performance tool – Europol – and it is time we provided it with a Community legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union can bring its added value to other areas, such as health care. We look forward to practical measures being implemented in relation to the fight against obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer or psychological problems. The PPE-DE also wants a proposal in favour of patients’ mobility and of providing them with information.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the European Union’s duty to take charge of education. We regret your lack of ambition, particularly in relation to improving language teaching and to developing our university centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you know that the fulfilment of our objectives together with Europe’s everyday added value are dependent on two fundamental requirements. On the one hand, the institutional rules governing the functioning of the European Union: you are aware of our attachment to the Constitutional Treaty; a strong initiative is urgently required to restart the debate. On the other hand, the financial perspective: a budget that meets everyone’s expectations, a strong budget for a powerful Europe and not just a few coins casually put on the table by the Council, like some shabby tip. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, it is to our great advantage that we can support the Commission when we believe it is going down the right road and criticise it when we believe there are things to be set right. If I may begin with Plan D, for which you have personal responsibility, I can say that you will have this group’s wholehearted support. I hope that you yourself will, next year, be able to devote your full energy to getting the Constitution and the debate on the issues around it across to the public and thereby completing your achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Barroso’s criticisms of the draft budget – which he described as a mini-budget for a mini-Europe – I have to say that we agree with him, and our chairman, Mr Schulz, has said so in plain terms. I hope that our President will stand sufficiently firm in the dialogue to ensure that the interests of Europe as a whole are defended.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the ‘better regulation’ issue, we agree with you that what really matters is that the process of enacting Europe’s laws be made more efficient and more readily comprehensible, not least from the point of view of the man and woman in the street, and, with this in mind, I would ask the members of the Commission – all of them – to read through the draft of the services directive and then say whether or not they find it comprehensible or an example of ‘better regulation’. Quite apart from its social content, it would be very interesting to discuss that with you, but that can, of course, wait for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about two things to which our Socialist Group in the European Parliament will be giving particular attention next year. The first is the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in Europe, in relation to which especially objectionable things have come to light and occurred in recent months, and I am not referring only to the activities of the CIA, but rather – to give a couple of examples –to the restriction of trade union rights in Slovakia, and also, in this context, certain attitudes that have become apparent in the new Member State of Poland as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of homosexual persons and others. All these developments we regard with concern. I would like to assure Commissioner Frattini of our full support and urge him to forthrightly defend Europe’s rights and standards in this area. That is the only thing we demand of him.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the most important issue, which is that of ‘social Europe’. We, in our group, know as well as anyone else that there is no long-term job security; we also know that many people have to change jobs again and again, but it is precisely for that reason that this Commission needs to take tougher action on social issues, and be seen to do so. Many members of the public – as you, Madam Vice-President, will know from your dialogue with them – even believe that the EU magnifies the negative effects of globalisation; they see how many people – including, alas, many companies – misuse the European Union, enlargement, and globalisation too, as a means of undermining social standards. This is not just a matter of concern in the so-called old Member States, but in the new ones too. It is for that reason that the Commission needs to become more active in the field of social policy; it must help to obviate or at least to alleviate the adverse effects, without fostering the illusion that we can erect a protective wall around Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of my group, then, I urge the Commission to produce a proposal for legislation on, for example, non-standard working arrangements, to unveil – as the Council Presidency has not done – a workable approach to the establishment of a globalisation adjustment fund and, at last, to put on the table a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest, which are among the means whereby the public are connected to the public sector. What they need is support from the European Union and the Commission rather than to be undermined by them.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell the Vice-President of the Commission that the members of my group are not starry-eyed about social issues, but we do know that, if we fail to make this Europe of ours more social, if we fail to give greater prominence to the social dimension in addressing the issues of globalisation and the opening up of markets, then we will fail to win backing for our project from the citizens of this continent. That, though, is an absolute necessity, and for it to happen, we need the Commission’s support. That, speaking on my group’s behalf, is what I really would urge you to provide.</p>

<p class="contents">It is evident from the way we have opted to structure its content that there are tasks to occupy us next year in all policy areas. We congratulate you on the fundamental direction of the work programme, which is aimed at making Europe more competitive, at consistent pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda and at completing the market as a means towards strengthening Europe’s economy – those are the right lines along which to go if Europe is to be made stronger and fitter for globalisation. This policy will also bring Europe closer to its people by making visible what Europe really means for them as individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to make some critical comments. This House is where many political initiatives are started, and the scene of many debates, and we would very much like to see you drawing on our debates as a source for initiatives that eventually bear fruit in legislation. What Europe needs is a single work programme for the various institutions, which would make visible the way in which they work together. The fact is that, at the end of the day, it is we who are the people’s representatives; it is we who take note of what the public in the Member States are talking about and of what they want, and so we ask you to take greater account of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have some critical comments to make about the form of the work programme, which cannot be said to be coherent when it consists of two parts, neither of which has anything to do with the other – an introductory section describing in fine words what Europe is all about, followed by a second part lacking any consistency in either structure or language. A document such as this is comprehensible only to those in the institutions who have to work with it; it is not something with which one can give the public any real idea of what Europe actually intends to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In exactly the same way, we demand of you that, for every initiative that you take, you also specify the legal basis for it, making it possible to trace precisely whence Europe derives the competence to do something in this particular area. It is also advisable to minimise the number of proposals you make, for it often makes much more sense to concentrate on a few things and then do them well.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Better regulation’ is not just about making proposals, but also about implementing them later on. Above all, it must mean implementing them more simply, more quickly and more directly, with priority given to the effects of legislation, which means that greater attention must be given to the costs resulting from it. If it turns out that a piece of legislation will cost too much, and that the costs will outweigh the benefits, then it should be dispensed with. This applies not only to new initiatives, for those that are already going through the system, along with legislation already in force, must also be evaluated in order to determine whether it really is needed or whether it costs too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Working on the principle that less is often more, we have prepared our own proposals, which I ask the Commissioner to draw on, since it is important that the EU should be clear, comprehensible and on a smaller scale if the public are to know what it is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue has an effect on the debate relating to the legislative programme insofar as my group criticised the Commission’s programme, considering that insufficient attention had been paid to the very issues concerning sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Since last month’s debate with Mr Barroso, the European Environment Agency has published a very important and very interesting report, the third five-year report on the state of the environment in the European Union and the effectiveness of the Union’s policies. I am not going to summarise this 750-page report in one and a half minutes, but it is clear that, in spite of the substantial progress made, the overall situation is still deteriorating in a number of sectors, not least in the transport, energy and agricultural sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains – and I wanted to draw your attention to this – two more very important points. Firstly, the fact that the cost of inaction can be higher than the cost of a prevention policy. I was truly surprised to learn that 200 million working days are lost each year due to occupational illnesses connected to air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report states that household expenditure will double between now and 2030. This goes to show the relevance and importance of guiding consumers’ choices and thus of effectively applying the principle of the internalisation of costs. That is why the resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls on you, in particular, to introduce binding measures with regard to car emissions – which are linked to air pollution – to introduce implementing measures in the context of the eco design directive, on which the Commission has fallen behind in comparison with its work programme, and to introduce a tax on aviation fuel as part of a broader fiscal reform that reduces the tax on work and that, as has long been recommended, penalises those products that are harmful to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another aspect included in our resolution is the extension of the scope of the directive on buildings in favour of a more wide-ranging policy on insulation and in favour of better building insulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I would say that, if Bill Clinton declared at Montreal that he was fond of Kyoto, then we, for our part, know that the Commission is very fond of Lisbon. We would hope that the Commission is even fonder of Gothenburg, and I hope that you, in particular, will make your colleagues even fonder of Gothenburg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conference revealed a determination to choose a different development path, focusing on alternative energies and energy savings, and to go down the road of multilateral cooperation, making all that the most important mission for a world caught up in an environmental crisis and the contradictions arising from increasingly marked inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe played an important role in the conference regarding this choice of direction, by holding a dialogue with China on its crucial opening-up and sidelining the Bush Administration’s attempt to sabotage the talks.</p>
<p class="contents">To be frank, there is no significant trace of any of this in the work programme placed before us. President Barroso is proposing free trade and dumping, the Bolkestein directive and the working time directive, and unbridled globalisation leading to increased pollution from transport emissions, which are exceeding all limits.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current situation of crisis and failure, Mr Blair, together with Mr Barroso, is proposing a bare-bones budget and even nuclear power, in contrast to the Montreal conference and those countries, like China, that are calling for renewables, energy savings and clean alternative sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat: these free-trade policies have proved to be a failure. Europe needs a new mission, and it is our duty to find one. It needs social cohesion, innovation, environmental quality, a renewed link between the economy and the regions, cooperation, democracy and peace. A different Europe is not just possible but is becoming increasingly necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Prodi Commission also promised us a comprehensive annual programme, stating the legal basis for every individual piece of draft legislation. The countries also agreed to let the national parliaments check specifically whether the principle of subsidiarity was being observed and have the opportunity of showing the yellow card within six weeks. Moreover, a public debate on the annual programme would then take place in each individual parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Parliament went further and wanted to allow each individual specialist committee to carry out its own check on compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This was almost too good to be true, but then, true to form, the officious centralisers in the Commission made it impossible to read the programme. No national parliaments can assess what is to happen next year. The legal basis has been removed, so it is impossible to see whether the EU is planning a harmless resolution or a binding regulation. The proposals are not arranged according to subject, as in budgets and statute books. The chapters now invented are called prosperity, solidarity and security. All the descriptions have been through an Orwellian office for newspeak, so all future initiatives benefit everyone and inconvenience no one.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, between 2 000 and 4 000 pieces of draft legislation are adopted, but the annual programme has only included 32 such pieces and 64 other proposals in the annual programme. One hundred and eighty-two other pieces of draft legislation and 295 other initiatives have also been mentioned. Why may we not see everything the Commission intends to propose for the coming year? Again, Mr Barosso, let us have a complete and detailed work programme, arranged chapter by chapter and stating the legal basis for each individual proposal. Let us see it set out on the Internet and get the debate under way on what we cannot decide on effectively ourselves and are therefore trying to resolve through the EU or other international fora. That debate is a very practical one, but can only be serious if it is based on the full and unadorned annual programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way in which the accession negotiations with Turkey are being rammed down the European public’s throat, despite their lack of any democratic legitimacy whatever, is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of a second example, it is striking how the Commission rejects the common initiative of members of national parliaments right across the European Union in favour of the systematic testing of legislative proposals by reference to the subsidiarity principle. The Commission regards this system as comparable to nothing other than the familiar yellow-card system for which the European Constitution provided. Consequently, the Commission says that that system, together with the European Constitution, has died a quiet death and that we no longer need to concern ourselves with it. When it does suit the Commission, though, other documents of the former European Constitution secretly resurface and are even made legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the regulation on the Fundamental Rights Agency states that this institution is competent to apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that Member States must respect those fundamental rights when EU law is applied.</p>
<p class="contents">This strange Charter of Fundamental Rights is a kind of Bon Marché or Ikea catalogue that entitles everything and everyone to all manner of things, which makes it a particularly dangerous vehicle. It ought, ordinarily, to have been buried along with the European Constitution, but instead, and by a secret route, the Commission has made it binding. If the Commission would like to do more than pay lip service to strengthening democracy, it will need to fundamentally change its working practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the second time the plenary sitting of the European Parliament has considered the Commission’s 2006 work programme, and I hope that both sides will become a bit wiser as a result of this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the process. I think it is worth recalling that the current Commission sets its objectives over a five-year period, and a single annual work programme cannot encompass everything that we wish to achieve under our mandate. Some things will need to be reserved for inclusion in the work programmes in 2007 and beyond. I remind Members that it is always possible to make an adjustment to the work programme in the mid-term review. This so-called catalogue of additional items, which has been and will be communicated regularly to the European Parliament, contains information on issues of particular concern to Members, which some of you have mentioned today, that are not necessarily addressed in the priority list.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has greatly appreciated the new process of involving committees in identifying priorities and discussing the Commission’s work programme. It is now taking shape in a more serious way, so that we get into the political priorities and have a real political discussion, which will be very helpful in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Swoboda’s remarks, the Commission will discuss the review of the sustainable development strategy in its meeting this afternoon. This represents an integrated approach to the objectives of economic prosperity, environmental standards and social cohesion. This approach is built on the idea that these policy areas are mutually supportive.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to pay full attention to social issues. The work programme includes a green paper on the evolution of labour law, which is expected to launch a wide debate, in which the EU institutions, Member States, social partners and experts will participate. The aim is to establish conclusions about the main trends in the recent evolution of labour law, both at EU and national level. It will also identify the most crucial and urgent issues to be addressed. A communication on social services of general interest is still planned for 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I also underline that the Commission, by giving such priority to the renewed Lisbon Strategy, shows a strong commitment to a Europe of solidarity, accompanied by prosperity and employment. We will continue to put every effort into an effective and credible action by Member States and all stakeholders. Without a collective effort, the strategy on growth and jobs cannot succeed. The credibility of our work depends on detailed preparation, including the necessary consultation of stakeholders and the carrying-out of impact assessments, which I know is also of interest to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to underline the importance of the Commission’s dialogue with the other institutions during the preparation of the 2006 work programme. The many contacts we have had with the European Parliament in the context of the new framework agreement have provided a valuable insight into Parliament’s expectations of the Commission for the coming year. When the work programme was being prepared, Parliament presented the Commission with an important list of priorities. We have also had very constructive contact with the Conference of Presidents in the context of implementing Plan D. I know that both our institutions are committed to realising its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of the comments you have made today on the Commission’s 2006 work programme. The Commission will examine your resolution with great interest and respond accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again mention my appreciation of the fruitful cooperation we have had in 2005. I look forward to building on it in 2006 to make sure that our work programme is implemented with determination and success. I also thank you for the comments on the EEA report, which I was pleased to be able to present. We know the content of that report very well and it has to be taken into account. I think that, when it comes to combating climate change, the Commission is showing leadership on the world scene. I do not see any other partner today playing the same role. Of course, we will continue to strive to ensure the Commission upholds this important role. We will have to lead the way on this particular issue as well.</p>
