<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lechner (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen – and still so many of you here shortly before midnight! In the European internal market, not only do enterprises undertake cross-border economic activities; increasingly they also have assets and branches in several different countries. However, there are losers, as well as winners in the internal market. This is regrettable, but no doubt inevitable. So far there has been little or no regulation of the problems that arise in the event of bankruptcy. For example, what effect does the opening of insolvency proceedings in one Member State have on assets located in another Member State?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">How do matters stand with regard to the debtor’s power of disposal? Is he able to successfully transfer assets, even after the opening of insolvency proceedings; forum shopping as it were? There are neither international law agreements worth mentioning nor European solutions. An agreement was drawn up in 1995, but it did not enter into force. This regulation will mean that these problems will now be regulated by a European legal norm in a comprehensive and conclusive manner, and what is more, it will be directly binding. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the regulation can be described as a big hit and an important step towards unitary and uniform European conflict of laws in matters of insolvency. With this regulation, the competent court of law and applicable law are determined in accordance with the State in which the debtor has the centre of his main interests. Fundamentally, it is this <span class="italic">lex concursus</span> that determines the opening of the insolvency proceedings, the liquidation of the total assets, including those abroad, as well as the participation of foreign creditors, the handling of the procedure and the winding up thereof. The opening of procedures has a direct Europe-wide effect, but the decisions taken at a later stage also have a direct effect, with no need for special acknowledgement procedures in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The regulation is based on the principle of universality and uniformity underlying the procedure. In principle, the debtor’s total assets should be liquidated in one insolvency procedure, which all creditors – domestic as well as foreign – participate in and receive an equal measure of satisfaction from, i.e. it operates on a cross-border basis. In view of the differing national systems of law, for example with regard to security rights or contracts of employment, this principle of universality cannot, however, be upheld throughout. This would infringe the rights of third parties in an inadmissible manner.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, there are a number of significant legal aspects in respect of which special provisions allow for observance of the national law in force in the respective locality. In particular, this applies to rights in rem, immoveable property, rights recorded in public registers, legal institutions such as the reservation of title, set-offs, rights of challenge, and last but not least, contracts of employment. Although these special provisions are irrefutable, the regulation also allows for one or more further insolvency procedures to be conducted in respect of a subsidiary located in another country. Such procedures are then conducted as concurrent or secondary proceedings – termed territorial insolvency procedures – the effect of which, however, is confined to the territory of the country concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, and that expressed in the report, as well as in that of the Committee on Legal Affairs, there are question marks over this. The principle of universality, which, ideally, is inherent in the logic of the internal market and the creation of a uniform legal framework, is thereby interrupted in a way that is not factually irrefutable, unlike in the case of the above-mentioned special provisions. In any event, the same applies to the kind of concurrent proceedings – and this is very important – which are to be instituted following the opening of the main proceedings. In such cases, insolvency proceedings will already have been initiated in respect of the subsidiary at the time of the opening of proceedings in respect of the centre of main interests. For this reason, it is proposed in my report that in cases of this kind, when main proceedings are already under way, further proceedings in the form of concurrent proceedings should only be permitted with the consent of the administrator of the main proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This qualification would constitute another important step in the direction of a closed, uniform, European legal system. As a matter of fact, the opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also took this line, and other opinions are against having more than one set of proceedings. They would create additional complications and delimitation problems. It is not so much the facts of the matter that have given rise to this proposal, as the pressures attending the search for a unanimous compromise. I believe Parliament should shift its emphasis here and would therefore urge those who have tabled amendments on this point to give it further thought.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Further proposals concern clarifications, for example with regard to safeguarding the independence of legal persons and other matters. On a final note, I would like to say a word of thanks to Finland and Germany, who are to be commended for initiating the proposal. This regulation lays down all conflict of law provisions in insolvency law in a compact, conclusive and binding manner, as a European legal norm, whilst upholding national systems of law in the matter. This represents a breakthrough and could be held up as an example in my view. Hence I would urge the Council to adopt the regulation as quickly as possible, taking Parliament’s proposals into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zimeray (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created. We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts. The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union. We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method. When you observe – and you cannot fail to do so – the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed. The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany. The second way is to recreate a law <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the route that has been taken. The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty. This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for. But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice. It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects. And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in many Member States, that is not possible. One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here. I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies. </p>
<p class="contents">I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard. I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report. I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council. I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it. </p>
<p class="contents">To the rapporteur’s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors’ legal position and impairs their legal protection. With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then. We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee. </p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life. It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable. This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues. The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention. As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission’s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues. The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission’s opinions on the amendments under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4. Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC. Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of “centre of the debtor’s main interests”. With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3. In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
