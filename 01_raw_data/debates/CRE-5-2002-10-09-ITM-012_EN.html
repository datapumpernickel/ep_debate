<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – I am privileged to present this report on behalf of my colleague from the Fisheries Committee, Michael Holmes. Members may be aware that Mr Holmes recently underwent major surgery and I am sure that the House will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I congratulate Mr Holmes on his excellent work in compiling this report. We are dealing with this issue against a background of collapsing fish stocks throughout the European Union. Indeed, at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the issue of over-fishing in international waters was recognised by countries around the world. They committed themselves to limiting fishing to sustainable levels and to taking steps to restore fish stocks by 2015, a position fully supported by Commissioner Fischler. Indeed, he expressed the view that the EU should achieve these targets long before that date and he pledged decisive action against illegal and unregulated fisheries practices.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I find it bizarre and even astonishing that the Commission agreed to a Council compromise last June which effectively paves the way for a total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to be applied to deepwater stocks. Although this was judged by Mr Arias Cañete, the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council at that time, to be one of the highlights of the Spanish Presidency, it requires closer examination.</p>
<p class="contents">The science in relation to deep-sea stocks is not yet fully developed. However, we know that these fish live at great depths – over 1 200 metres – and we know that they are slow-maturing, not reaching breeding age until they are at least 25 years old. We also know that they have a very low reproductive capacity, and that there are around 87 different species of fish swimming together at these great depths, of which only around eight are edible or marketable. As a result, we know that fishermen in these waters regularly dump around 90% of all the fish they catch, dead, back into the sea. Out of every 100 tonnes of fish caught, 90 tonnes are being thrown back dead into the water.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying TACs and quotas to these deepwater stocks for the first time, as Mr Holmes points out forcefully in his report, will invite disaster. TACs and quotas are the root cause of the two million tonnes of good, fresh fish which are currently dumped dead into the sea every year in the EU. TACs and quotas only control what is landed, they do not control what is caught. If this House votes tomorrow for the application of TACs and quotas to these deepwater stocks, then I can predict with some confidence that this valuable fishery will be destroyed perhaps within as little as five years.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Holmes report points out, the only way to regulate this fishery in a sustainable way is by effort limitation, by limiting the number of days during which a vessel may put to sea. If a fishing boat is not at sea, then it is not fishing and if it is not fishing, then the fish are not being caught. This is the only logical and realistic approach to achieving a sustainable deepwater fishery. That is why this is also the approach favoured by the scientists and by the fishing communities on whose future the survival of these stocks depends.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is essential that we apply strict controls to the type of gear being used in these deepwater fisheries. Gill nets are strung out at huge depths on the sea bed, sometimes stretching for up to 100 kilometres, and are then left anchored for days at a time while the parent fishing vessel returns to port. They can cause massive damage to these highly vulnerable species. Sometimes, these nets can also break loose and continue ghost-fishing for decades. These nets should be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, rock hoppers which bounce across obstacles on the seabed to avoid nets becoming snagged can cause enormous damage to delicate corals and sea mounts which are an essential part of the marine ecosystem. We cannot allow such unsustainable practices to continue unchecked. Needless to say, these ideas are not favoured by those Member States whose attitude to fishing is based on a short-term, dash-for-profit philosophy. They have no concern for the marine environment, for sustainability, nor for the massive socio-economic impact which will result if we allow these fisheries to collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge this House to accept the amended proposals recommended by Mr Holmes in his report and I commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by warmly congratulating Mr Holmes on his report. Expert opinion is as one in confirming that deep-sea stocks are at present heavily overfished, and the pressure on fisheries continues to increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Stocks of deep-sea fish are, however, very sensitive in biological terms, as they have a very low breeding rate and grow very slowly – substantially more slowly than other types of fish. It therefore takes many years before deep-sea stocks that have been too heavily fished are able to recover. The opinions that we have received also state that TACs and quotas can be only a first step towards protecting deep-sea species. Experts also urge that the fishing effort should be restricted and new methods developed, principally for the collection of data relating to these stocks. That is why we have also submitted a proposal for licences, for effort limitation and the collection of data, and this proposal, taken as a whole, rests on four central pillars. Firstly, we need better flow of information from the fishermen to the scientists. Secondly, we have to introduce better supervision in order to get more reliable data. Thirdly, we have to be more vigilant in monitoring the landing of deepwater species and provide for fishing vessels to be monitored with the aid of satellites. Fourthly, we have to introduce a freeze on fishing licences for deep-sea species to keep them at the present level and prevent any further increase of the pressure on fishery. As a whole, we have to gain better knowledge of deep sea fishing and improve the stocks. Only then will we be able to enact fair and appropriate regulations. So I hope that Parliament will endorse these measures. I would like to wait until after the debate to say something about the amendments and let you know what position the Commission takes on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Leaving irony aside, however, I shall say that these species of fish living away from the continental shelves are precious and are part of the rich diversity of marine life. We all agree, furthermore, that it is crucial to protect these species, these population units, from the heightened exploitation to which they have been subject in the last few years. In fact, the scarcity of fish on the continental shelf and in the major fishing grounds has caused many vessels and many fishermen to turn to these species that have survived or that have been largely ignored until now, and which are, consequently, on the way to suffering total despoliation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, absolutely crucial to protect these fish species and we also all agree that scientific research is essential since there is still a great deal we do not know about these species because they are, shall we say, rather mysterious, like everything from the deep, like everything from afar. Much more research must be carried out on observing these population units, their ecosystems, their living and reproductive habits and their fertility rates, because there are major fears that since these species’ growth rates are slow, they are much more vulnerable to the exploitation to which they are subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is agreement on the diagnosis and on the shortcomings of the research carried out to date, there seems to be some disagreement about the methodology with which to protect these species, as far as I could understand from Commissioner Fischler’s intervention. Nevertheless, I do not see how we can avoid the need for total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – the old methodology, which produced some results, although it has its limitations; nor do I see how we can avoid limiting fishing efforts. I know that this is a very sensitive matter, because nowadays, the activity of fishermen, fishing communities and investments clearly always take priority. In this case, however, the precautionary principle must be applied. Where we cannot be certain, we must be cautious and prudent. Consequently, we must do everything that can be done, even though we cannot be certain about the result and the efficiency of this action, to protect these fish species, these dozens and dozens of species, the habits of some of which may even be unknown or almost unknown. I therefore congratulate the Commission and Mr Holmes on their work, because this work is crucial to the protection of nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Holmes for his work and join in wishing him a speedy recovery. The ELDR firmly believes that there is an urgent need to regulate this fishery. Available scientific evidence on deep-water species suggests that they are outside safe biological limits and that measures should be introduced to allow rebuilding of the stocks. Action is particularly essential in light of the fact that these fish live a long time, grow slowly and have low reproductive capacity. The majority of the amendments made by the committee seek to exempt ling and tusk from the scope of the regulation, although they would still be covered by quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the group accepts that these two species are caught on the continental shelf, it is imperative that they are properly regulated. If these amendments are adopted by Parliament, the ELDR will vote against the proposal as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 5, the ELDR believes that kilowatt fishing days are a more accurate tool to measure effort in view of the so-called technological creep and so cannot support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, favourable to Amendment No 6 which requests a review of the progress being made in achieving the aims of the regulation. The ELDR has tabled three amendments of its own. Amendment No 8 calls for an economic and operational impact assessment in relation to the expected loss of revenue and effort displacement resulting from the implementation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 seeks to outlaw the use of fixed gill nets in this fishery as they risk inflicting substantial unintended mortality on heavily depleted stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 10 proposes the use of area closures to protect species which accumulate particularly densely in certain areas at certain times of the year. The ELDR is also minded to support Amendments Nos 12 and 16 by Mr Hudghton and others on greater involvement by the fishing industry and on safety respectively. It has, however, doubts as to whether fishing effort control should be the sole management tool and therefore also has doubts about Amendments Nos 11 and 14.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR is concerned that Amendment No 13 may delay the implementation of the management measures and also believes that Amendment No 15 could potentially have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal level, however, I feel that regulation of catch opportunities in a mixed fishery by means of both TACs and quotas and an effort regime, based on licences, will lead to the discarding of species for which a quota is not held or where the quota has been exceeded. For this reason, I shall support Amendments Nos 11 and 14. I will also support Amendment No 15 as it represents a fairer basis for the distribution of quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express, on behalf of the ELDR, a profound dissatisfaction that the Council has effectively taken a decision on this dossier without awaiting the opinion of Parliament.

<p class="contents">When the Commission's proposals first appeared, we, in the Green Party, welcomed them. It was high time that these newly-developed fisheries for deepwater species were brought under some sort of control. We are all aware of why these species are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation, as Mr Stevenson pointed out in his introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">As the stocks in EU waters which were the traditional target of EU vessels were becoming depleted, the result was the development of these new fisheries. At the same time, we feel that the conclusions of the negotiations over the detail of the management regime put in place are much too weak. They are also too dependent upon TACs and quotas which have proved such a disaster elsewhere, as Mr Stevenson pointed out. We hope that now that a management regime is put in place, the Commission will act quickly to strengthen it – for instance by other means, such as much stronger technical measures and more restrictive effort controls. This is what will be effective in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the move that led to the proposal for a regulation that we are debating this evening is exemplary and deserves thorough consideration when it comes to updating the common fisheries policy. Around fifteen years ago, the French fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer began fishing for and selling certain species of fish living beyond the continental shelf in the deep trench, which is more than 800 metres deep. It was at the request of these professional fishermen that a scientific research institute, Ifremer, started to take a close interest in the biology of these species and particularly in their biological cycle. A fruitful collaboration between professionals and scientists enabled them to determine quite early on that these species have slow life cycles and that there was an urgent need for catches to be limited so as not to endanger their biological balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Also at the request of the professionals, supported in their action by the scientists, the government of the main Member State concerned, France, asked the Commission to take action to regulate these new fishing grounds by establishing TACs and quotas. The Commission was reluctant for a long time and dragged its heels. Without the political agreement reached at the Fisheries Council of last June, it is unlikely that we would now have these two proposals for regulations on fishing deep-water stocks. Finally, however, we do have them and I welcome both them and the report by Michael Holmes, who has addressed this issue with great competence and whom I too wish a speedy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which these regulations have come to exist is exemplary for more than one reason. It illustrates first of all the fact that fishermen are of course the main people concerned and the main actors when it comes to establishing rules for sustainable fishing. It also shows that the instruments best suited to providing the effective protection of fish species are those which are flexible and reversible, such as TACs and quotas, and not rigid structural measures with irreversible effects such as the destruction of vessels or the retraining of fishermen. It also shows that fishermen and scientists can work together closely and intelligently and come up with proposals for realistic and constructive management measures which allow fishing to take place whilst at the same time managing resources. Lastly, it demonstrates that an upwards action rising from the field level to the competent authority is more effective than the downwards and even condescending action usually favoured, unfortunately, by the Commission, not least when it launched the draft reform of the CFP. These lessons must therefore be carefully retained and implemented, if possible, within the entire process of reforms underway.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I think that we can only welcome the fact that we have achieved this regulation and I shall be supporting the report by Michael Holmes as well as most of his amendments, which have the support of the fishermen concerned, particularly those calling for the re-examination of the provision every three years in order to update the results obtained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, then, could the Commission support such a regime? How could the Council endorse such a scheme in June 2002 without proper consultation with the industry and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Council being left out of the picture?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a lot to answer for in this, but the main appeal that I make at this stage is not for recrimination but for the proposal to be reconsidered. If conservation of stocks is to be achieved, we must regulate deep-sea fisheries under a regime based on effort limitation. We must take into account firstly that TACs will increase mortality through discards of the species most in the need of protection, and secondly, that safety could be put at risk as vessels with inadequate quota but a deficit in fishing days would be pressurised to fish under perilous conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge this House and also the Commission to support the amendments in the name of the ELDR Group and those in my name which are signed by various members of the four largest groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the social and economic implications of any final proposal must be fully assessed and measured for compensation provided where appropriate and without discrimination between fishermen in different Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must say in all frankness that there is also no truth in the assertion that no scientific evaluation exists. A scientific opinion has been given by ICES, and also by our scientific advisory forum. There is indeed no lack of scientific foundation for what we are doing!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the various amendments, which I would like to evaluate in the light of the debate. The first amendment is one that the Commission can accept. I agree that ling, tusk and red spot seabream should be taken out of the scope of the regulation, although these fish should remain on the list of species for which detailed information on catches is required. I can also accept Amendments Nos 2 and 4, but not Amendment No 3, as I am against removing the supplementary provisions on satellite surveillance from our proposal, our practical experience with the satellite system having shown that failures are often not real failures at all, but are simulated in order to circumvent the surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, traditional monitoring with patrol vessels and aircraft is far from adequate to deal with deep sea fishing, especially in very distant areas; indeed, it is not even a workable proposition. We therefore need effective monitoring by satellite, and we must tighten up the definition of an equipment failure and the consequences resulting from one. I am happy to take on board the addition to Amendment No 5 to the effect that fishing days should be days out of port; that is a useful clarification, but the reference to catch areas is less clear than our proposal that the exact ICES statistical rectangle should be indicated. I am therefore unwilling to accept it. Considerations of confidentiality lead me to consider it inappropriate to publicise the identification of individual vessels for scientific studies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand that the measurement of engine power in kilowatts is problematic and difficult to enforce. Instead, then, of deleting the reference to capacity, which is necessary to scientific analysis, we want to improve the reference by, for example, specifying the classes of vessels, which can be summarised by reference to gross registered tonnage.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 is, in my view, a good idea, and I am willing to provide for revision of the measures in 2005. I can also go along with Amendment No 7, but not with Amendment No 8. The Commission, in any case, has consultations as a matter of routine with the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries on the social and economic consequences of conservation measures, but I am quite happy to accept Article 9a and submit to the Council and to Parliament, by 30 June 2005, a report on the general arrangements for the management of deepwater species, which would also cover the scientific dimension of a reduction in fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 9 as at present drafted, as no scientific evaluations have been submitted to us demanding a ban on fixed gillnets, but I will take up your suggestion in this regard and ask ICES for a scientific evaluation of whether and for which areas such a ban on fixed gillnets might be a sensible conservation measure. I can agree to Amendment No 10. I have to reject Amendment No 11; although it is the case that the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommends a reduction in the fishing effort for deepwater species, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries regards additional TACs as a useful supplementary measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to accept Amendment No 12, but the Commission has to reject Amendment No 13 on the grounds that it would go against the precautionary principle. We must act as soon as we get scientific advice for the first time. The same is true of Amendment No 14, which I cannot accept either. In order to implement in practice an effort limitation, we need deep-sea fishing licences. I regret that I also have to turn down Amendment No 15. We are all aware that the deep sea fishing fleet has rapidly increased in power and capacity. If we were to change the reference period, we would be permitting a de facto further increase in the size of the deep sea fleet, which however does not at all fit in with the effort limitations that are urgently necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have no option but to reject the final amendment, No 16, as well, as this amendment would make possible derogations from the regulation that would be impossible to monitor, the things termed ‘force majeure’ or ‘risk to the safety of vessels’ being concepts lacking any definition in law. Of course safety has to be guaranteed – there can be no question whatever about that. The provisions we have now also allow a ship at risk to dock in a port other than that designated, provided that it does not land its catch there. I believe this approach to be already balanced and to take the safety of ships sufficiently into account, as well as the enforceable provisions on conservation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
