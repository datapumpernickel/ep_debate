Unfortunately, this evening I am not going to be able to tell you anything positive on either of these two subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Serbia: I will start with the latest news. As you know, there are currently around one million people on the streets of Belgrade and the news that we are getting is that tension is mounting.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the European Union, I think that the decision taken by the Constitutional Court is, once again, a violation of all the basic principles of a country that should have free elections. The resolution passed by the Constitutional Court meant, once again, taking away the votes of citizens who have voted freely and obtained a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you, on behalf of the European Union and the Council, that we consider Professor Kostunica to be the leader of the majority of the Serbian people and that it is him who we are going to support and continue to support. We believe that he has won the elections, that his people were capable of winning the elections and that he is the one who deserves all of our support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will not hide from you the fact that the situation is not easy, and that we are going to experience a certain degree of tension in the next few days, but everyone needs to keep calm so that the situation does not develop into a serious conflict. I would also like to tell you that the European Union has put mechanisms in place so that, once the popular will of the Serbian people is respected, that is, once we have a government that is supported by the people who voted in the ballot boxes for Mr Kostunica, we can offer two things: firstly, an immediate lifting of sanctions and secondly, a package of economic aid that can help the Serbian people to rebuild their economy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an important matter that I would also like to mention to you, which I have had the opportunity to discuss with Mr Kofi Annan, with whom I met for three hours this morning. As you know, there is still the problem of which state is to succeed the former Republic of Yugoslavia. This is a problem that has not been resolved and, until it is resolved, the international financial institutions – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – will not be able to help democratic Serbia. Therefore, we also need to work within the United Nations with the countries of the former Yugoslavia in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible which, when Serbia becomes free, could unblock economic aid through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say – as you know – that the Presidency has organised a summit in Zagreb, which we hope will be a summit in which a democratic former Republic of Yugoslavia takes part, and that we want to include all the countries in building a Balkans region that is stable, prosperous, with a European outlook and with its eyes on the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is what I can tell you at the moment. I am sure that if the sitting goes on for some time that we will have more information. But I do say to you – and I think that we have to continue to be firm about this – that President Milosevic robbed his people of their freedom. This is what we must say and we must do everything we can to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You have asked me to give you information on the latest events in the Middle East, and unfortunately, in this case I am also unable to give you optimistic news. I can give you news of optimism of will, but not really of optimism of intelligence. The situation is not easy. Everyone needs to make an effort so that the tension is reduced in that area, which is so important to us, and so that negotiations take place once again, or so that the parties involved return to the negotiating table. For those of us who have had the very powerful experience of taking part in a great number of meetings over the summer, which resulted in the two sides coming much closer together than they ever have, it is all the more sad still to be seeing people and families torn apart and people suffering and dying in the streets of those countries that we are so fond of.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you that yesterday, the French Presidency – led by the President of the Republic – the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mrs Albright, and I spent the whole day trying to reach an agreement that both parties could sign. All our efforts were in vain. No agreement has been signed. There is an agreement that has not even been initiated, and negotiations are currently continuing in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Prime Minister Barak did not attend the meeting, and although there is this agreement, which has not been formalised, the situation in the territories is a little better. I must tell you and admit to you that no agreement has yet been signed on any of the issues. There is a draft agreement on the withdrawal of some of the military forces. There are the beginnings of an agreement on the tripartite committee that could analyse the future of security in the area, but there has been no agreement at all on a committee to investigate the causes of and responsibilities for the events.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to make an appeal from this institution to everyone involved and, in particular, to the political leaders involved to make every effort to reduce the tension and, as quickly as possible, to return to the negotiating table, because their positions are not so different that they cannot come to an agreement. But, once again, we are seeing the depth of the crisis that still exists in that part of the world, which is so important to us. Let us hope that in the next few hours I will be able to give you better news. Unfortunately, at the moment I cannot do so.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, High Representative, honourable Members. I agree with the High Representative’s observations on the situation in the Middle East and on the situation in Belgrade. Allow me to start by saying a few words on Serbia. During the elections on 24 September, the Serbian people ousted Milosevic and his regime. The Serbian people voted clearly in favour of a new beginning with new political leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always made it clear that the Serbian people have as much right to be in Europe as any of the other people of Europe. We have always made it clear that we would radically revise our policy towards Serbia if the Serbian people voted at the elections in favour of the opposition and, hence, democratic change. We made it clear – and I should like to reaffirm this – that any decision in favour of democratic change would also be a decision to return to Europe. There is not the shadow of a doubt that this message was heard in Serbia and the Serbian people have cast their vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The victory has been won, although the regime has made and continues to make huge efforts to forestall it. The question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hours on the streets of Belgrade. Allow me to say loud and clear: Europe unreservedly supports the democratic opposition in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share its burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts, who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many, both in Serbia and in several other countries. As soon as the will of the people is respected – and it will be, of that I have no doubt – what has happened in Serbia will create an opportunity for real, lasting peace in the Balkans. It will give the Serbian people the chance to rejoin the European family of nations and to build a peaceful and stable future together with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Serbian people bring about democratic change – and the European Union promised this a long time ago – the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will enjoy the same benefits as its neighbours and the European Union will maintain the same relations with it. We must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Solana has already indicated – and I can confirm that the Commission is already working on reconstruction aid for the Serbian economy and infrastructure – this aid will come to fruition as soon as a democratic government is in office. We are prepared to lift sanctions and provide emergency aid against the harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission commented last week that this is an immense task which we must tackle immediately and without delay, as soon as the will of the people is respected. I think that the signal which this debate sends to Belgrade today will be decisive. The message which Parliament must send can only be to urge Milosevic one more time, perhaps for the last time, to see the writing on the wall, step down and pave the way for democratic change in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few comments on the dramatic and rapid developments in the Middle East. We feel deep sorrow and sympathy for the numerous victims. It is mainly Palestinians who have fallen victim to the conflicts which have re-ignited over the last few days. We cannot be harsh enough in condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force. We condemn any action which deserves to be seen as provocation, especially in connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome and support the efforts being made by President Chirac, President Mubarak and Secretary of State Albright and can only hope that the supreme objective of ending the violence and restoring peace and order will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the committee of enquiry, the Commission supports the Presidency’s stance. Obviously, this crisis may have dangerous repercussions on the peace process. We share this concern. Nonetheless – and I take the same view here as Mr Solana – it would be premature to consider that agreement between Israel and Palestine is now out of the question. The window of opportunity will be open until the end of October. After that, the stability of Prime Minister Barak’s government will be in jeopardy and there will be tremendous pressure on President Arafat to declare statehood.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak, President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our job to convince Israel that recognising and respecting the rights of the Palestinians, with all the compromises which that implies, is the best way of safeguarding its long-term national interests. Israel’s long-term interests lie in lasting peace. We must convince the Palestinians that the best way of achieving their objectives and safeguarding their rights is to negotiate with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reaffirm that the European Union supports the peace process because it is the only mechanism which can make the only possible alternative for Israel and the Palestinian people come true. Fair, comprehensive peace, even if it means painful compromises on both sides. However complicated the issues may be, the parties must grab the historic chance which they now have. Anything else would be an awful tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations should build on the progress made in Camp David in July. This progress was not directly tangible, to be sure, because the summit as a whole was not successful. But nor was Camp David a failure, because the gulf between the parties was clearly narrowed and some serious taboos were overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s stand on the substance of the peace process has not changed. We support the parties in negotiating an agreement in keeping with the principles and references of the peace process set in motion in Madrid. We are convinced that a compromise can be found on all the points at issue. We are also prepared to make a contribution and provide help. If, as we hope, the parties manage to conclude an agreement, the European Union will add its political and financial support to the efforts being made by others on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden and will meet the parties’ demands to a reasonable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to work on securing stability in the region and, in the long term, on safeguarding the permanent welfare of the region through sustainable economic growth and an improved standard of living, so that the people in the region can reap the benefits of peace. This philosophy is in complete accord with a stronger Barcelona Europe-Mediterranean process and we shall continue our efforts within the context of that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have agreed to be spokesperson for the Group of the European People’s Party because, like my colleagues in the group, I think it is essential to ask the Council, the Commission and you, Mr Solana, to spare no effort – you have just committed yourself to that – to help restart negotiations to secure the peace so long awaited throughout the world, in Europe, but especially there, on the spot.</p>
<p class="contents">I know from experience that it is a lot more difficult for an army to win peace than a war. I know that the transition from fighting to peacekeeping requires troops who are capable, not of unleashing violence from their weapons in the conquest of an objective, but of controlling that violence. That requires special training, standard now for soldiers in European Union armies, because we are lucky enough to be at peace. The forces of Israel and Palestine are not so lucky. It is up to us to take our place beside the United Nations and the United States of America and, in close cooperation with them, to continue tirelessly supporting all those who have the determination to succeed at the price of the necessary concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">And I have one question, Mr Solana: surely the time has come for an intelligent and courageous initiative by the European Union on the status of Jerusalem? We all know that is the crux of the matter and we have not forgotten the interesting proposals we have heard on this subject in this very Chamber, which deserve our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to face up to and shoulder our responsibilities as the European Union, not only regarding the problems that we are dealing with, but also regarding the major issues of world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We can discuss how we organise ourselves, because we are creating something new, but there is a common affirmation, which is precisely that we need a real Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we have the Belgrade Parliament in flames – we know what setting a Parliament on fire means in the context of European history, and we know the responsibility held by leaders that lead their people to disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in this sense – not that Milosevic is going to listen – we have to reiterate that we are not against the Serbian people. We are against the leaders who have surely led them to the greatest disaster in their history.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And we have to offer them our hand in a very symbolic way – as Mr Solana said – with this meeting in Zagreb. There we can really see the change that takes place when a country’s democracy is consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, as Europeans we have made an effort – Venice, Madrid, Oslo, Stockholm – and we have given real support to the promotion and progress of this process. We should not allow the leaders who wish to radicalise the process and the extremist forces to drive it towards disaster, particularly based on a symbolic provocation in one of the most sacred places in the world, an issue we discussed last month in the debate on the future of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to reiterate, however, that as Europeans we are not only prepared to provide economic aid. We want to fully shoulder our responsibilities and, above all, to do so at a time when what is needed is to reduce the tension, to bring both sides back to the table in order to find a balanced solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a commitment that we need to reiterate today, unanimously, and I urge the Secretary of the Council, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission not to give up on their efforts and to express this unanimous will of all the peoples and all the representatives of the European Union.</p>

Like others, I also want to express my concern about what is happening and, at the same time, say that, whenever this area is talked about, the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of its not taking very much to provoke a reaction, almost no matter what is said. I too, however, must urge both the Commissioner and Mr Solana to do everything in their powers to press for the successful achievement of a ceasefire agreement, so that the bloody events in question might be brought to an end. If that does not happen, a chain reaction might be triggered, in other countries too, which might prove to be uncontrollable. A minor example of this is the events that took place yesterday in Copenhagen when a peaceful demonstration turned violent. Happily, no-one was killed as a result, but unfortunately a number of people were injured. What we in the EU must and shall do, therefore, is continue talking in terms of negotiation, negotiation and, again, negotiation, so that those windows which are now open do not close before we have achieved a result. A peace agreement is needed now. Otherwise, there is a strong possibility of things ending in disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that basis, I would like to make three observations. Firstly, I would like to comment on Mr Sharon’s provocation on Thursday. It was clear from the outset that the issue was one of internal party-politics, namely the battle between Sharon and Netanyahu. In my view, what is far more damaging is the fact that this provocation was condoned by Prime Minister Barak, who, in my view, either made the huge mistake of wrongly gauging the implications of Mr Sharon’s visit, or made a conscious attempt to bring the whole situation to a head.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to turn to the disturbances at the Al Aqsa Mosque on Friday. The next day, I talked to various people who visited that Mosque and it is really incomprehensible that various men in their fifties and sixties – i.e. not those throwing the stones – were shot at in the Mosque. Talking of provocation, I find it extremely shocking that the Israeli Government should shoot people who were praying in the Mosque on Temple Mount on the Holy Day of the Muslims, and I believe that the international community was entirely justified in its condemnation of the incident.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment concerns a visit to the hospital in Eastern Jerusalem the next day. In fact, I have quite a few observations regarding that visit. I found it extremely shocking to see that during the disturbances, an ambulance driver was shot. In another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes, an ambulance driver was shot in the foot from a ten centimetre range as he was trying to come to the rescue of some people. The most shocking of all is the fact that the Israeli police and the army used fragmentation bullets. These are bullets which, upon contact with the body, shatter into dozens of pieces. They are banned internationally, even in battles amongst soldiers; yet they are now used against citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is that the Israeli Government has applied excessive force which has been widely condemned, and rightly so. My question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following: what could the European Union do in very concrete terms in order, first of all, to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances, and secondly, to bring the peace process back on track? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eight years on from the signing of the peace agreements, the army still occupies over 80 % of the territories.</p>
<p class="contents">The settlers have opened fire. How can we describe these new massacres and this Palestinian rebellion. More stone-throwing youths? It is more than that. The Palestinian security forces are also firing. The explosion had been brewing for months: it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settlers has grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements; when you cannot find work to support your children, which is the case of my friend Talal who works as a builder in the settlements, maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family; it is difficult when the soldiers stop you from moving around. Ariel Sharon was the catalyst but the responsibility also lies with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldiers firing on the crowd.</p>
<p class="contents">While condemning all forms of violence, we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence. On the one hand, there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international laws and, on the other, there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation. This is not the work of Hamas: it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leaders and decision-makers. It is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brothers but demanding to be treated as citizens with full rights and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">We must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations: the fighting must cease, the Israeli soldiers must be withdrawn, there must be an international inquiry, at which Europe must be present, and the Palestinian people must be protected. It would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions, starting with resolutions 338, 242 and 194 on the return of refugees to their homes, apply. This would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel's – by now – firm conviction that it can always do whatever it likes with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us, as are the Israelis themselves who, together with the Palestinians, are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence. But the rights of the Palestinian State are no less important. In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute. It is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but rights have to be respected, and here rights are not being respected. It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions; we must enforce the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest reports I have received – and I regret I may have to leave Parliament to go to Paris immediately – are that the parliament building has been taken over by the demonstrators in Belgrade and the television building is now in the hands of the opposition. The situation in the central part of Belgrade is extraordinary, and we may be very close to the last moments of a regime, as the British Foreign Secretary said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Parliament at this critical hour to issue a statement of support for the brave people who have, today, defended freedom and liberty in the streets of Belgrade, echoing the support which we Europeans gave not many years ago to sustain those people in other capitals who were also fighting for their freedom.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, the bloody confrontations which have taken place in the last few days in Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel are particularly serious, because of the high numbers of victims and also because they have brought renewed talk of exclusion as regards the State of Israel, talk that we thought belonged to the past and which is dangerously irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence, the unacceptable provocation, the disproportionate reaction against the Palestinian people must not become a pretext for questioning the fundamental right of both peoples, Israeli and Palestinian, to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood. Some of the statements that have been made – here, even, and elsewhere – are disturbing. They are not likely to make negotiations any easier, quite the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of the last few days demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is. So we must do everything possible to douse the fire as quickly as possible. The only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talks and Mr Solana, who has just left us, is right to concentrate his efforts in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">And here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States, France and Egypt in particular. The main lesson to be drawn from these grave troubles, the source of which has been Jerusalem, and more specifically the Temple Mount and the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound, is that as long as the negotiations on Jerusalem and in particular on the Holy Places are put off, peace cannot be definitely assured. It is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy Places.</p>
<p class="contents">So, negotiations should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive areas neutral, and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie? As you will remember, he told us that the major differences over Jerusalem lay at the heart of the failure of Camp David, and made the following proposal, with particular reference to UN Resolution 181, and I quote: “we Palestinians agree that both parts of Jerusalem, East and West, should be a unified Jerusalem, an international Jerusalem, and it should not be the capital of Israel and Palestine alone, but of the whole world.”. I think this avenue ought to be explored as soon as possible, because until the Jerusalem question is resolved, it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontations likely to degenerate in the same way as the tragic events we are currently witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The evidence seems to be that the State of Israel has no intention, and never has had any intention, of negotiating seriously with Palestine and granting it all the powers of a sovereign and independent nation.</p>
<p class="contents">The State of Israel sees many advantages in this situation of latent conflict and does not hesitate to make use of them. Whatever the alleged good intentions of certain Israeli leaders, nothing has really changed for the Palestinians. Colonisation of the occupied territories is increasing. The economic dependence of Palestine is increasing. Access to the Muslim Holy Places is being made more and more difficult. The Palestinian leaders are in a no-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, they either accept perpetual talks, generally under the auspices of the United States, and endorse the expansionist policy of the State of Israel or, with the aid of other Muslim countries and their traditional friends, they create a new and more favourable balance of power. This new balance of power calls, in particular, for the immediate proclamation of a Palestinian State, the use of oil as a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a situation requires tact. Provocations such as those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon, must be refrained from. However, violence is not a legitimate response to provocation, and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not. If the European Union wants to be a reliable partner in the peace process, it will have to unequivocally condemn provocations and calls for violent action. To this end, my group has tabled two amendments to the resolution to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence as a possible tool in the negotiations. It is heartrending if children are sacrificed in a battle which should be settled around the negotiating table. The position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations. I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line: pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The horrifying pictures of children running for cover being killed and of civilians being fired at from tanks and helicopters give us just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides, Israel and Palestine, if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process as quickly as possible. That is the most important aspect at the moment, not apportioning blame and condemnation. The European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not prepared – as I have been urged on several occasions, purely in order to appear fair – to refrain from calling the events of the last few days by their proper name or from making the same demands on both sides, as if the provocation and force were divided equally between them. Or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there? Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw its tanks and helicopters from Israeli towns and villages and stop firing on civilian Israelis? Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli children cowering behind walls and trying to take cover behind barrels? I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness. But I am prepared to call on my fellow members in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation as provocation and not as counter-productivity, as Mrs Albright said, in order to gloss things over, purely to appear fair towards both sides. In this respect, I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, there is confusion between, on the one hand, a democratic State doing its best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and, on the other, the institution at the heart of Palestine which, under provocation certainly, immediately takes up arms to shoot at the Israeli forces of order. That is happening again today, and that is what will prevent, and has prevented Europe from acting as mediator in the Middle East all these years, leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding Serbia, I would like to tell Mr Barón Crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject, given that throughout the previous parliament his group was willing to go to any lengths to block any action designed to bring Milosevic to justice, and when a majority was achieved it was not with the support of the Socialist Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course difficult, as events unfold in Belgrade, to sit here calmly and give a speech which was prepared before all this came to pass. I expected today’s events to take place last Monday. We all know that the people have stormed Parliament, that the television station, which has been fully occupied by the army, has been stormed and that army vehicles and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade. We can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police – all of whom are essentially there to serve the people, not a dictator such as Milosevic – will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since democracy raised its head again in Serbia last Monday, the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility. The results of the elections on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible. I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it: the democratic opposition and, most importantly, the people and the leader of the democratic organisation, Mr Kostunica. I think that, in him, we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concerns and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 24 September, Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler. Everyone, including his own citizens in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator, who is using all the brutal, ugly and contemptuous instruments of dictatorship in his own country. Special police units, dirty tricks and deception, quasi-legal procedures which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him.</p>
<p class="contents">He has managed for years, with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media, to deceive the people in his own country and, unfortunately, many in the western world, to whom he has misrepresented the real situation. At last, all that is at an end. The people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic has no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime. Which is why we must support Serbia in its bid for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for years now and who are familiar with the situation in the region, know how difficult the fight against authoritarian rulers and tyrants in most of these countries was and, in places, still is. Sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our views and our way of thinking, which do not fit in with their traditions and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contacts in Serbia, who may well not understand us immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us, partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural differences which I have mentioned. I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulties in communicating with the newly elected president as a sign of irreconcilable differences between us and the advocates of democracy in Serbia. There are no such differences. We can help them on the path to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start packages through at long last, then we must do more than just talk. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions, because these sanctions have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer. Please help us to give the people a glimmer of hope, with Kostunica, so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia.</p>

We are delighted to hear that the people of Yugoslavia, mainly in Belgrade but also in other towns, have known how to take their fate into their own hands and have done so. However, our delight is tainted with fear that there may be bloodshed, that not everyone wants to and can accept the voice, power and strength of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed, because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a veritable disaster. Mr Dupuis, you have abused this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy. I have only one thing to say to you: my group and I are unequivocally in favour of bringing Milosevic to justice before the court in the Hague. That has always been our objective; but we have a still higher objective, which is to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed is avoided. The Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives, because that would mean that perhaps thousands of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them. Secondly, we are in a very delicate position and, therefore, we too trust that there will be fast changes in Yugoslavia and Serbia, because the situation is not easy in either Montenegro or Kosovo. Here, too, I have one thing to say: we have supported the efforts with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro, but under no circumstances do we support the concept of ethnically clean states. Kosovo must be independent come what may and Montenegro must be independent come what may, just to ensure that Serbia is weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is still – and I admit it – for there to be a new Yugoslavia, a Yugoslavia with an independent state of Kosovo and an independent state of Montenegro; it is not for there to be new divisions, renewed conflict, renewed clashes or renewed force, that is not our objective; on the contrary, a new Yugoslavia needs to emerge, a democratic Yugoslavia, where people stay willingly, not under duress, not under brutality, but because they are convinced that a federation can emerge which has a democratic future, a democratic future under different leaders and from which Milosevic can be removed – if possible – by bringing him before the court in the Hague, because we want justice, but we want justice with peace.</p>

Despite this, I would like to make an attempt at explaining why I am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment. There is of course the support of hundreds of thousands of people – the figure of one million has even been mooted – who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help Mr Kostunica against the wishes of Mr Milosevic. There are also the latest reports on the role of the police, which, as has been apparent for some time, have been in doubt as to whether to continue to support the regime, and which, as it appears from the first reports now coming in, have opted to side with the demonstrators; according to the latest reports, the same could happen with the army. There is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation has resigned, this being a signal, I believe, that he refuses to act as the extension and mouthpiece of the Milosevic regime any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two minor observations with regard to the future. I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by Doris Pack to reach the decision quickly, in fact as quickly as possible, to lift the sanctions, because these have done far more harm than good. I would also like to say – and this is more of an appeal to the Council, but I am sharing it with the Commission and Parliament for now – let us not just make fine declarations with regard to the aid which we will soon be willing to grant to Serbia, but let us also make room for this cause in our own budget, the European Union’s budget, so that we do not end up concluding that we can only help Serbia by taking funding away from other projects in the Balkans which need our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity, and once a new Yugoslavian government has been installed, so that we, in tandem with this new government, can make plans for the reconstruction of a new Serbia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst – and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago.

It is of course difficult to determine how long the Serbian population will need to continue fighting before Milosevic will actually disappear off the scene. A unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population has proved extremely important, as it will continue to do so for the next couple of days and weeks. This means, at the same time, that the European Union too will very much need to form a united front. In this context, I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, fortunately abandoned by almost all parties in the Lower Chamber, adopted a stance out of the blue which goes against the unity of the European Union and against the wishes of the opposition in Serbia. I believe this displays a lack of earnestness, and is at the same time insulting to his office. It also signals an excessive drive to stand out from the rest, to the point where the life of people could be at stake. I believe it is also important to establish at this time on what basis the High Representative and the Council will need to adopt their positions. Will it be by largest common denominator, or on the basis of a large majority in the Council, which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to establishing unity in the Union, this is also, of course, about recognising the fact that Kostunica has won the presidential elections. I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally it is difficult to mention budgets at this early stage. The High Representative explained this only a moment ago, but what we can do is to selectively lift sanctions by way of sending a message to the Serbian electorate. The neighbouring countries will take a great interest in this too. I hope that the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, will take clear measures in this respect in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to gauge Serbia’s future. As we have already witnessed all over Central Europe, constitutional states and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution. Nationalism does not automatically disappear if a democratically elected president can be found. We should therefore remain level-headed and focused in our attempts to create openings for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe, also from a moral-political point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
