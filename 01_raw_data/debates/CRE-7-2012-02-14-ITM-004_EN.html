<p class="contents">There is no clear or definitive indication of what is meant by ‘scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity’. The Directive ought not, in fact, to prevent Member States from limiting the number of authorisations for reasons other than scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as in the case of itinerant traders, they do not have exclusive use of the area subject to concession because at the end of working hours, this becomes available to all, and is sometimes reassigned to other activities. Moreover, in Italy, local authorities may already increase the number both of concessions and areas reserved for markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, therefore, there ought not to be an automatic correlation between the concept of public space and the criterion of scarce natural resources, since parking may take place in one part of the area only and for a limited number of hours per day.</p>

<p class="contents">Some social services have been excluded from the directive, but not all. Moreover, I should like to remind you that an amendment on the exclusion of all such services was rejected by Parliament. I do not believe that my services have informed me of any issues regarding the application of the directive to social services.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific nature of some services, such as those which you mentioned, is recognised and taken into account by safeguards set out in the directive. The directive does not address the issue of the funding of these services. The conditions set by Member States to ensure that these services indeed fulfil their social function are not covered by its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, Ms Angelilli, the directive does not prevent Member States from conserving their authorisation systems which are substantiated by social policy objectives, for example for the opening of crèches. These objectives may relate to the protection of minors or vulnerable people.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that it is logical that the directive’s implementation should not create problems for social services, such as those, if I understood correctly, that you highlighted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to admit there is a little delay with this package, but this is also about quality and we believe that it is very important to get it right after such a long period of conflict and consultation. We invested a lot in this consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last June, at a conference we organised in Brussels, I outlined the structure of the legal instruments the Commission would like to use to address the question of posting. This consists of two elements: an enforcement directive in order to ensure that the implementation of the original directive improves in terms of its quality, and a Monti II regulation on social rights, following the pattern of the previous Monti I Regulation in the context of cross-border trade, only this time in the context of cross-border services.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the latter is to ensure that fundamental social rights are not subordinated to economic freedoms and vice-versa, and that there are further clarifications about the powers of various courts if industrial action takes place. But I think it is very important to stress that by reopening the original directive we would not go very far; in fact we would undermine the key objective of the original legal instrument which is to facilitate cross-border services and at the same time fight social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The enforcement directive will facilitate further cross-border service provision for companies through better administrative cooperation, more transparent information and limits to national control measures. It will prevent abuses by clarifying the elements of the notion of posting, limit the opportunities to impose national control measures by codifying the case law of the Court, and contribute to fairer competition and a more level playing field, for example, for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is better administrative cooperation. We have had many consultations with stakeholders and the various participants in this debate with a view to taking every possible aspect into account. There is still fine tuning to do, and the proposed date for adoption is March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What I have said many times, including a few months ago, on my visit to Athens, is that the Greek people are not alone. Through exceptional measures, the entire EU and the International Monetary Fund have provided support to Greece in this comprehensive plan towards its recovery, and I am not just referring to public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware, Mr Papanikolaou, that the effort which is being asked of Greek people is extremely stringent and demanding. However, I believe that the fundamental Greek economic indicators show that, if this plan is followed and respected by all of the partners and by the Greeks themselves, the Greek people can come through this.</p>
<p class="contents">Since what we are discussing here today, Mr Papanikolaou, is the Services Directive and the service economy, I should like to underline that beyond the activities covered by the directive itself, which make up 40% of the EU’s economy, services, as we are well aware, account for an even greater part of GDP, in the EU’s economy. This is particularly the case in your country, which is one of the most open and best positioned in this respect, especially as regards the tourist industry economy, which is an area that Commissioner Tajani is monitoring relentlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, as I also said in another debate yesterday, that Greece, despite the great difficulties it is facing, can bounce back, particularly by being one of the countries to integrate itself the most and the most quickly. This integration is needed – and a number of sectors are concerned, including many services, especially connected to the tourism economy – because Greece is one of the countries which has the most to benefit from an integrated single market and the facilitation of trade, electronic commerce, mobility and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, along with my colleagues, I am going to take great care, as is my role as the person in charge of this Directive on Services, to support the Greek authorities in implementing all aspects and the full potential of this Directive on Services, on a practical level.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I am able to say since the matter we are discussing today is the service economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I, personally, deeply feel that it is not right, for EU citizens at the moment, for us to only be talking about austerity, regulation, surveillance and governance. All of these words are restrictive, even if they are the words and actions which are needed. We must also talk about growth and give citizens a clearer outlook in terms of employment and development. This is true for Greece and it is also true for the whole of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I find it extremely positive that at the last European Council meeting, held about ten days ago, the majority of the agenda was devoted to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done in the short term to restart the economic machine in the countries where this is needed? What can be done in the medium or long term? For example, with the Single Market Act, of which the Services Directive is one of the components, we have a dozen or so measures on our agenda for facilitating mobility, employment, export, innovation and trade and to kick-start growth in the medium or long term. Other initiatives, such as the project bonds, may be taken as a shorter-term solution to achieving growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as regards Greece, I think that under the plan which amounts to EUR 130 billion, it is not just a case of getting public finances back on track and safeguarding the banking sector, it is also a case of taking rapid action, in particular via Structural Funds, to get employment and growth going again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context, Mr Papanikolaou, that the service economy, which is so important for your country and which is one of the most open and most powerful in Europe in terms of tourism, has a special role to play. I will devote my full attention to this to ensure that this Services Directive is actually and effectively implemented in Greece’s case and for Greece’s benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that of public services and the implementation of this quality framework which Mr Almunia and I have on the whole proposed in two cross-cutting texts. One of these texts deals with State aid and, as you pointed out, and as the relevant associations and non-governmental organisations have made clear to us, the exercise of social services continues to be covered. The second cross-cutting text – which is a major aspect of this quality framework – deals with the overhaul of measures relating to public services and concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Social entrepreneurship which, according to my figures, honourable Members accounts for between 15% and 17% of GDP and employment, is an additional issue and is, in my mind, just as important as the main area of work on the social economy. In many cases, we are not talking about public services, but profitable enterprises which practice social inclusion among their employees, by employing disabled persons or other people in difficulty, or enterprises whose activities themselves have a vocation focused on solidarity, inclusion or social solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, a few weeks ago, in November, for the first time, we in the Commission held a conference with Professor Yunus, which was attended by 1 200 people and which aimed to help us work on three topics. The first was the financing of such enterprises, and in this regard the Commission presented an initial proposal on the Social Investment Fund, which is a new instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The second was regulatory and normative or statutory supervision, which is the point you mentioned. A few days ago, Ms Vergnaud, as promised, we submitted the European Foundation Statute, which is now under discussion by the Council and by Parliament. Mr Tajani is working on statutes for cooperatives and mutuals which are extremely important forms of organisation, and for which it is important to establish what further improvements can be made at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area of work on social entrepreneurship involves improving the visibility of these activities through indicators, labels, and so on, and I myself am pursuing this area. I am, in any case, personally engaged, alongside Mr Andor, Mr Tajani and others, in ensuring that from now on Commission initiatives support this extremely important sector, which has undoubtedly been neglected or forgotten and which certainly comes under the competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief, honourable Members, that there cannot be sustainable economic performance without a number of conditions: an effectively functioning single market, a major effort in research and innovation, and social cohesion. When we refer to social cohesion, we are referring, Ms Vergnaud, to the two topics that you mentioned: public services, of course, that is to say basic services, in particular social services, but also the social enterprise sector, which I have just mentioned and which we endorse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As part of the effort to improve the legal environment, we have initiated a review aimed at analysing the current situation of mutuals in Europe. The findings will form the basis for reflection on a new political initiative, including the possible drafting of a European statute for mutuals. This work will complement the review which the European Parliament began at the beginning of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also going to publish a report addressed at European institutions on the application of the regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society. This report will be discussed at two conferences to be held this year, which the United Nations has declared as the International Year of Cooperatives. The first conference will be held in April, and attended by professional associations, and the second in September during Cyprus’ Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to cooperatives, their social impact is, is my view, very significant. We are going to continue to support them together with cooperative banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to cite an example: I organised a trip to Brazil on the topic of the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and took representatives from cooperatives along with me to try to promote networks for the internationalisation of cooperatives. This is, for me, a very important sector and I share what was said by Commissioner Barnier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implementing the Services Directive was an important step towards the completion of the single market. Given that services represent about 70% of the European economy, their potential for boosting economic growth and creating new jobs is substantial. We have to admit, however, that Member States have had difficulties with the transposition of the Directive and that, despite the three-year implementation period, there have been considerable delays. Besides the transposition of European legislation into national legislations, a series of additional measures were necessary in order to implement the provisions of the Directive. Nonetheless, more than two years have elapsed now, which is a long enough period to allow the results to be measured. Is the Commission able to offer any concrete data, analyses and estimates on what impact the implementation of the Services Directive has had on the European economy so far, and more specifically, on small and medium-sized enterprises?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to inform you and your colleagues, Ms Hyusmenova, that I make it my own personal duty to go to each Member State to see how things are going. A few days ago, on Thursday, I was in Madrid where I delivered the last of the 27 workshops which – as promised before Parliament – I have held in all of the EU’s capitals with all of the national civil servants who are, in particular, responsible for the Services Directive, but who are also responsible for the directives on professional qualifications and public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I can tell you that, following this period of work with all of the civil servants who are responsible for these texts, all of the Member States, apart from Greece, have now taken full transposition measures. Germany and Austria, whose federal system you are familiar with, have had some rather specific issues, due in fact to this federal system, as the texts had to be transposed at regional level. This has recently been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the two complaints that I lodged before the European Court of Justice can now be withdrawn, since Germany and Austria have fulfilled their obligations. The court referral for Greece is still relevant as regards the quality of the transposition measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I promised, and this is something that you requested specifically in adopting the Services Directive, to present a report on the application of the directive’s key measures. In addition to what was already presented last Monday on the mutual assessment process involving Member States and undertaken by the Commission, we will present a report, in the second quarter of 2012, on the application of all of the directive’s key measures, especially on the important issue of cross-border services.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also drawing the first conclusions, in our role as guardian of the Treaties, on the weaknesses or shortcomings that exist with regard to the practical and effective implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, honourable Members, 2012 should be the year of the full application of the Services Directive as it stands with all of its measures and all of its potential. Aside from what I have been able to say today on the matter and the work which I am doing in each Member State, this issue is the subject of the full and detailed assessment and information report which we will present to you by the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a proposed date for college debate and adoption which will be in March 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various reasons for the delay, not least because we had to accelerate some other initiatives like the Youth Opportunities, which I am sure you also consider very important. The Youth Opportunities were not originally on the agenda, but we had to respond to the urgency of youth unemployment, which is why we scheduled that for last December. There is also very serious work under way: serious coordination between our services on the question of the posting of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you also suggested, this is a very complex matter, and I am very grateful for the contribution of many Members of the European Parliament to this discussion. You brought to my attention very difficult cases, not only those where the European Court of Justice made decisions which many of you saw as controversial, but also the more recent Flamanville case. Our intention is to eliminate the likelihood of a recurrence of such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We want posted workers to work in a safe, well-regulated environment with greater awareness of the circumstances and their own rights, and much better administrative cooperation between the Member States. This is covered in the documents we have been drawing up since last summer when we had the stakeholder conference last June. The structure, as I have already explained to Ms Steinruck, is an enforcement directive, in order to contribute to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">As you probably know, this falls under the scope of the Single Market Act, as it concerns the single labour market, and also constitutes regulation to follow up on fundamental social rights with a view to having better guarantees in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I and members of my committee are deeply engaged in following through the transposition. I want to thank the Commissioner for his energy in pursuing this.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, however, is not so much related to the actual legal requirement on Member States to transpose the directive. My observation, based on visits to a number of countries and on talking both to governments and to business organisations, is that we have absolutely encouraged Member States to make a substantial investment in providing services – the points of single contact – with a view to opening up their markets to service providers from other countries, and also to support and train all their public authorities in accepting applications from other countries for the provision of services. But my experience is that most businesses who can potentially take advantage of this know nothing about it at all, because the one thing Member States have neglected is any promotion of these great new opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commissioner’s reassurance, with regard to the benchmarking exercise, that we will actually have some real information on the ground about businesses’ awareness of the opportunities that have been created. Otherwise it is simply like saying to Member States that they should invest heavily in this great new product and new idea, but that they should not tell anyone about it. How is that a sensible strategy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I have noticed, Mr Harbour, from my work at local level with these workshops I have just completed, is that we must connect the two wheels, not so that they turn together, but so that they work in connection with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">They work in connection with one another when texts are properly transposed. This is basically the case when texts are implemented effectively. This is not yet the case in all Member States. It is especially the case when those for whom we in Parliament, the Council and the Commission are working together to create these texts, that is to say businesses and particularly small and medium-sized businesses, or citizens, are aware of what we do for them, and this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, honourable Members, I attach so much importance to these local instruments. Almost two years ago, when you kindly agreed to the Commission’s investiture and questioned me at the hearing, I stated before you that during these five years our ambition, and this is very significant, would be to reconcile small and medium-sized enterprises and EU consumers with the single market. There is a sentiment that this single market was not created for them, and that it is for the big and powerful rather than small enterprises and consumers. We must change that. The Services Directive is one of the instruments which can help us to achieve this, along with a number of structures, the existence of which I am in the process of checking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internal Market Information System (IMI), which will be discussed again and which can also be employed for professional qualifications, allows direct interactive dialogue between local authorities via the Internet. Six thousand administrative bodies are now actively using this system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the Solvit system, which is now functioning properly in almost all Member States, to prevent discouragement and legal action, and to facilitate mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, as Mr Harbour pointed out, the Points of Single Contact which are of great importance and which today exist in all Member States. I think I am safe in saying that there is only one country, Romania, in which the Points of Single Contact are not yet in operation. The Points of Single Contact are, in my opinion, an extremely important tool, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Naturally, these points of contact must be equipped with essential features such as online and cross-border procedures. This is still far from the case. These Points of Single Contact are in place, but are not yet able to provide the full potential of which businesses are in need.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why in 2012, which as I said earlier will be the year of the Services Directive’s full implementation, I will, Mr Harbour, focus efforts particularly on the proper functioning of these Points of Single Contact with modern, digital means and proper information in their regard.</p>
<p class="contents">That is another reason why, on Parliament’s initiative, we are going to organise the week for renewed growth together, from 15-22 October, at the same time as the European Week of Small and Medium Enterprises which is being organised by Mr Tajani. Together with the European Parliament, the national parliaments, chambers of commerce, trade unions and any organisations who wish to be involved, we are going to organise a European week on the Single Market Act and on all of the tools that I just mentioned. This will be a full week of people-oriented, rather than technocratic or bureaucratic, information on the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I want us to put a face to the single market, and to men and women who have succeeded and failed through it, and see how we can deal with these failures. That, Mr Harbour, will be the aim of the week which we are going to hold together in October of this year, and during which the focus will be on Points of Single Contact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I go round talking to businesses, I have to tell them about the EUGO Portal. I have to give them the excellent brochure that the Commission has produced because, actually, my own Government is not doing very much, and I have said so to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we going to reach governments and their small-enterprise divisions – and Mr Tajani is absolutely involved in this as our lead on SMEs – to tell them about these sources of information and how they can deploy them? The problem is that we have done all this great stuff but the people who are really going to energise the economy by investing and trading across borders, it seems to me, will not be sufficiently excited and energised to take advantage of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He could also express his view on this subject. I think that there is a need to diffuse information.</p>
<p class="contents">We have devised this Single Market Week to promote renewed growth, as well as the European SME Week in October; I am also checking that the Points of Single Contact are in operation. We cannot do everything from here in Brussels. We need the involvement of Member States. We also need the cooperation of the chambers of commerce, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the brochure which we have produced. We will probably produce others, and I will, either via the Internet or in person, request support from the chambers of commerce, for example, which have direct links with small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they can diffuse this information to their members and to the people on the ground responsible for creating employment and growth. This is something which cannot easily be done from Brussels and for which we need intermediaries and partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like us to have the opportunity, in 2012 and before October’s Single Market Week, to make sure that every business in the EU receives this basic information on the Services Directive and on the other actions we are taking, for example with regard to accounting standards or public procurement, which are aimed at encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises’ involvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look at all the European Commission’s initiatives – for which it has our heartiest compliments – we are creating a thousand jobs in Europe, or at any rate are able to create a thousand jobs in Europe. Yet we are not getting through to businesses. There is no shortage of worthwhile initiatives in the Member States, and SMEs can create jobs, but somehow or other, despite the Commission’s enthusiasm, the businesses are not getting the message.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions in this regard. The Commission has been operating now for almost two and a half years: might not we in the internal market zone receive an interim report on how the SMA (Single Market Act) is working in practice? Secondly, should we not link the internal market more to the European Semester? The European Semester is going well in the Member States and also fitting in well with the national reform programme. Member States are on the ball. Shouldn’t we be connecting up more? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By means of this network, we have a presence in 51 countries, with around 600 contact points and over 3 000 professionals to its credit. I would say that Enterprise Europe Network is the most important European, if not global, network helping small and medium-sized enterprises. We have a presence in all 27 Member States and in eight third countries taking part in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. I am referring to Croatia, Israel and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are some additional figures on the advice and information provided, including that related to the internal market. Around 300 000 businesses have made direct use of this kind of service, while 600 000 others have taken part in events organised with the same objective; 225 000 have used the special advice service on subjects such as access to finance, intellectual property, business development at the European and international level, and innovation through the adoption of new work methods and new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, the network facilitates the conclusion of around 2 500 formal cross-border deals between businesses, giving them benefits in terms of maintaining turnover, employment and investment levels. We have also received 10 000 comments to date from businesses giving us their opinions on policy, legislative initiatives and European-level programmes.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I am able talk about a point that concerns many small businesses and the illegal activities to which they fall victim, such as counterfeiting, for example. Yesterday, we spoke about the creation of the European Observatory on intellectual property infringement, which you supported. This subject is linked to the one you have brought up.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress in this area, since we are in the process right now of creating this observatory, via the Trademarks Office in Alicante, and giving it more powers. The observatory will look into problems such as piracy, of course, and the problem of counterfeiting in particular, in order to give us a clearer picture of the situation so that we can take the appropriate measures. These will not always, I may add, be enforcement measures: they will often involve explanation and training, in order to combat the counterfeiting to which very many small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe fall victim. It has been calculated that counterfeiting has caused the loss of 200 000 jobs across Europe.</p>

At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty.

<p class="contents">My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion.

I should also add that, going beyond social services of general interest, you and I share the same concern, since we are aiming at the same political goal for the sake of this competitive social market economy. This goal, which must be, or must become once again, the basis for European action, is to guarantee the quality, accessibility and sustainability of public services in Europe, and wherever necessary to adapt the existing legislation to the realities of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a major commitment, which we are keeping through the Commission’s cross-cutting action on public services, to forge closer links between economic realities and freedom on the one hand and social realities on the other. I am thinking about fundamental social rights within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We may argue and debate the issues among ourselves, but I think President Barroso has always been keen to talk about a quality framework. The forthcoming cross-cutting document to be presented by Commissioner Andor on the posting of workers ties in with this subject, as does the document presented by our colleague Mr Almunia on state aid, to which I also contributed. In particular, Ms Gebhardt, the ‘Almunia-Barnier package’ includes a document that clarifies the situation, and provides, for example, for a complete exemption from the state-aid notification procedure for public funding for healthcare services and essential social services, where these fall within the scope of EU law. This package is the second in this quality framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The third package is the one I presented on the directives on public procurement and concession contracts, which I have ensured will play a very specific role in the whole area of invitations to tender and public procurement of social services, with higher thresholds and simplified procedural rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think that an overall legislative framework is needed over and above the above-mentioned or future cross-cutting directives, and the vertical, or sectoral directives which, if one looks at the list, cover practically all services. Take, for example the Postal Directives, for which I am responsible. I am overseeing the implementation of the directive very closely, from now on in conjunction with users.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these cross-cutting directives, with the improvements I have just spoken of and further consolidation by Parliament, together with the sectoral directives, make up the quality framework that President Barroso has undertaken before this House to establish or consolidate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this moment in time, thinking in practical terms about people’s anxiety and concerns, especially those about social services and healthcare, we feel that all the concrete, practical protection that citizens need is provided by the directives and cross-cutting texts I have mentioned, as well as the sectoral directives. The latter are also at issue and must be implemented or improved where necessary, but above all be properly drafted.

This must be the subject of vigorous measures. I am personally drawing up a series of points to present to the College of Commissioners on the theme of growth, one of which will precisely be access to credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the details of your question, we have already received replies from the Member States. A meeting took place in Brussels on 3 February this year with representatives from the 27 Member States. During this meeting, we received some comforting replies, others less so.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Austria decided to transpose the Directive before summer 2012; Belgium before the end of 2012; Bulgaria by the end of summer 2012; Cyprus in summer 2012; and the Czech Republic in March 2013, which is the final deadline. The same can be said for Denmark. Estonia will adopt the Directive in March 2013; Finland for the end of 2012; France has assured us that it will proceed to transposition by March 2013; Germany by the first four months of 2012 (adoption by its Parliament); Greece will wait for March 2013, as will Hungary and Ireland; Italy will do so on 14 November 2012; Latvia in September 2012; Lithuania in autumn 2012; Luxembourg by the end of 2012; Malta has not yet set a date but will certainly comply with the deadline; the Netherlands will do so by summer 2012; Poland by the end of 2012; Portugal will do so at the end of March 2013; Romania in March 2013; Slovakia by the end of 2012; Slovenia did not attend the meeting; the Spanish Parliament will examine the text of the legislation in autumn 2012, following which, adoption will take place in March 2013; Sweden will adopt it by the end of 2012, whereas the United Kingdom has confirmed that the Directive will be transposed in March 2013. This is all the information I have concerning the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall continue to ensure that the deadlines are respected, since I believe that an acceleration of the timetable is fundamental for small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in times of crisis, so that they can be paid not only by the public sector but also by larger suppliers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current directive and subsequent legal rulings have undermined that principle, which has jeopardised workers’ fundamental rights and even essential rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to your replies to Ms Turunen and Ms Steinruck and I congratulate you because, finally, after managing to overcome the problems, we will have a directive and a regulation in March. However, what matters now, Mr Andor, is that these should not be just any directive or regulation but an outstanding directive and regulation that resolve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Andor, I am asking you now whether this directive and regulation are finally going to reflect reality: that workers should always be covered by the labour law and social law of the host country and never those of their country of origin, and first and foremost, that they should not be disadvantaged by companies’ freedom of establishment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important that regulations in the host countries include a core group of provisions on the posting of workers that apply to workers posted from another country who remain employees of a company that operates in a different Member State. This also has to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an easy question, but we have to be attentive to two sides of the issue: posted workers are employees from Member State A, but they act and work in Member State B.

<p class="contents">In particular, the most prominent issue concerns the application of derogations to the authorisation system, which are provided for where the system is not discriminatory or is justified on public interest grounds and meets the proportionality criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s rigid application – or, rather, interpretation – of the derogation provisions stands in contrast to measures on safeguarding trust and on legal certainty. Furthermore, in combination with the measures on licensing and public procurement – even in the latest version proposed by the Commission, which excludes the licensing of activities in public areas from its provisions – it reveals a regulatory vacuum at EU level, which has thrown major sectors into chaos, as has happened with beach establishment operators in Italy, tulip growers in the Netherlands and Christmas market traders in Germany, to mention just a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not think that intervention is needed to properly regulate free competition, to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises and to preserve the character of certain sectors that are important to many Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for your own country, when I visited the Italian Parliament where I met various committees, many Italian MPs and senators brought up the subject of beach-concession holders, which is a sensitive issue in Italy. I could quote other cases also.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not think up this directive. I am not going to say that we shall add or remove this or that occupation. It covers some occupations, and does not cover others. In fact, there are very few now – security services and online gambling – that are not covered by European legislation. This is so for the time being, at any rate, since, as regards online gambling, we shall be bringing in legislation and taking steps with the action plan. Everything else is covered in one way or another, either by a cross-cutting directive or a sectoral directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I am obliged to oversee the proper implementation of the directive, whilst maintaining the principle of proportionality, as you mentioned yourself. My staff and I are prepared to go through the cases that pose the most problems with a fine-toothed comb. I said so in the case of beach-concession holders, and I can say it for other occupations also. Nonetheless, the occupations that are covered by this directive must abide by it and must develop within the framework of the directive’s provisions. I am able to say this much. I can confirm to you that I am willing to work on individual cases, with a pragmatic, non-ideological approach. However, my job is to implement the directive as intelligently and speedily as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At any rate, I do not think Italy’s new Prime Minister has this in mind. I know him well; he was a member of the European Commission himself for ten years, and therefore a guardian of the Treaties, as we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">The work that is currently in the pipeline, in which I am involved, is practical, pragmatic, thorough work to ensure that this Directive, which covers beach concessions, can be applied to this sector whilst taking account, in an intelligent way, of the needs of the tourism sector, of which I am well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Morganti, in a previous role, I was responsible for a region that is one of France’s biggest tourist areas, and I am aware of the importance of the tourism market. However, at the same time, there is no reason why the Services Directive should not be applied to those involved in this field of market competition, whilst taking into consideration the specific features of particular occupations.</p>
