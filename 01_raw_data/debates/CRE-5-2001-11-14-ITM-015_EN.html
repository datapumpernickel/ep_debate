<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the European Parliament is offering the Commission the opportunity to correct the proposed regulation it delivered to Parliament and the Council. The intention of the report, approved by the Committee on Fisheries that we are discussing at the moment, is to correct the rigidity of this proposal, which is currently preventing progress being made in finding solutions to problems for the people affected by the non-renewal of the EC-Morocco fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">From the time the agreement expired, on 30 November 1999, until the time it became clear that a new agreement would not be reached, owners of more than 400 vessels and some 4 300 fishermen were both hopeful and fearful at the time when negotiations between the Community and Morocco were being prolonged.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not until 26 March 2001 that Commissioner Fischler announced that it had been impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. From that moment, the Community set itself the objective of converting the affected fishing fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">By presenting this proposed regulation, the Commission is conforming to the guidelines set by the Nice European Council of 7 December 2000. At that Summit, the European Council ordered the Commission to propose a specific action plan for the restructuring of this Community fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I must state clearly that this proposed regulation does not conform to the needs of the sector in question. Once again the Commission seems to be presenting proposals, the objective of which we do not understand, that do not amount to decisive action in support of a fleet and certain regions which are suffering a serious crisis. In fact, rather than helping to preserve most of the fleet and its economic activity, the Commission is presenting a rigid proposal which, if the Council approves it without the substantial amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, will have the effect of breaking up a fleet for which the ship owners and local authorities of those regions feel capable of finding alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal must therefore be amended in the way approved by the Committee on Fisheries, so that the actions proposed may have a beneficial effect on the sector in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries does not share the Commission’s breaking-up approach. The Commission could have focussed on the existing opportunities in alternative sectors, such as the processing industry, aquiculture and especially the promotion of fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the proposal excludes sectors directly affected by the non-renewal of the agreement, such as the non-extractive fisheries industries. The land-based companies, during the long negotiation process, have suffered a series of economic setbacks that have led to employment rationalisations and redundancies, leading to considerable losses. Today they are faced with a future just as uncertain as that of the fleet they depend on.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this breaking-up approach, the sector affected and the regional authorities have reached verbal agreements with companies and ship owners from various Maghreb countries to create mixed companies, and in this way, according to the estimates of the sector, in the small-scale sector, around a hundred vessels could be relocated with the help of this specific measure, if it were more flexible, thereby reducing to 26 those vessels destined for scrapping. This would maintain an economic activity which is vital to certain regions and ensure that those who want to continue being ship owners and fishermen are able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments contained in the Committee on Fisheries’ report, in summary, modify the proposed regulation in the following fashion:</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to ship owners and fishermen, the land-based fisheries industry which was directly linked to the existence of this agreement are included, provided that their losses exceed 70%.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement that the people affected must have been subsidised for a period of at least nine consecutive months as a result of inactivity in order to benefit now from this specific measure is removed. This requirement leads to the exclusion of those people who, sometimes temporarily, found alternative work while waiting for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco to be reached. This is all the more serious if we bear in mind that these ship owners and fishermen had not been warned that, if they found an activity, they would be penalised when it came to conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the requirement to return aid granted for modernisation. It is not right to apply penalties of a backdated nature in the case of aid which was not subject to these conditions at the time of being granted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal intends to increase public aid per ship owner by 20% in the case of scrapping or transfer to a third country. The Committee on Fisheries believes that fishermen must also benefit from this increase of 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also redistributed the sum allocated to this specific measure in such a way that the amount intended for scrapping is 30%, for the creation of mixed companies, 35%, and for socio-economic measures, also 35%. This would lead to better implementation of the specific measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I will mention the budgetary aspect. In accordance with the conclusions of the Nice European Council, the Commission proposes granting up to EUR 197 million for this specific measure. It proposes implementing the flexibility instrument in 2002 and allocating the appropriations corresponding to heading 2 of the financial perspectives. The saving resulting from the non-renewal of the agreement has been EUR 500 million. It is natural that the Community should also contribute to the cost of converting this fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, on voting on the report we are debating today, our institution will write the last page of a story that has been told since August 1987, when the European Union signed its first fisheries agreement with that country, but which for Spain goes back almost twenty-five years.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore Community fishermen and ship owners whose lives have been exclusively linked with the existence of the Moroccan fishing grounds. Our obligation today is to close this chapter with the greatest possible dignity and responsibility towards this sector, which is going to suffer an unprecedented fisheries conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must thank the Commission for their efforts over the last two long years to try to make tomorrow’s vote unnecessary. But, given that the situation is irreversible, we must also recognise the solidarity contained in the Commission’s proposal, its recognition that the end of an era cannot be marked by the spectacle of us being miserly towards those people who are waiting anxiously for this plan in order to carry on living and working, the financial cost of which is fully justified. We hope that the other institutions have sufficient dignity to accept this need.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries, above all, contribute to adding a greater degree of flexibility in order to allow Community solidarity to truly benefit a very heterogeneous fleet, which over the last two years has not ceased to seek its own solutions; solutions which greater legislative rigidity may contribute to blocking.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, our main obligation is to approve this report in order to provide the necessary legal basis so that on second reading of the budget the necessary appropriations can be provided to finance the restructuring plan. This restructuring plan will no doubt put an end to part of an historic fleet, but it must not mean the end of fisheries relations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to imagine that Morocco really wants to turn its back on the European Union, amongst other things because we share two seas and we are obliged to be neighbours, and Morocco can only benefit from this proximity. I therefore ask the Commission to remain receptive and promote any mutually beneficial fishing cooperation initiative which may arise in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for the wonderful work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lage (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council regulation on the promotion of the conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, which is the subject of the excellent report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, deserves our unreserved approval.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal shows that the European Union cares about the fate of such vulnerable and fragile activities, whose survival depended on the renewal or non-renewal of a fishing agreement with Morocco. European solidarity works and continues to work. That is for the sceptics. The Commission proposal considers the problems of conversion from its economic and social angles. It also has the merit of mobilising new money, EUR 197 million, which is compatible with the mobilisation of other resources already allocated under the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal there are 570 fishermen who receive support under this programme, 400 of whom live in Sesimbra, a small, attractive fishing and tourist town very close to Lisbon. Of these 400 who live in Sesimbra, 150 are already over 55 years old, which means they can be moved into early retirement, since at this age it is difficult to retrain them for a different job. In simple terms, while the shipowners are liable to receive supplements of 20%, the same is not true for the fishermen, which to me seems an injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the fishermen will be able to get EUR 10 000 euros over one year if they do not do any other work. The possibility of a 20% increase, although modest, would allow them to raise that sum to EUR 12 000, which would make it rather more attractive. Furthermore, the proposal has quite a rigid structure and should be made more flexible, allowing the Member States, in this case Portugal and Spain, to adapt better to situations that are truly complex and sometimes do not fit within the rigid stays of the regulation. This flexibility should be accepted so that the aid already granted by the end of 2001 should not all be accounted for under the part of FIFG Article 4 intended for socio-economic measures, and all of it within the Lisbon and Tagus valley region, and it would be better if it could be diluted in other programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I entirely agree with the content and proposals of the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, which I think are lucid and sensible, particularly those dealing with the possibility of supporting processing activities that were dependent on fishing. Indeed, it does not make sense that certain fishery-dependent processing and marketing activities, which in this case have been hit very hard, should not also be funded. For this reason, too, we are grateful for the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turning to Morocco, the Greens will be voting against this proposal, not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work, but because we oppose this particular package.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people, those involved in Morocco. This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners. Secondly, it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries, including flags of convenience, and there are still no controls in place to prevent this. Thirdly, it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise, we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers' money. Clearly, the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed. Morocco is the first, but there are more to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its quality is all the more notable insofar as it deals with an issue which is hugely traumatic for a large number of people who depend on fishing in Portugal and in Galicia, Andalucia and the Canary Islands in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of finding the best possible way to alleviate the effects of what I believe to be, if you pardon the expression, the chronicle of a death foretold. For a long time my group has been warning the House of the risks of not linking the fisheries agreement with Morocco to the association agreement. Today all I can say is that the Kingdom of Morocco has not shown the willingness to negotiate that we expect from a trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to acknowledge the Commission’s efforts to lessen the impact of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but I am not going to repeat what has already been said. It is sufficient to refer to the interventions of the rapporteur and Mrs Fraga, for example, to realise that the Committee on Fisheries has considerably improved on the Commission’s proposal, by making it fairer.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it only remains for me to ask, as my group will do, the House to approve the report of the Committee on Fisheries, written by Mrs Miguélez, tomorrow, and that, once approved by Parliament, the report may quickly be provided with the appropriate financial instruments so that it can be implemented. And, in this respect, I would like to make it clear that the budgetary flexibility instrument is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it would be horrendous, to give an example, if an Objective 1 region, with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, which also suffers the consequences of the competition created by the very favourable agreements which we, Europeans, have granted to Morocco in the fruit products sector, not only suffered the effects of a tough conversion as a result of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but that, furthermore, as a result of the budgetary miserliness of certain people, it also ended up without Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, for the good work she has done despite the urgency of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the work they have done. I believe that together we have all been able to meet the demands of the circumstances: the rapporteur, the authors of the amendments, those who have made it possible to reach compromises and the Members who have supported us. I thank them all for their understanding and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency procedure, as I said, always obliges us to work more quickly than we would have liked, but, even so, the result has been very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I now hope the Commission takes account of the significant improvements which the Committee on Fisheries has introduced into its proposal. I will highlight the extension of aid, better coverage and, above all, the flexibility introduced into the application of the various measures under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must speak about the funding of this plan, although this is not strictly an issue for our committee. In Nice, the Council made a political commitment at the highest level, at the level of Heads of State and Government, to the people affected by the dramatic situation created following the failure of the negotiations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Commission has also been able to meet the demands of the circumstances, and I would like to acknowledge that here: the use of the flexibility instrument and the EUR 197 million it proposes for funding demonstrate this. I therefore congratulate them.</p>
<p class="contents">I now ask Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and the Council to support the European Commission and the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and reach the necessary compromise so that this essential EUR 197 million can be used for the proposed purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a political commitment and a favourable opinion from this Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and we strongly urge that they be complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that compensation for the stoppage finishes at the end of this year. The central question, then, is the allocation of EUR 197 million for the restructuring programme that is to commence in January 2002, which should be improved along the lines proposed in the Miguélez Ramos report. For our part, we consider the proposal the Commission has made of using a flexibility instrument in the budget to be acceptable, and we regret that the matter was not made clearer during the first reading of the budget by the European Parliament, inserting the amounts on the line and requesting the use of the flexibility instrument, as in fact the Committee on Fisheries had proposed, as our chairman has just reminded us. It is, therefore, important that the next Budgetary Council should stop blocking and take these proposals into account, creating the solution that will allow the fleet restructuring programme to come into force early next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The alarm bells are ringing, the Gordian knot has not yet been hacked in two, but Parliament, I hope, is not giving up. What is at stake here? At stake are jobs and the way the people of Europe perceive the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the emergency motion tabled by our colleague, Daniel Varela, we have an opportunity this evening to discuss an issue which is as problematic as it is urgent. It concerns how to deal openly and honestly with the consequences which the failure of the negotiations with Morocco have had for the Iberian peninsular.</p>
<p class="contents">The bare facts are quickly stated: since November 1990, we have heard, the EU fleet – in practice deep-sea fishermen from Spain and Portugal – has no longer been able to fall back on the resources off the coast of Morocco. The 4 300 fishermen and 400 vessels affected are hoping that the compensation payments will be continued when they expire in December 2001, as Mrs Miguélez Ramos has explained to us so convincingly. Behind these figures there are people, families and whole communities who are committed to a traditional industry and we now need to give that industry prospects for the future. In so doing, our efforts should certainly not be confined solely to giving financial handouts. It is much more important that we – and here I would bring the Commission and the Council on board too – succeed in producing a comprehensive plan which is convincing and whose aim is to provide reduced, but no less profitable, fishing activity, or alternative work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would take this report as a further direct indication of how extremely important and urgent it is to reform the European Union's common fisheries policy, a task which is occupying all of us at the moment. It is no coincidence that the individual key words – external relations, trade agreements, capacity reduction and extensive restructuring – are also a leitmotif in the working documents on the reform. The current situation in Spain and Portugal also highlights the fact that it is now high time to conclude a package which is really worthy of the name reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable to reduce members of a proud industry to the level of being simply recipients of charity. As a Community of values we must not allow this. Falling yields have, I believe, helped us to recognise the huge challenges. Let us now work together to identify the right action to take and let us show the flexibility which the rapporteur and also other colleagues have reminded us is so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall highlight three aspects in this regard: the first is that there is no sense in the rigidity that the draft regulation imposes regarding the percentage of the funding to be allocated to each type of measure. What would make sense would be to allow each Member State the flexibility, within the overall envelope, to allocate these funds according to its own needs, with clear rules. For instance, in the case of Portugal, funds for destroying vessels should be reduced and funds for restructuring some of these ships and for the social part should be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an envelope of this kind should also include funding for the economic conversion of the areas most affected by fishing, and include in this compensation framework collateral activities such as the processing industry. This would mean, right from the outset, that the financial envelope would need reinforcing, which unfortunately has not happened in this proposal by the Commission, which even so is arguing about certain problems of budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect I should like to highlight is that, in the Commission’s view, the aim of this aid is essentially to close a chapter in the common fisheries policy, which was the agreement with Morocco, without making the effort which I believe was needed to expand the fishing possibilities for these countries in third countries’ waters, and without duly providing for measures, which again were needed, to help these companies become more international more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries has tabled some amendments, and I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, who has made such an effort in this process. We, ourselves, have also tried to do our part with amendments that will clearly improve this proposal where it has gaps. As Mrs Fraga Estévez said, since there was no political ability to negotiate at the right time, I hope that there will now be dignity in the answers we are going to give to the fishermen affected. I also hope that this House will approve the proposal by the Committee on Fisheries and that the Council will do the job it has to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the vice-chairperson of the Committee on Fisheries, for her report on this extremely important regulation which aims at facilitating conversion for those thousands of fishermen and hundreds of vessels whose activity has been suddenly cancelled because it has not been possible to conclude a new fishery agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the availability of existing instruments, the Community has decided to make a special effort with a twofold initiative. Firstly, the Council regulation aiming at widening the scope of existing provisions and, secondly, additional credits for a specific action. While the proposal for additional credits is currently being discussed by the budgetary authority, today's debate focuses on the legislative proposal. The Commission welcomes the fact that the emergency procedure should allow the adoption of the regulation by the end of November instead of the end of December.</p>
<p class="contents">The report includes 18 amendments, which may be grouped in a few categories, which I shall review now. The first group consists of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 10, 11 and 13. The Commission does not believe that the land-based industries – that is to say, fish-processing factories, as well as services to vessels – ought to benefit from the new regulation, nor should the coastal regions themselves. Indeed, regional development programmes already exist, and those industries in need of conversion or those coastal communities in need of diversification should benefit from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. Aquaculture and the fish-processing industry should benefit from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of amendments consists of Amendments Nos 3 and 4. The Commission does not believe that all fishermen and vessel owners who have received indemnities in 2000-2001, irrespective of the actual duration of the cessation of activity, should benefit from the new regulation. Therefore a minimum duration of compensation, as a simple criterion, has been proposed and a nine-month duration has been considered a reasonable minimum. Moreover, until now, no evidence has been given that such a duration would penalise those who have tried to find alternative activities and are still in a difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group consists of Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8. With respect to the age of vessels to be withdrawn, the Commission has proposed to reduce the minimum age to five years in the case of the exporting of vessels. All other rules should be maintained. Moreover, the Commission has proposed that the accumulation of grants for construction should be prevented premiums for withdrawal. Any alternative rule would be against the sound management of public money, and therefore the Commission could not support those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 9 and 12, the Commission would stress that social premiums for fishermen are already available in the existing regulation. Nonetheless, it may support increasing those premiums in the new regulation. However, Spain and Portugal should guarantee that such increased premiums do not create distortion in relation to equivalent social premiums that may be available for workers of other industries in the same Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15. The additional credits are not structural funds. Providing them allows the Commission to set up some rules. Those rules should be in line with today’s priorities, which amount to scrapping redundant vessels and also to social measures. No ‘adjustment’ or ‘variation’ should be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Amendment No 16. From the Commission’s perspective, granting a joint enterprise in the fisheries sector is quite a risky action. Two legal provisions limit that risk: firstly a bank guarantee, and secondly, a partially delayed payment (that is, after two years of satisfactory operation). The budget rules for using additional credits imply the relaxation of the second provision, but the Commission is willing to maintain its financial risk at the same level. Therefore it has proposed to balance that loss by increasing the bank guarantee to 40% of the premium. But that is a purely mechanical calculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Amendment No 17. If the budgetary authority decides to earmark <span class="italic">all</span> the commitment credits dedicated to the specific action in the budgetary year 2002, the wording of that article should remain unchanged. Otherwise it should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Amendment No 18, which has no practical consequence. The wording of Article 7 should remain consistent with the wording of the equivalent articles of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission has a favourable opinion of Amendments Nos 9 and 12, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, will propose to the Fisheries Council that it includes them in the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No17 may be considered, depending upon the decision taken by the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I was speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, I am sure, will deal with any questions that I was unable to answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
