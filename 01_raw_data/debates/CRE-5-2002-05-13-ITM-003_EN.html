For the European Parliament, this means that the list of Parliament documents which will be directly accessible via the register, will need to be appended to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. This additional Annex requires approval by a regular majority of the Members. The debate on this will take place today and the vote will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The list that is before us is for the most part the result of an accurate and legal application of the Regulation. A team presided over by Parliament’s Deputy Secretary General has drawn up the initial list. In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, a small number of documents have been added whose public access is not compulsory, but desirable. I would mention the working documents, recommendations and statements of parliamentary delegations – which did not feature on the original list – the attendance lists of the plenary and committee meetings – which are, in fact, included in the Minutes and are, as such, already accessible to the public indirectly – and the list of staff of the MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I support these additions, which are also partly my own. As far as public access to the staff list is concerned, I take the view that this will, moreover, need to be in line with the Bureau’s decision of 11 June 2001, in other words Members and staff will need to take it upon themselves to add their names to the public list.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the entire list can be approved in that way. Restrictions that do not comply with the Regulation, however, cannot be accepted, because otherwise the European Court of Justice will be instructing us to add to the list again and Parliament will have lost face. With this list, the European Parliament has met all the obligations concerning the Regulation’s implementation. Does that make everything shipshape? Unfortunately not yet. Neither the European Commission nor the Council have, in our opinion, met all the conditions for implementing the Regulation. Especially where documents of third parties are concerned, for example documents of Member States or of external organisations, things could be arranged more effectively. As far as foreign and defence policies are concerned, although the Regulation has precedence over the Solana decision that was taken at the time, no final solution has yet been found for confidential and secret documents. This too will need to be provided for. In general, public access to third-party documents still poses a major problem, because in this respect, particularly the Commission and the Council are more rigid than required. In fact, Member States that still have no proper legislation in the field of public access are urgently required to lay down legislation in this area themselves as soon as possible. Objections which are still being raised by some Member States will then become redundant. It is unacceptable for public access vis-à-vis citizens in one EU country to be far greater than in another, and it is wholly unacceptable for a lack of public access in some EU countries to undermine the implementation of this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to produce a directive which obliges all EU Member States to apply more transparency and allow public access. And I will certainly make this point at the Convention on the future of Europe, of which I am a member.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it strikes me as important that we should not wait too long before this Regulation is evaluated. We have made huge progress with this Regulation, but quite a few aspects still need defending. The initial evaluation will take place at the end of this year, and I hope to be involved in this again. Those ultimately reaping the benefits of this Regulation, however, are our own citizens. They will, especially via the Internet as well, be able to call up much more information than before. This will benefit Parliament’s reputation and that of the European institutions, and it is also particularly valuable for the democracy in Europe in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our credentials for doing so will be immeasurably enhanced if our own house is in order, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, on her very open approach to this issue. We must ourselves be as open as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to two particular issues from my perspective as vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions. I support the report when it says that petitions should only be made publicly available with the consent of the petitioners. For most petitioners that is no problem, since they want as much publicity as possible, but there are occasions when they need confidentiality. For instance, if I may cite the Lloyds of London petitions, one of the so-called Names was told that if he complained to Parliament or the Commission, then any financial compensation being paid to him by Lloyds could be withdrawn – a very serious threat indeed. I cite that as an example in the public domain, but there are others.</p>
<p class="contents">That we have to push for more transparency with other institutions remains clear. Again to quote the example of the Lloyds petitions, the Commission last December announced that it was considering infringement proceedings against the British Government. The British Government responded to the Commission's letter of intent on 30 April, the very last day available, but still the Commission and the British Government refused to allow Parliament or the petitioners to know their response. I condemn that secrecy on the part of the British Government and the Commission, and I want them to be absolutely transparent, which is why we must shame them into transparency by being open ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in the discussion on the topic of democratic deficiency in Europe, transparency is one of the crucial concepts. The European population has an image of a non-transparent and undemocratic Europe, where decisions are taken behind closed doors. With the establishment of the European Convention, a very important step was recently taken towards an open and democratic Europe, partly thanks to the open dialogue which that forum enters into with organisations from civil society. It is hoped that the Heads of Government will take the Convention’s recommendations seriously at the forthcoming IGC, and that a break can be made with a long tradition of backroom politics when treaties are established. After all, we want to move towards a transparent form of European decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to documents forms an essential part of this transparency. Indeed, the exchange of information is the driving force behind the public debate in the media, public control and contributions by public organisations. This is why we, as the European Parliament, have been fighting for some time for public access to documents – not only documents from the European Parliament, but also from the Council and the Commission. My fellow MEP, Mr Cashman, in tandem with Mrs Maij-Weggen, has done a great deal of sterling work on this during a previous phase, and we are now in the follow-up phase. It is important to continue this fight until those documents of the European institutions which are currently still considered non-public are available to those who are affected by them or those who are simply interested in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maij-Weggen was right to refer to a number of aspects surrounding the Solana decision which have not yet been translated effectively into a wholesale replacement. She rightly pointed out that we want to extend the list to include a number of aspects, such as the attendance list, and that we do not want any restrictions, and we support her in this. In addition, the idea to lay down a directive – probably by adopting the minimum approach, for subsidiarity must be recognised as such and each country is to define this for themselves, so that each citizen in their own country has a minimum level of certainty with regard to access to documents – could be a very useful contribution. At the same time, we know that the Council is still finding it very hard to take its legislative decisions in public, and this would fit in very well with this continued struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking at a time when we in Europe should all be acutely aware of the importance and power of our democracy, but also of its vulnerability. We must vigorously respond to the anti-European currents which are pervading many countries, and we must do so with one voice. This is only possible, however, if – for a change – we opt for actually reducing the distance between ourselves and our electorate. The citizen must be informed more quickly and more comprehensively of legislation that applies to them, particularly the entry into force of legislation, so that their interests can be taken into consideration in good time. For example, I would suggest placing adverts in major newspapers in every country, in which the citizen is informed in clear terms of the significance a decision has for them, and which provides them with information on where they can express their protests. What will actually help the European project and our work as parliamentarians along is not only information and documents that are available passively and remain within the circle of experts, but a European citizen who is informed directly and pro-actively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would thank Maij-Weggen for her contribution, and I look forward to a fruitful cooperation, also in the follow-up phase on this score of providing information to citizens across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparency is the area in which Mrs Maij-Weggen manifestly excels, and I wish to congratulate her on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be observed that Parliament takes the lead when it comes to efforts to open up our institutions. Our documents and activities are openly available to the people of Europe. We are an open institution with open meetings. I believe that we are one of the world’s most transparent parliaments, both through our conscious commitment to formal decision-making and through unconventional methods such as the ‘Open Up Europe’ initiative taken by a number of liberal MEPs or the decision to put MEPs’ financial interests on the Web in accordance with the name and shame principle. Through methods such as these, transparency can be achieved. What is happening in the European Parliament can now be followed on computers from northern Finland to the Greek islands.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, a lot more to be done, however. It is also a question of ensuring that there are clear rules so that access to documents is not dependent upon discretion or the sympathetic interpretation of an application. The register is therefore an important tool for ensuring that people know what applies and how they can appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The document should perhaps make clear what further increased openness it is leading to. How in fact are documents from third parties or Member States or those forming part of an official correspondence to be dealt with? There is scope for interpretation in these areas. I hope that Parliament’s employees in general will interpret all applications generously and that we shall soon have reports on how many applications are rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to documents and across-the-board transparency are prerequisites for confidence in the EU’s activities. I really do hope that the Commission and the Council will have their registers in order by 3 June and that, shortly after that, we can begin the evaluation which is prescribed by Article 255 and which is to be ready in a year and a half’s time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for having drawn up a complete list of those documents the European Parliament must make directly accessible to the public. I want to say that Mrs Malmström is absolutely right when she says that transparency can and must extend from Finland to Greece; this really is no longer just a Nordic concept. I would, however, like to say that our new regulation on transparency perhaps incorporates just one feature which is a very Nordic tradition, which is that there are registers of documents. For a long time, people in Finland, Sweden and Denmark have been able to go, for example, to the municipal registrar’s office, the public register, and see what sort of documents were held there – and, obviously, they still can.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have the Internet and we can introduce this process in the European Parliament. We can only hope that all the institutions agree that we should endeavour to create one single document register in which documents from all the institutions are indeed directly accessible for as long as possible, and in this way we really will be making decision-making more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, realise that this will still be a great struggle for us. This week we are having another very important debate on this subject, as we are discussing with Mr Solana the issue of Council reform and transparency, where we will have to defend, for example, the broad definition of legislation. We cannot settle for a situation where only documents connected with the codecision procedure would be accessible to the public, but must try to ensure that all documents that relate to different decisions binding on Member States are accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly want to thank the rapporteur for having included a list of Members’ assistants, as they carry out public duties in their capacity as assistants to the Members of Parliament. It is high time we pointed out that these names are not secret; they are not secret individuals, and their names may indeed be made known to the public. Parliament thus also takes the view that, while, on the one hand, the protection of privacy is obviously important, on the other hand, the common interest and the right of access to information also require names to be made public, subject to certain conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as regards the future, there may be something missing from the list of documents to be made public, for I feel that the question of audiovisual recordings is fundamental and that we should make increasing use of them in Parliament. In my opinion, we should make it compulsory for audiovisual recordings to be made of committee work as well – the costs are not excessive – and then treat the recordings as documents to be made public and made available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a key point. Our meetings have to be public under the Rules of Procedure. However, this is only the theory: we know that, in practice, a European citizen walking into Parliament off the street would not be allowed to attend our meetings without an invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Publishing audiovisual recordings of our work on the Internet is a key form of publicity for our institutions. Moreover, with the Stenmarck report which we are going to debate tomorrow, we are already addressing the issue of budget cover from Parliament’s point of view. I will tell you now that, tomorrow, together with 55 Members of all the political groups, we are going to table a resolution calling, not least, upon the members of the European Convention to introduce a Treaty reform enshrining the right of access to all the public meetings of our institutions in the Treaties: the right of access, including access via the Internet, to all the meetings and democratic instruments of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this is the way to go, for it will enable Parliament to fully exploit new technologies to publicise its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, today, you go into modern search engines, you find 223 000 examples of its German equivalent in less than ten minutes. No one would confuse the words ‘transparent’ and ‘perspirant’. ‘Transparent’ is what your shirt may be, while ‘perspiration’ is what is sometimes seen under the arms. If you search for ‘transparency’ and ‘European Parliament’ you find just 908 examples and, if you ask people out and about what they associate with ‘transparency’, they say it is what we still do not want to make transparent. Moral: transparency which does not also bring the right people out in a sweat is worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">If this report now talks in terms of a milestone’s having been reached on the road to more transparency in the European Union, that is something I would contest. It is more than just nothing, but it is not much more than a pebble. What we really need is transparency that is actually experienced. A European transparency initiative – of the kind I have talked about on a number of occasions in Parliament – is in the process of being developed. It goes beyond the self-congratulation syndrome of the European institutions and is aimed at making, if at all possible, all documents – even those in which people are really interested – publicly accessible. On the basis of Regulation 201/204, we urgently need this examination that has already been talked about. If we are concerned to be credible rather than hypocritical, I think our aim must be to do everything we can to copy the freedom of information act in what will hopefully be a future United States of Europe. We can also learn more from Sweden in this area. We all of us know that there is no democracy without transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The commitments made by the Commission in this area support this statement and, of these, I would like to remind you of the commitment relating to the communication to this House of the so-called commitology documents, a commitment which goes further than our obligations laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. This confirms our will to move forward and make greater progress, both in terms of transparency and in terms of interinstitutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you will agree with me that this cooperation is particularly important in the field of access to documents, given the complexity of our working method and the interaction of our activities; and it is precisely within the framework of this interinstitutional cooperation, organised by means of the already established interinstitutional committee, that the essential mechanisms must be agreed for consultation with the institution originally responsible for the documents whose disclosure is proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, turning to the specific issue which is the subject of this debate, the Commission welcomes and supports Parliament’s initiative in relation to direct accessibility of documents. Nevertheless, insofar as the report presented by Mrs Maij-Weggen proposes the disclosure of a list of documents from other institutions without including any mechanism for prior consultation of the other institution, the Commission prefers that it make a general reference to documents communicated by the other institutions in relation to the rules in force and the procedures agreed to provide a framework for communication, instead of establishing a list of communicable documents. In our opinion, this sufficiently guarantees both the objectives of Parliament and the Commission in the field of transparency and compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 in relation to which – as I pointed out before – we are already taking steps which go beyond what is required.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen on the work she has done as well as all the other speakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
