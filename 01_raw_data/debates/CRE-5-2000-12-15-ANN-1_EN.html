<p>With regard to the question asked by Mr Clegg, I must point out that the Council has no position on the high-level consultative group referred to by the honourable Member in his question. The meeting he mentioned was a multilateral ministerial meeting, not a Council session.</p>
<p>I would add that the Council is not aware of any plans to create an independent agency capable of carrying out assessments of the impact of draft EU legislative proposals before their formal adoption. Such assessments are already an integral part of the Council's consideration of draft proposals.</p>
<p>My answer to Mr Ford's question is that the Council does not have the power to ask the European Parliament to appoint a representative to serve on the consultative group.</p>
<p>I can nevertheless assure the honourable Member that the Council is going to look into ways of assessing the financial implications of EU proposals within the context of a coordinated strategy, on the basis of the proposals which the Commission presents in 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0924"></a>

<p>The Commission's progress report on the applicant countries points out that a shortcoming of the Romanian democratic system is that so much of the incorporation of Community legislation into national law is done by way of decrees or urgent decrees.</p>

<p>In December 1997, the Luxembourg European Council established the principle that the applicant countries' respect for the Copenhagen political criteria - namely stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the respect for and protection of minorities - is a prior condition for the opening of any accession negotiations. The fact that, in December 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to open negotiations with Romania, amongst other countries, indicates that the European Union considered that, generally speaking, Romania meets these criteria.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is nothing left to do. The most recent Commission regular report, presented last November, highlights a whole series of areas in which Romania needs to make substantial progress. Some of these areas relate to the Copenhagen political criteria, and these include the issue of increased recourse to ordinances, as mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>It is true that the regular report, as such, is only the Commission’s opinion. However, the General Affairs Council held on 4 and 5 December has just adopted conclusions on the progress of the enlargement process, in which it welcomes the quality of the information transmitted by the Commission and considers that the regular reports are a necessary tool for monitoring each candidate country's preparations for accession. Clearly, therefore, the Commission will follow extremely closely the progress made by Romania in the future in the areas covered by the Commission regular report. The Union has the necessary tools to do this, in particular within the framework of the European Association Agreement and its bodies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0927"></a>

<p>Mr Aldo Ajello was appointed European Union special envoy in the African Great Lakes region in 1996. His assignment was to support efforts to create the necessary conditions for the lasting, peaceful resolution of the crises affecting the region, by means which would include preparing an international conference on peace, stability, democracy and development in the African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>During its debate on the conflicts in Africa on 22 May 2000, the Council declared that it actively supported Mr Ajello's work. Each year, the Council has voted unanimously to extend his mandate.</p>
<p>In view of the current state of the peace process in the DRC and in Burundi, and the many summits and meetings (Lusaka, Windhoek, Kinshasa, Tripoli, Maputo I and II, Arusha) which have taken place in recent weeks, and in view of the role which the special envoy can play in mediating and providing information, the Council feels completely justified in extending Mr Ajello's mandate.</p>
<p>It was the Congolese concerned (government, armed and non-violent opposition) who appointed Mr Ketumile Masire "facilitator" of the inter-Congolese dialogue. On 22 May 2000, the Council stated that it supported the inter-Congolese facilitator politically. Moreover, it welcomed the support already promised or provided by the Member States and the Commission and called upon them to examine the possibility of lending the facilitator further financial and logistic support. It is not for the Council to decide whether Mr Ketumile should continue in this role.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to the resumption of structural aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Development Fund Committee recently issued a favourable opinion on the strategy document proposed by the Commission. It will hence be possible to open negotiations with the Congolese authorities with a view to signing a National Indicative Programme.</p>
<p>In its statement of 22 September 2000, the European Union called upon the governments of Uganda and Rwanda to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1304 immediately and to implement the proposals for redeploying troops in the DRC.</p>
<p>The restoration of the integrity of the DRC and the other States involved in the conflict is a priority policy for the Council. The EU's main objective remains the creation of conditions which will make it possible to achieve lasting resolution of the conflicts affecting the region. This resolution will, of necessity, have to lay down respect for international law and international principles, security guarantees for all people, an end to impunity and respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0934"></a>

<p>The Greek press reports that there are only 250 public health inspectors in Greece, whereas the country needs at least 1000 in order to safeguard consumers' health as Greece is a net importer of meat products from within and outside the European Union. In addition to the shortage of personnel, allegations have emerged that inspections of meat and other imported produce are inadequate as they are carried out on a five-day basis and only during civil servants' eight-hour working day, whereas the largest quantities are imported at times when no inspection is possible. The Greek State Secretary for Agriculture acknowledged the laxity of the inspections when he referred to 'occasional' checks being carried out and only on weekdays.</p>
<p>What action will the Commission take to compel the Greek authorities to increase the number of staff and inspections to ensure that public health in Greece is effectively protected?

<p>Since May 2000, the Human Rights Committee of the Turkish National Assembly has published new reports on the conditions in Turkish prisons and police stations. These reports indicate improvements that have been made between 1998 and 2000, particularly with regard to the attitudes of police and prison staff. They also strongly criticise the absence of monitoring and inspection of the system by governors and prosecutors. However, the prison conditions are still worrying. The fact that this debate has begun in Turkey is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>It is also notable that the authorities are currently carrying out a restructuring of the entire prison system (the construction of a new type of prison, the gradual compliance with international minimum standards, collaboration with the Committee for the Prevention of Torture).</p>
<p>The Council has always been sensitive to the situation in Turkish prisons. This issue is included in the Accession Partnership which was the subject of a political agreement with the Council on 4 December 2000. The improvement of prison conditions is included in the short- and medium-term priorities and objectives within the framework of enhanced political dialogue and political criteria. The guarantee of the right to freedom of opinion and freedom of expression, in relation to political and religious issues, is also part of the short- and medium-term political criteria.

According to the protocol on rules of origin in the association agreement, Israel is allowed a maximum of ten months to communicate the results of verifications which it is carrying out with a view to ensuring that the documents are authentic and that the products can be considered to be original and to satisfy the requirements of the protocol.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the desire to increase the transparency of common trade policy and democratic control by Parliament.</p>
<p>In fact, the involvement of Parliament not only conforms to the concept of European construction but is also a necessary supplement to the democratic control which national parliaments exercise over the governments of the Member States. Furthermore, it strengthens the Community’s negotiation position with regard to third countries. In fact, those countries know that the Commission negotiates with the full support of the democratically elected representatives of the European citizens.</p>
<p>That is why, as the honourable Member will know, the Commission had proposed the revision of Article 133 within the framework of the current Intergovernmental Conference. In particular, its proposal, which is supported by the European Parliament, intended Parliament to be closely involved in all the stages of commercial policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these proposals have not been accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference. The Commission must therefore continue to do its best to ensure that Parliament is closely involved while respecting, of course, the framework laid down in the Treaty.</p>

<p>At the end of October, 11 banks signed an agreement aimed at preventing criminal organisations from using banks to launder money and in so doing agreed a code of conduct which will place the burden of responsibility for checking the authenticity of the money they receive on the banks. Private bankers in Geneva have dismissed the idea as a public relations exercise. What is the Commission's response to this new code and does it consider that such an initiative could have helped to thwart the efforts of former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha to launder almost £3 billion in UK and other banks, and will it request that the results of the investigation by the (London) City's Financial Services Authority into the destination of part of these funds is made public and, where possible, followed up at EU level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of, and welcomes, the Global Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines for Private Banking (also known as the "Wolfsberg Principles"), which were endorsed by 11 leading international banks at the end of October.</p>
<p>This appears to be a significant initiative given the public commitment of the prominent banks which have signed up to the principles and the involvement of Transparency International and respected international experts. The Guidelines pay particular attention to the risks involved in providing private banking services to high net-worth individuals, certain of whom may be public officials or have close links with such officials. The Commission has no information on the views of other private bankers. However, it believes that there is an increasingly wide international consensus that all countries and the whole of the financial sector must participate actively in the global fight against money laundering.</p>
<p>Having originated as part of the effort to combat drugs trafficking, the campaign against money laundering has recently become increasingly broad-based as regards the underlying criminality the proceeds of which are targeted.</p>
<p>Within the Community, the Common Position adopted by the Council on 30 November 2000 on the proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money laundering directive requires the Member States to oblige their financial sector and other professions to report their suspicions of the laundering of a wider range of serious crime, including corruption.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that this extension, together with the publicity given to cases of high-level corruption and stolen public assets, and the resulting public revulsion at such cases, will make banks even more careful as regards the origin of their clients' funds. Failure to apply adequate know-your-customer principles and to ask the necessary questions expose them not only to a serious reputational risk but also to disciplinary measures or even prosecution.</p>
<p>With regard to the Abacha case in particular, the Commission is aware that the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) is carrying out an investigation into the procedures followed at the banks which appear to have handled the funds in question. The FSA has stated that remedial action will be ordered where problems are found and that any evidence of criminal activity will be passed to the relevant criminal prosecution authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0943"></a>

<p>Counterfeiting is of concern to the Commission because it has negative consequences on the proper functioning of the Single Market, including on innovation, employment and competitiveness. In addition, it misleads consumers and, in certain cases, puts public health and safety at risk. It also creates a barrier for European exports and investment in third countries.</p>
<p>To prevent counterfeit goods from being placed on the Community market, the Commission has taken a number of initiatives aiming to ensure the effective protection of intellectual property rights. These initiatives are general in nature and do not apply to particular types of products.</p>
<p>As regards the control of the external border of the Community, Council Regulation (EC) No 3295/94, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 241/1999, laying down measures concerning the entry into the Community and the export and re-export from the Community of goods infringing certain intellectual property rights, aims to prevent the passage of counterfeit and pirated goods through the external borders of the Community. This Regulation allows the national customs authorities to suspend the release of goods suspected of being counterfeit or pirated while the right holder instigates infringement proceedings before the national court.</p>
<p>As regards the Internal Market, the Commission adopted on 30 November 2000 a follow-up communication to its 1998 Green Paper on Combating Counterfeiting and Piracy in the Single Market. This Communication contains an Action Plan announcing a series of practical measures aiming to improve and strengthen the fight against this phenomenon in the single Market. This Action Plan will be implemented progressively and will involve all the parties concerned. As part of these measures, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a Directive harmonising the legislation of Member States on the means of enforcing intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework, the Community monitors the way in which WTO members implement the agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS), which establishes minimum standards of protection and lays down procedures for ensuring their effective enforcement. The Community also negotiates bilateral agreements with WTO and non-WTO members, which require a high level of protection and fighting against infringements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0861"></a>

<p>A process is under way in Greece to revise Article 24 of the country's constitution concerning the protection of the natural environment with the inherent risk that this will pave the way for the removal of the protected status of woodland and its use for building. Obviously, the revision of a country's constitution is a matter solely for that country but, by ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam (Articles 2, 174, 152 and 153), Greece has made certain specific commitments in this respect. Furthermore, there is a risk that the ostensible 'improvement' of Article 24 might nullify the 5<span class="sup">th</span> action programme on the environment and sustainable development, the 1992 Rio Declaration, certain specific provisions of Greek national legislation as well as international and Community rules incorporated into that legislation at a time when woodland in Greece is becoming increasingly scarce among the chaos already typical of town and country planning in Greece.</p>
<p>In the light of these circumstances, does the Commission consider that the revision of this controversial article – which has provoked a storm of protests from environmental organisations, associations, other bodies and eminent legal experts – is consistent with its environmental protection policy, and will it make recommendations to the relevant Greek authorities to persuade them to respect the obligations which they themselves have entered into, and the conclusions adopted as the outcome of various international procedures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community has a restrictive attitude to providing financial assistance to Belarus on account of the political situation. However, support for education and civil society are compatible with Community policy defined by the Council on 15 September 1997.</p>
<p>In particular, there are two possible channels within the Tacis Programme for which the YMCA may bid for Community funding for educational activities in Belarus. The first is the Tacis Civil Society Development Programme for Belarus which should start at the end of this year. It will provide EUR 600,000 for so-called micro-projects submitted by Belarusian non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The second is the new Tacis Institutional Building Partnership Programme which will start operating throughout the NIS from next year in support of civil society and partnerships between Community and NIS (Belarusian) NGOs. Details on how to apply for these funds are available either from Directorates General for External relations and "Service commun des relations extérieures" Relex or the SCR in Brussels and the Tacis Branch Office in Minsk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0874"></a>

<p>The complaint in question was examined by the Commission.

<p>At present, the infringement procedure in question is still at an early stage and no application has been made to the Court of Justice in this case. Therefore it would be premature to presume that a sanction will be imposed on the Member State in question with regard to this case.

<p>The Commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the United Kingdom Government on 8 November 2000 was the introduction of some form of road user charge, such as a ‘vignette’, payable by all road hauliers, British and non- British alike, for their use of the road network in the United Kingdom. There is therefore no suspicion of the announced measure introducing direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the haulier or the origin or destination of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Provided that the details of its implementation respect all relevant rules and in particular the requirement of non-discrimination, direct or indirect, such a charge seems to be in line with current Community law, Directive 1999/62/EC<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>. This Directive, adopted by unanimity in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply (time related) user charges or motorway tolls. The overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the Community internal market.</p>
<p>By 1995, 12 out of the 15 Member States have adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis put on direct charging (user charges or motorway tolls) and less on taxes. The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems, which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network. The measures announced by the United Kingdom signal such a re-adjustment of its charging system.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the above mentioned Directive provides for the possibility of special arrangements to be made for border areas by the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission is following closely the development of the British scheme, which will be subject to a consultation procedure, in order to ensure its full compatibility with Community general principles and specific legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It is too early to undertake a full assessment of the Community support for emergency and re-construction following the floods in 2000 in Mozambique. However, close coordination on the ground involving the Commission Delegation and the ECHO staff seconded to Maputo, has allowed the Community interventions to target the most critical needs. Several field missions have checked the situation and the implementation of projects, and measures have been taken, where necessary, to improve delivery of aid. At the same time, the use of flexible and accelerated procedures has allowed rapid disbursement of funds.</p>
<p>The Commission's assessment is that the 2000 floods will have a relatively important knock-on effect in the economy, resulting in a slowing down of growth and increased inflation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0887"></a>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the problems related to the control of classical swine fever.</p>
<p>Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve the situation, including the financing of a large-scale laboratory trial on the recently developed “marker vaccines”.</p>
<p>Very recently, on 15 September 2000, the Commission made a proposal for a new Directive on the control of swine fever, which takes into account the lessons learned from the outbreaks, which recently occurred in Europe and the development of new vaccines.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission’s proposal includes provisions on vaccination, which are fully in agreement with the opinion delivered by the Scientific Committee on this issue in 1997.</p>
<p>A return to a generalised preventive vaccination policy is not foreseen by the Scientific Committee and by the Commission’s proposal for three main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason concerns the questionable results of a policy of preventive vaccination as regards the protection of the pig population in the Community.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the ban of preventive vaccination, the number of outbreaks of classical swine fever has decreased in the last decade, although slightly, in comparison with the previous ten years when vaccination had been widely used.</p>
<p>The second reason regards the high costs of a generalised vaccination policy.</p>
<p>If this policy was applied in the Community, more than 200 million pigs should be vaccinated each year. The cost of vaccination would probably exceed EUR 100 million per year.</p>
<p>Finally, the consequences on the export of pigs and pig products from the Community in the case of swine fever vaccination, must be taken into account.</p>
<p>The trade of vaccinated pigs and their meat cannot occur freely at international level as the vaccinated animals, if infected with classical swine fever virus, might act as apparently healthy virus carriers and further spread the disease.</p>
<p>At this moment, the degree of self-sufficiency of the Community in the pig sector is about 107%. In the case of vaccination, serious restrictions to exports would be applied by many of the Commission's trade partners, particularly by the most important ones such as the United States where vaccination is banned. As a consequence, the whole pig sector in the Community would suffer in such a very serious crisis.</p>
<p>However, the new proposal of the Commission includes provisions on the potential use of marker vaccines, in the framework of the current non-vaccination policy.</p>
<p>This policy already foresees the possibility for an emergency vaccination after an outbreak of disease, if there is the risk that the situation goes out of control.</p>
<p>In principle, the marker vaccines might allow the discrimination between vaccinated and healthy pigs and the vaccinated but infected ones. The trade of the animals recognised as not infected, as well as of their products, might then take place. This might allow a more extensive use of vaccination with these vaccines.</p>
<p>However, there are still a number of technical problems to be solved, as shown by the trial supported by the Commission. These problems are related to the efficacy of the currently available marker vaccines in emergency situations, as well as on the reliability of the accompanying discriminatory tests.</p>
<p>Therefore, the approach of the Commission on the use of these vaccines is rather cautious.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to make a preventive vaccination field trial, as it is not possible to predict in which area of the Community the next outbreak of classical swine fever will occur.</p>
<p>Only in this case, the efficacy of a preventive vaccination might be properly evaluated. In addition, the pigs located in the area where such a trial was carried out would be subject to certain restrictions to trade, at least until the results of the trial suggest that preventive vaccination is not harmful for the remaining pigs of the Community.</p>
<p>For these reasons, any field trial in the Community is not feasible, unless one wishes to consider as a trial an attempt to control the disease in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>The international press reports that the Algerian Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Yazid Zerhouni, refuses – in violation of the procedures provided in law for setting up political associations and parties – to recognise the WAFA party led by the former minister, Ahmed Taleb, which has been set up in full compliance with current legislation. This party, which aims to reconcile Islam and the modern world and which could make a significant contribution towards reviving the country's ailing democracy and, therefore, strengthening the rule of law, finds itself subjected to a ban on the well-worn pretext that it would represent 'a threat to State security'.</p>
<p>What initiatives has the Commission taken, or will it take, to persuade the Algerian authorities to respect their own laws and thereby also promote the revival of democratic debate and the political process, thus enabling Algeria to emerge from the serious crisis in which it finds itself?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the Algerian Government has refused to authorise the creation of the WAFA political party on the grounds that this was nothing more than an underhand attempt to resurrect the dissolved former Front Islamique du Salut party. Confronted with the government’s resolve, Mr Taleb did not persist in founding the party and did not instigate any legal proceedings against the government's decision.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, political issues are raised in dialogue between the Algerian authorities and the European Union. This political dialogue takes place at ministerial level, twice a year in principle and whenever necessary in Algiers, involving the Member States' ambassadors and the Commission representative. When the current negotiations leading to an Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria have been completed, and when this agreement has been ratified by both parties, political dialogue will obviously take on an institutional dimension which is lacking at present. Moreover, in line with the customary terms of association agreements, respect for human rights and democracy will become crucial components of Euro-Algerian relations. In this respect, it must be emphasised that the European Parliament, through its resolutions and interparliamentary meetings, contributes significant added value to the political dialogue between the European Union and its partners of the South and East Mediterranean.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0893"></a>

<p>The Commission very regularly visits all Member States to verify on-the-spot the application of all bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) related Community legislation. Inadequate application has been observed in some instances. Such observations have led to amendment of Community legislation, to commitments from the Member States to correct the shortcomings, to follow-up inspections or to starting of infringement proceedings.</p>
<p>With respect to the enforcement of the ban on meat-and-bone meal Community rules for control of certain processed animal protein into ruminant feed entered into force in July 1994. However, cases of BSE have been recorded in animals born in 1995 and later years in certain Member States.</p>
<p>Community inspections have identified systematic failures in the implementation of Community rules in several Member States. Certain Member States have also reported deficiencies in their implementation of Community legislation on animal feed and have, as a consequence, adopted safeguard measures.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, as a precautionary measure, the Commission proposed a temporary prohibition on the use of all animal protein in animal feed, pending a total re-evaluation of the implementation of Community legislation in Member States. This prohibition was adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 4 December 2000.</p>
<p>On the extension of the BSE testing programme to all Member States, a reinforcement of the Community wide measures has been adopted since the question was tabled. As of 1 January 2001, all bovine animals over 30 months of age subject to special emergency slaughter or showing symptoms of (any) disease at normal slaughter must be tested. In addition the number of random tested dead-on-farm cattle has been increased. The requirement to test will be extended from 1 July 2001 to all cattle aged over 30 months slaughtered for human consumption. The Agriculture Council of 4 December further agreed, that a "purchase for destruction" scheme should be introduced to remove from the food chain all cattle aged over 30 months unless tested negative for BSE.</p>
<p>As regards the application of the precautionary principle the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member of the comprehensive proposal on food law, recently transmitted to the Parliament and to the Council. One of its important elements is indeed the establishment of the precautionary principle in Community food safety legislation. In short this principle dictates that Community risk management measures need to be taken whenever a risk to health is identified but scientific uncertainty persists.</p>
<p>On the international stage, the Commission has insisted that consideration is given to the precautionary principle in Codex Alimentarius. Discussions are still underway.</p>
<p>As far as oilseeds and protein crops are concerned, the honourable Member will be aware of the commitment entered into at the last Agricultural Council, and indeed confirmed at the Nice European Council meeting. The Commission will rapidly analyse the supply and demand for oilseed and protein crops and will communicate its conclusions to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>No countries other than the United Kingdom and Portugal have been declared to be particularly at risk. For these two Member States special Community measures are in place, notably the embargo on live cattle, meat-and-bone meal and beef based products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0896"></a>

Since the imposition of sanctions 600 000 children below five years of age have died, while 6 000 children are dying every month from hunger and illness owing to the tragic lack of food and medicine.

<p>The Commission is as concerned as the honourable Member about the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people and in particular on the children of Iraq. But let us be clear. This suffering is the result of the continued Iraqi refusal to accept UNSCR 1284 and to cooperate with the UN. In doing so, the Iraqi Government carries full responsibility for delaying the lifting of sanctions.</p>
<p>Of course the Commission would like to see a return to normality in Iraq. Ways should therefore be pursued to engage the Iraqi Government in a dialogue on the implementation of and compliance with UNSC resolutions so that sanctions can be lifted. But ultimately, the decision to lift sanctions remains with the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The Commission follows the humanitarian situation in Iraq closely. The Commission continues to try to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people through the humanitarian aid provided.</p>
<p>Since the Gulf war in 1991, the Community has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq with over EUR 251 million. An amount of EUR 8.5 million has been allocated from the 2000 ECHO budget. The Commission is, however, concerned about the restrictions imposed by the Iraqi Government on non-governmental (NGO) operations, which may jeopardise the implementation of ECHO financed humanitarian aid programmes in Iraq.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0898"></a>

<p>With reference to Mr Moscovici’s answer to my question and supplementary question of 14 November (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0854_EN.html">H-0854/00</a>), it remains entirely obscure why the Council thinks that the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments will in itself do anything to secure due fulfilment of the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, now repeated in Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter.</p>
<p>I refer to guarantees such as the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one’s own choosing or, if one has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; to have the free assistance of an interpreter if one cannot understand or speak the language used in court; right to trial within a reasonable time, or to release pending trial.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share the Council’s apparently groundless confidence that mutual recognition of judgments is likely to be of any value in raising standards in this domain? Will it consider the desirability of a delay in relation to mutual recognition pending adequate observance of existing guarantees? Does it agree that there is now an historic opportunity to move towards general adoption of ‘best practice’ standards? Could one justifiably speak of an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ on any other basis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the two issues of mutual recognition of judgements on the one hand and respect for the rights of the parties of the procedure, but also of third persons, such as the victims of crimes over which criminal procedures are held on the other hand are very closely linked.</p>
<p>The Commission thus very much welcomes the fact that the conclusions of the Tampere European Council in the chapter dealing with “mutual recognition of judicial decisions” several times make reference to the latter question: Conclusion no. 34 speaks of “minimum standards on specific aspects of civil procedural law”, conclusion no. 35 asks for transfer of persons who are fleeing from justice to be done “in compliance with Article 6 TEU”, and the same conclusion demands that fast track extradition is to be accomplished “without prejudice to the principle of fair trial”. Finally, conclusion no. 37 asks for work to be launched on those aspects of procedural law on which common minimum standards are considered necessary in order to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition”.</p>
<p>It would thus appear that the Tampere European Council has clearly steered the Union towards a system in which while decisions are to be allowed a much greater “freedom of movement”, these same decisions will have to come out of procedures that satisfy certain standards. Some of these standards may exist already, some may still have to be established.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0903"></a>

<p>Within the European support programme for the peace-process in Colombia, the overall amount of programmable Community aid that the Commission will make available for Colombia over the period 2000-2006 is 105 M&#x80;.

Emphasis will also be put on tackling a series of structural problems in the country; and in particular, political, social and economic reforms.</p>
<p>The Community-approach to combating drugs is based on the principle of ‘shared responsibility’ between producer and consumer countries. It is based on incentives for changing from illicit to licit crops. This is the purpose of several alternative development projects in Latin America funded by the Commission. Indeed, alternative development is clearly a priority within the European Support Programme for the peace-process in Colombia: in the recent Commission Communication on a multi-annual support programme for Colombia, a tentative amount of EUR 30 m has been allocated for alternative development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0904"></a>

This includes of course the Water Framework Directive, and Community legislation concerning the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora as well as environmental impact assessments.</p>
<p>At this stage, the plan still being a draft document, it would be premature to presume conflicts between the Plan and existing Community legislation or policy.

<p>What is the current state of EU/US negotiations on an ‘Open Skies’ aviation agreement?</p>
<p>Does the Commission recognise that such an agreement could result in predatory airlines cherry-picking major routes?</p>
<p>Furthermore, is the Commission aware that such an agreement could have a devastating effect on certain airports and their economic hinterland, such as Shannon in Ireland, which have already experienced major difficulties as a result of the abolition of intra-EU duty-free?</p>
<p>Common Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is not at this stage negotiating with the United States on “open skies”. The Commission has, already in 1995, proposed to the Council to agree on a common position towards the United States with the aim to conclude a so-called Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA), which would establish an open, competitive air transport market based on a convergent and harmonised regulatory environment, similar to the one which currently contains the internal Community air transport market. The Council is currently considering this proposal which increasingly is gaining support both on an industrial and political level.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that her proposal creates a fair and level competitive playing field between the Community and the United States and would thus contain the best possible commercial environment for all United States and European stakeholders; i.e. airlines, workers, consumers and airports alike. This European approach of the transatlantic relations has to be appreciated in a context of traffic growth and airport congestion and then will permit a more efficient utilisation of all the airport capacities.</p>
<p>How and when the final arrangement shall take shape, will depend on the discussion in the Council and the possible negotiations with the United States, when such negotiations will ultimately be held. The Commission is well aware that the situation regarding particular airports, like e.g. Shannon, would require specific attention and has already expressed in the Council its readiness to take into account the effects of the present bilateral agreement between Ireland ant the United States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The case to which the honourable Member refers is Case C-117/00, Commission v Ireland and inter alia concerns Ireland's compliance with Article 3 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> in relation to the Red Grouse, Lagopus lagopus.</p>
<p>Article 3 provides that, in the light of a number of requirements (ecological, scientific, cultural, economic and recreational), Member States shall take the requisite measures to preserve, maintain or re-establish a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for all wild bird species.</p>
<p>While certain species of wild bird (those listed in Annex I of the directive as well as those that regularly migrate) benefit from the more specific habitat conservation requirements of Article 4 of the directive, this is not the case for Lagopus lagopus. Hence the importance and relevance of Article 3. As the honourable Member correctly indicates, Lagopus lagopus is huntable under the terms of the directive, being listed in Annex II. However, this case does not relate to hunting of Lagopus lagopus. Moreover, the fact that a species is huntable does not necessarily imply that its habitats are unthreatened, or that they do not require preservation, maintenance or re-establishment. Good conservation and management of habitats would indeed benefit recreational uses such as hunting.</p>
<p>The distribution of Lagopus lagopus is naturally restricted by the species' intimate dependence for food and nesting on heather moorland. A study of Lagopus lagopus in Scotland notes: "Heavy grazing reduces heather cover, standing crop, shoot production and perhaps most important, the heather's carbohydrate reserves.

<p>In its recent report on shipbuilding in the world, the Commission concludes that the European market is still beset by considerable problems thanks to South Korea's dumping practices, which have driven prices down and led to a loss of orders for European shipyards to the benefit of their South Korean counterparts.

Nonetheless, it appears to remain committed to ending the system of state aids to shipbuilding at the end of 2000, despite the opposition of a number of Member States which have expressed their willingness to prolong these aids.</p>

<p>The Commission fully shares the honourable Member’s concern about unfair South Korean practices.</p>
<p>In its report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 had not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices. However, among the various actions proposed, it committed itself to examine, as soon as possible, the possibilities to propose measures to address the Korean problem in accordance with the Regulation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, at its meeting on 29 November 2000, the Commission reaffirmed that it is against any prolongation of operating aid. It also indicated that if, in the framework of the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR) procedure, it does not achieve a negotiated solution with Korea satisfactory for the Community, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in order to seek remedy against unfair Korean practices. In addition the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure. This mechanism will be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that Community industry has been directly injured by unfair Korean trade practices.</p>
<p>The Commission also declared its willingness to allow greater use of State aid for research and development (R&amp;D) in the shipbuilding sector and recalled that substantial funding is also available under the Community research framework programme. In addition Community shipyards will continue to be able to benefit from other aid possibilities such as investment aid for innovation, regional investment aid for the modernisation of existing shipyards, as well as restructuring and closure aid, where necessary, to help in the process of structural adjustment and reconversion to other activities.</p>
<p>These views were presented to the Industry Council on 5 December 2000, which welcomed the Commission’s determination to tackle the problem of unfair Korean competition and took note of the Commission’s proposals in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0922"></a>

<p>The honourable Member will be aware that the new law governing public investment and the structural funds in Greece was approved on 31 October 2000. Moreover, the Community Support Framework for Greece for the 2000-06 programming period was signed on 27 November 2000. This means that two important steps forward have now been taken.</p>
<p>As regards the Cohesion Fund, the Greek authorities have submitted during the recent weeks a substantial number of alternative project proposals. It has also been possible to clarify the technical content of several projects that were problematic. As a result, the prospects for full use of the commitment credits available to Greece are much improved, subject of course to the final stages of internal consultations.</p>
<p>The difficulties with some of the Cohesion Fund proposals should be seen as start up problems at the beginning of a new funding period. The Commission will work with the Greek administration from the beginning of next year to ensure a smooth examination of Cohesion Fund projects in future.</p>
<p>Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the next step is the approval of operational programmes. The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the basic elements of the new management structures required by the Structural Fund Regulations will be in place and operational by January or February 2000, including the management information system. In these circumstances, a first set of operational programmes should be ready for approval at that time with the first payments of Community credits following immediately after.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0928"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member’s point of view regarding the special significance of the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004, since the Games are to be held in the country that was the cradle of the ancient Olympic spirit.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games provide the host country – and Barcelona and Albertville in 1992 were an excellent illustration of this – with an opportunity to project its image worldwide. From this point of view, the Games can have a stimulating effect on the host country’s economy. This is the reason why it has been possible to cofinance extensive redevelopment works in the Attic region under the Structural Funds. It is likely that, in the new programming period 2000-2006, a number of infrastructure projects will prove indirectly useful to the organisation and conducting of the Olympic Games, even though the main criterion for their selection was their positive impact on the long-term socio-economic development of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for sport has made contact with the Greek authorities in order to look into a possible collaboration with a view to giving the Games a European dimension, including in terms of cultural aspects to which the Commission attaches great importance. Avenues for cooperation are being examined by both parties and the Commission hopes to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with the Greek Government and the organising committee.</p>
<p>By way of example, the Commissioner responsible for sport has already launched the idea of making the Athens Olympic Games exemplary in the area of combating drugs in sport. Furthermore, as she has already announced before this Chamber, on 7 September 2000, the Commission is considering the possibility of proposing that the year 2004 be declared the ‘European Year of Sport’ in order to highlight the importance of this activity for European society.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0929"></a>

<p>On the basis of the information provided, the Commission can state the following:</p>
<p>All protective equipment worn by rugby players is covered by Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This Directive is compulsory. All the personal protective equipment it covers must satisfy to its Essential Health and Safety Requirements and bear the CE marking.</p>
<p>The CE marking is the only compulsory marking for PPE. It is a graphical declaration of conformity to the PPE Directive. Member States must take all appropriate measures to ensure that, for equipment covered by the PPE Directive, only those items that bear the CE marking are placed on the market and brought into service.</p>
<p>A number of sporting competitions are governed by strict requirements covering the equipment which may be employed. These requirements may be dictated in the interests of safety, or in order to ensure that differences in equipment do not have undue influence on the outcome of competitions. Sporting organisations may accordingly impose such requirements without necessarily infringing competition law.</p>
<p>The information at the Commission’s disposal is not, however, sufficient for it to intervene in the instance to which the honourable Member refers.

<p>Toys and disposable items containing mercury button-cell batteries are becoming increasingly common. According to Sweden's National Environmental Protection Agency, about 50% of these batteries (equivalent to 50 kg of mercury per annum) may end up in household refuse and the mercury may be discharged into the environment via refuse incineration plants and refuse tips. Pursuant to an EC directive, button-cell batteries may contain up to 2% of mercury by weight, despite the fact that there are alternatives to mercury, such as lithium. Lithium batteries cost rather more, however, so that businesses often choose cheaper mercury batteries.</p>

<p>Directive 91/157/EEC on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances was adapted to technical progress by Commission Directive 98/101/EC, which established the prohibition of batteries containing mercury as from 1 January 2000. Only button cells may contain up to 2% mercury. However, it will take some time until batteries containing mercury and also mercury-oxide button cells, which contain 40 to 44% mercury, no longer appear in the waste stream.</p>
<p>Separate collection and appropriate management, as required by Directive 91/157/EEC, is the best way to deal with spent mercury batteries. According to the directive, Member States shall inform the consumer about the danger of uncontrolled disposal (Article 8). In addition, they shall ensure efficient organisation of separate collection and may set up deposit systems (Article 7).</p>
<p>As regards prevention, Member States shall, according to Article 6 draw up programmes with the objectives of reducing the heavy metal content and of promoting the marketing of batteries containing smaller quantities of dangerous and/or polluting substances. If Member States intend to introduce stricter rules as regards the mercury content of batteries, such rules need to be notified according to Article 95 (ex Article 100 A) (4) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The planned revision of Directive 91/157/EEC and the proposed directive on electrical and electronic waste will contribute to improved collection via the collection of all batteries and the collection of equipment containing batteries.

Over a year after the earthquakes, the majority of these buildings are still in the same state, their inhabitants are still living in camps, children are still going to makeshift schools and there are entire regions in which economic life has not yet regained its usual rhythm.</p>
<p>Has the Commission earmarked appropriations to assist earthquake victims, and if so, what are these sums? Has the EIB made a loan, and if so, for what amount? Does the Commission know what proportion of these sums has been paid out, and for which projects, and what other measures does it intend to take in favour of speedy assistance to earthquake victims, reconstruction of their homes and resumption of their professional activities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Immediately following the earthquake which struck Attica in September 1999, the Commission received a request from the Greek authorities for financial aid from the Community in order to deal with the difficult situation caused by this event. On 15 October 1999, the Commissioners responsible for regional policy and for employment and social affairs visited Athens in order to take stock of the damage and to discuss solutions with the Greek Government.</p>
<p>The Commission looked into the possibilities which existed in accordance with the regulations for eligibility for expenses laid down in the structural fund regulation, and came to an agreement with the Greek authorities for the reassignment of a sum of EUR 44.4 million from the European Social Fund (ESF) from the Community support framework 1994-1999, for measures and action to assist the earthquake victims. These measures and actions were part of the operational programmes for combating social exclusion (EUR 19.2 million), lifelong training and the promotion of employment (EUR 7.2 million), industry (EUR 6.75 million), Attica (EUR 2.25 million) and health and welfare (EUR 9 million).</p>
<p>As regards the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Greek authorities requested cofinancing up to an amount of EUR 370 million under the Community support framework 2000-2006 for Greece and within the operational programme for the Attica region. The request covered projects to restore basic infrastructure as well as the educational, health, culture and production infrastructure affected by the earthquake. The above-mentioned operational programme is currently under negotiation and should be adopted at the beginning of the year 2001. It should also be pointed out that the expenditure available under this programme is eligible as of 1 January 2000.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Structural Funds regulations do not permit cofinancing of residences, the Greek authorities approached the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a loan to enable them in turn to cofinance loans for the reconstruction of residences affected by the earthquake. On 10 December 1999, the EIB therefore granted Greece a loan of EUR 300 million, and of this EUR 150 million have already been paid out. The loan is to be administered by the Greek Ministry for the Economy, which is the only body currently in a position to provide more detailed information regarding the ultimate beneficiaries. The EIB is currently awaiting information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in November 2000, the Commission proposed to the Council that Greece be granted a loan of EUR 2 million in order to relieve the burden of interest payments on the EIB loans for the reconstruction of the region destroyed by the earthquake in September 1999. In the same proposal for a Council decision, the Commission also requested that it might be authorised to use future increases in the relevant budget line with a view to supporting measures in order to relieve the burden of interest payments on the loans granted by the EIB for reconstruction of the Attica region following the earthquake in September 1999. The Ecofin Council approved this proposal for a decision from the Commission at its meeting of 27 November 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0940"></a>

<p>A deficit in commitment appropriations remains from the last structural funds programming period which has caused the Commission to make an incorrect assessment of the requirement for appropriations. According to the Commission proposal, this deficit will be covered out of the commitment appropriations earmarked for innovative measures for the current programming period. The proposal is hard to understand, and contains a confusion between the funds intended for different purposes in the two programming periods.</p>
<p>In the Agenda 2000 review, appropriations for innovative measures were cut in favour of the Urban programme. The European Parliament considered in its resolution of 7 July 2000 that the resources allocated for innovative measures should be maintained at the level of the decisions made at Berlin. This was also enshrined in the declaration and Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure. According to the declaration contained in the agreement, the reduction in the appropriations for innovative measures should be compensated for by releasing EUR 200 m from the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p>How can it be possible that innovative measures are losing money as a result of delays by the Commission? What can be done to ensure that the innovative measures receive the money they have been allocated, as agreed at Berlin? What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that similar problems do not arise in future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This issue was raised at the time when transfer 40/2000 was adopted. This transfer was intended to supply commitment appropriations of up to EUR 160 million to the lines for the completion of the Structural Fund projects scheduled for the previous period. The appropriation available within the 2000 budget were to be used for lines earmarked for, on the one hand, for technical assistance and innovative measures (EUR 104 million) and, on the other hand, for Community initiatives (EUR 56 million).</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for regional policy has already had occasion to write a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets (COBU) explaining the reasons for this transfer. In particular, the aim was to fulfil the legal commitments entered into under the Edinburgh agreements which it was not possible to pay for in full out of the budgetary framework applicable en 1994-1999 since the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement did not provide for any adjustment of the financial perspectives in the event of underimplementation of the budget in the years 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that the amounts withdrawn as part of the above-mentioned transfer are valid in legal terms and neutral in budgetary terms. More specifically, with regard to innovative measures, it should be pointed out that the appropriations earmarked for innovative measures are not covered by multiannual programming or a priori distribution between Member States. As a result, any appropriations which were not used in 2000 would be rescinded, with the risk that they would be lost permanently.</p>
<p>Thus, transfer 40/2000 made it possible to fund the commitments left over from the previous programming period by using the available appropriations intended for technical assistance and innovative measures. The underimplementation of appropriations for innovative measures in 2000 is a result of the need to consider the content of these projects, to modernise their management and to programme their implementation in close collaboration with the Parliament and the other institutions and committees concerned. It was not possible to complete this process of consideration, planning and consultation within time limits that were compatible with committing the appropriations for 2000, even though such activities will serve to guarantee the efficiency and proper administration of these projects throughout the rest of the programming period.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern to implement innovative measures within the limits of the total budgetary appropriation decided in Agenda 2000. To this end, the Commission has presented guidelines to Parliament for the implementation of innovative measures under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the period 2000-2006. The total budget appropriation allocated to them for this period is estimated at EUR 400 million.</p>
<p>This amount may be increased if this is possible in terms of the requirements for Community action, resources available, budgetary conditions and implementation capability. In this context, the Commission will carefully examine the possibility of using the flexibility instrument provided for in Paragraph 24 de Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, in accordance with Declaration No 5 appended to this agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0941"></a>

<p>The Commission has for a long time now been contributing to research into the potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. Under the third and fourth framework programmes for R &amp; D, it financed a number of projects aimed at determining the effects of electromagnetic radiation (radio frequencies) on health. The first was a COST action (COST 244, 1992; COST 244a, 1998) concerning the biomedical effects of electromagnetic radiation. This action brought together experts from 17 countries and resulted in substantial contributions (as regards research and standardisation) in Europe and beyond (e.g. in the WHO). The latest projects have recently been concluded, and their results will be given wide dissemination. A follow-up is being prepared. Two studies on the links between electromagnetic radiation and cancer have also been financed under the BIOMED 2 programme.</p>
<p>Under the Measurements and Testing Programme, a project was financed for measuring electromagnetic radiation from mobile telephones and masts and quantifying human exposure to radiation. The results of this project will facilitate the establishment of acceptability standards for appliances, and will also contribute to determining the degree of comparability of the results of the various research efforts now under way into risk assessment.</p>
<p>The total budget devoted by the Community to these studies was approximately EUR 2 million. None of the studies (which included the thermal effects of energy absorption and possible disturbances of metabolism from the various types of electromagnetic field) has pointed to adverse effects on health; nonetheless, additional results are needed if public concern is to be allayed in full.</p>
<p>The subject of electromagnetic radiation has therefore been specifically included in the fifth framework programme, within the working programme of key action 4 (environment and health) of strand 1 (quality of life and management of living resources). Following the 1999 call for proposals, five proposals were accepted involving total funding of approximately EUR 9 million. These projects, essentially concerning the potential carcinogenic effects of radio frequencies, got off the ground in early 2000 and are expected to bear fruit in three or four years' time.</p>
<p>These projects include a large-scale epidemiological study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the International Centre for Cancer Research and aimed at determining whether electromagnetic radiation from mobile telephones can cause cancer. The other projects are aimed at improving understanding of the biological mechanisms by which electromagnetic radiation can influence human health (and, in particular, cause cancer): the means employed include using test batteries in both experiments on live mice and rats and in an in-vitro context (new molecular biology techniques).</p>
<p>The studies under way, which are targeted primarily at potential carcinogenic effects, will be supplemented by the 2001 call for proposals under the key action for the environment and health. This will be specifically targeted at quantifying exposure to electromagnetic radiation and at other potential effects on health. It will make it possible to obtain scientific data which can be directly used for improving risk assessment.</p>

<p>The Commission is nonetheless continuously following the results of the latest scientific studies, as well as the opinions of its Scientific Steering Committee, to ensure that it can, at any moment, take the legislative action required to guarantee continued high standards of health protection for the citizens of the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
