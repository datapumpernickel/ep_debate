<p class="contents">I would like to start by congratulating Mr von Wogau and thanking him for all his impressive efforts to build consensus on this important matter in this House. Let me also congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath, who chairs the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and who has helped to stimulate the Commission’s thinking on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing the proposals contained in the Lamfalussy report in a fair and balanced way is of major importance to the European Union. It lays down essential stages for delivering the entire Financial Services Action Plan by 2005, as requested by the Lisbon European Council, and the measures relating to the securities markets by 2003, as requested by the Stockholm European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is, of course, to build a strong, stable, pan-European capital market, a market which will benefit its citizens and businesses by improving future employment and growth prospects throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached a fair and honourable compromise. Let us, together, seize the moment. I am confident that our debate today will yield a positive result and send out a strong signal of the renewed and effective cooperation between Commission, Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Before making a formal statement on behalf of the Commission, I should first like to dispel any possible doubts by stating that the Commission will act both on this statement and on the Stockholm European Council resolution and what is set out in the letter of 2 October 2001 from Commissioner Bolkestein to Mrs Randzio-Plath, Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to three vitally important points. Firstly, the Commission will naturally respect Parliament’s powers of codecision and the rights to information and transparency which underpin our democratic process. The Commission will do business with Parliament and the Council on a joint basis, fully respecting the current interinstitutional balance. Secondly, the Commission will, without exception, take full account of the European Parliament’s position, as is provided for in the Stockholm European Council resolution. It will do everything in its power to find appropriate solutions in keeping with the current interinstitutional balance. Thirdly, with a view to the longer term and the revision of the Treaties, the Commission wishes to see Article 202 amended and both its own future executive duties and the joint role of the two co-legislators clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">This concludes my preliminary remarks. I shall now make a formal statement on behalf of the European Commission:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">“As was recalled at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, the integration of financial services markets is fundamental to strengthening the European economy.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">The delivery of the Financial Services Action Plan by the deadlines set by the European Council conclusions – 2005 for the entire Action Plan and 2003 for the measures relating to securities markets – is crucial to achieving this objective.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which will take stock of the European Union’s economic reform process as mapped out in Lisbon, the Commission welcomes the close cooperation between the Community institutions and expresses confidence in its harmonious development when it comes to implementing the Commission’s proposals, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Wise Men chaired by Baron Lamfalussy.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">The Commission stated in its White Paper on European Governance that, in general, its executive responsibilities need to be more clearly defined and that the Council and the European Parliament should have an equal role in controlling the way in which the Commission carries out its executive role. In the White Paper, it also announced its intention of launching a debate on this issue in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and indicated that it favours an amendment to Article 202 of the EC Treaty.</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">In the meantime, before the next revision of the Treaty and without setting a precedent, flexible regulatory mechanisms in the field of financial services are needed that fully respect the institutional balance. In this regard, a letter was sent on 2 October 2001 by the responsible Commissioner to the chair of Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In this context, the Commission is now in a position:</span></p>
<p class="contents">- <span class="italic">to take note of Parliament’s intention to limit the duration of the delegation of executive powers to the Commission to four years from the entry into force of each particular directive, subject to an extension being proposed by the Commission and accepted by Parliament and the Council. The Commission could accept amendments adopted by Parliament to this end;</span></p>
<p class="contents">- <span class="italic">to ensure that Parliament is given a period of three months from the first transmission of draft implementing measures in which to examine them and to give its opinion. However, in urgent cases that are duly substantiated, this period may be shortened;</span></p>
<p class="contents">- <span class="italic">to ensure full transparency vis-à-vis Parliament throughout the entire procedure for the adoption of implementing measures. The Commission will also ensure that there is wide public consultation before draft implementing measures are drawn up;</span></p>
<p class="contents">- <span class="italic">to support Parliament’s wish to see the establishment of a market participants group attached to the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and it strongly encourages its establishment in as short a time as possible;</span></p>
<p class="contents">- <span class="italic">to recall its political willingness to endeavour to ensure that Parliament benefits from equivalent treatment and, in order to secure effective cooperation between the institutions, reaffirms its commitment to take the utmost account of Parliament’s position and any resolutions that it might adopt with regard to implementing measures exceeding the implementing powers provided for in the basic instrument and the Commission’s aim of reaching a balanced solution in such cases.”</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will firmly support the approach that I have outlined. It is the fruit of a lengthy debate and very close cooperation between Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, with this approach, we can now take another major step forward towards European financial integration, which is the next crucial step after the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s positive result makes it even more essential for work to start in the interinstitutional working party to which Prime Minister Aznar, no less, pledged his authoritative support before this House during the January part-session.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Wogau (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an extraordinarily important debate that we are taking part in today. It is important to banks, insurance companies and investment funds, because this debate will make it clear that we are pressing onward – and that without delay – on the road that leads to a common European market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is though, also important to the European Union's citizens, as we are removing obstacles from the path of cross-border competition in the field of financial services, in the granting of credits and the negotiation of insurance policies. Competition of this sort will put the citizen in a stronger position and enhance Europe's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is this debate about? Alexandre Lamfalussy and his Committee of Wise Men have made proposals as to how we can speed up the great legislative package needed to make this common market in financial services a reality. In doing so, he made the wise suggestion that the legislator, that is Parliament and the Council, should focus on setting the essential objectives, whilst leaving to the Commission, working together with experts, the small print of the implementation provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">That proposal is a very good one. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that we have always found, in our experience as parliamentarians, that it is to us that the public and firms come with complaints about the European Union's bureaucracy, and that they are not complaining about the law, be it a directive or a regulation, that we have helped to enact, but about the provisions made for its implementation. That is why Parliament has insisted on being able, jointly with the Council, to carry out a kind of final check on whether the implementation provisions that are enacted actually correspond to what the legislator intended.</p>
<p class="contents">What have our negotiations with the Commission and the Council now achieved? At this point, let me warmly thank President Prodi for his statement, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, Mr John Mogg and many others, as well as the secretariat of the Constitutional Committee. I have to tell you that the discussions lawyers had in this area occasionally reminded me of disputations in ancient Byzantium on the sex of angels. I wish to thank very warmly all those who helped me find my way judiciously through this labyrinth.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we achieved? Transparency first of all. That is important, as we are informed about everything that goes on in the Commission. We also get to see preliminary drafts. Secondly, we have achieved the reduction of the mandate to four years, after which period it must be renewed by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, furthermore, gained the right to monitor outcomes, which is where President Prodi's statement was extraordinarily important. Like the Council, we have three months in which to do this, in which respect we are given equivalence with them. President Prodi, indeed, spoke of parity and equivalence, which adds up to an additional safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must be clear in our own minds about the actual relations between the powers. We are faced with a large number of legislative acts, which have to be adopted. Each time, Parliament and the Council together must give the Commission a mandate, and if the Commission were to fail to take Parliament's justified interests and objections into account in this respect, it would have cause to fear that it would not be granted that mandate when it came to the next legislative act. What this means is that, today in any case, we as a Parliament are in a very strong position in this context. To that extent I take the view that, in this context, or on the basis of President Prodi's statement, the equivalence we demanded has been granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that strikes me as also especially important is the committee of market participants, which we decided on. This represents a first step towards the European Union's lawmaking becoming more modern. We must reach the situation in which legislation generally makes a clear distinction, as Alexandre Lamfalussy proposed, between the Parliament and the Council's intentions as joint legislators and the small print of the technical details. Here, for example, the supervisory authorities and the experts should be involved, but at the same time the market participants, too, should be included in the structures as purely practical issues are under discussion. In that sense I also believe that what we are deciding on today can also be a model for the Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference, and the improvement of the European Union's legislative procedure, and so I wish to ask you to adopt my report.</p>

<p class="contents">This statement is peppered with ‘constructive’ ambiguities, and I hope that, on this basis, we will manage to complete the fruitful discussion that we started in this House, following the resolutions that Parliament adopted on 13 March and 5 April 2001, and the publication of the Lamfalussy report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make on the important nature of the discussion that we are holding today. My first comment is that, as the rapporteur pointed out, following the introduction of the euro, it is crucially important that we put in place an action plan on financial services, especially if we want to reach the objectives that we set collectively at Lisbon, namely to make the European Union the most competitive economic area in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the institutional issues are also important and provide the evidence of democracy. From this perspective, the discussion that we are holding today is of major importance when you take a look at the timetable before us: the Convention and the IGC, the Commission’s White Paper on Governance, the essential reform of Article 202 of the Treaty and the redrafting of the interinstitutional agreement on comitology, which patently does not take account of the evolving powers and role of the European Parliament as a legislator, in particular, in the economic and monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, from the Commission’s point of view, the fact that the two pillars of economic and monetary Union are working well means that the European Parliament is a full partner and this demonstrates the importance of the discussion that we have been holding with you for almost a year now.</p>
<p class="contents">We will all appreciate the outcome of this discussion, from our own perspective, both in economic and institutional terms. Personally speaking, I would like to underline two points, the first on the issues that you brought up in your statement and the second on what will certainly be the subject of future discussions that we will hold, particularly within the framework of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first point, I think you mentioned the notorious ‘constructive’ ambiguity of doing business on an equivalent basis. We do not believe that equal treatment is a matter of discussing complex subtleties: it is in the hands of the Council. You are aware of this, Mr Prodi. In any case, this is how we are interpreting your statement and comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Behind this, however, there is the idea that this request, in addition to the formal statement that you have just made, must be used as a reference each time that we have to issue an opinion on a document within the framework of the financial services action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, also, there is the issue that you have not tackled today and that we will continue to bring up in the forthcoming meetings that we shall have with you, namely, how can we avoid a possible disagreement between the European Parliament and Commission? On this point, we believe that the idea of an informal trilogue enabling us to reach a balanced and mutually acceptable agreement, as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is the correct negotiating basis for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would seem that these demands being made with regard to financial services are quite justified. This means we really have to evolve a modern legislative process, as Mr von Wogau mentioned. Unfortunately, a modern legislative process often seems to mean that it is the European Parliament that is expected to give up some of the legislative powers it enjoys by virtue of the Treaty. The problem with the Lamfalussy package is that the European Parliament cannot be completely certain it would not, in fact, be surrendering the legislative power it has on behalf of the citizens of the EU to the Council, on the one hand, and the Commission, on the other. In this regard, the European Parliament must ensure that these parliamentary supervisory powers are brought into closer focus.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of this institution, you will surely seize on the proposal that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has put forward: whenever the European Parliament suspects that the Commission is using more than its fair share of powers of implementation, you could negotiate an <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>scrutiny mechanism to prevent Parliament’s legislative powers from being watered down. We all know that Parliament’s legislative power is not an end in itself: we really try to ensure, on behalf of the public, that decisions are taken openly and democratically, and that all views worthy of attention are taken into consideration during the process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also perfectly clear that the EC Treaty is no longer relevant to modern times in this respect. The Commission’s commitment to amending Article 202 of the Treaty in the very near future, which would restore Parliament’s legislative and supervisory powers, is to be welcomed with open arms. It should also be emphasised that the European Union needs a hierarchy of legal acts, with legislative powers and powers of implementation being defined very clearly. At present we are in a grey area with this Lamfalussy package, the direct result of level 2 decision-making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this debate is probably not going to be treated as a priority interest by the media. Nevertheless, and I am addressing the public who are in the galleries, this is a very important debate for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that today, after many months of work, negotiation and seeking a consensus, this Parliament will take a decision on the report which has been admirably well drawn up by Karl von Wogau, and which represents one more step forward in the process of constructing an economic and monetary Europe, and furthermore, is an important step within the framework of the process started at the Lisbon European Council aimed at achieving greater flexibility, competitiveness and growth and creating jobs. I also hope that this process will include other important decisions at the next European Council in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">At a point when the euro and its implementation have been a great success, this Parliament, the Commission and the Council must demonstrate that they are fulfilling the obligations laid down for them in the Treaties. Mr President of the Commission, you have done this recently – and I thank you for being here today – by adopting the appropriate measures and reproaching those countries which are on the point of exceeding the criteria established in Maastricht in the field of deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good decision, and I am therefore deeply disappointed that the German Commissioner has shown a lack of solidarity in certain comments made in <span class="italic">Bild am Sonntag</span>. I do not approve of this, because what we want is to maintain the internal cohesion of the European institutions and the balance between all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, this exercise is politically positive, because Parliament has had to fight hard to gain its competences, like all parliaments. Therefore, having gained them, we want to keep them, since that is what the people demand. Baron Lamfalussy’ proposals, which we all agree are needed, also mean, in the long run, putting our trust in the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I would like to tell you that we have always defended the European Commission, because it is at the heart of the Community institutions and is the most obvious motor for integration. However, as Mrs Berès and Mrs Hautala have quite rightly said, we must take precautions. We neither can nor want to give anybody a blank cheque. That is why this negotiation has gone on so long and has involved so many people. And I would like to acknowledge, not only the rapporteur, whose work we have all praised, but also Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Napolitano, the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Bolkestein and his team, as well as Mr Rato.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have finally achieved a text, whose declaration you have read today and which, in the judgment of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, fully satisfies – and I say this emphatically – our expectations: we are going to be treated on an equal basis with the Council, our rights of codecision and the transparency requirements we demanded are going to be guaranteed and there is a formal commitment from the European Commission that, in the next reform of the Treaties, which the Convention is going to analyse, there should be a modification of Article 202.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is therefore a good day for European integration: we are sending messages to the markets that we are prepared to make even more progress in realising all the aspects of economic union. It is also good news for the citizens, who, thanks to our choosing this method, are going to see the disappearance of much rigidity, which will give us hope for greater growth and employment in the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, what we are debating is the proposal that Parliament and the Council should delegate substantial implementing powers to the Commission. Parliament is happy to go along with that, provided there are substantial guarantees as regards the oversight of such delegated powers. Those who sometimes worry that in seeking such guarantees Parliament is trying to modify the interinstitutional equilibrium should remember that this substantial delegation of powers is itself a modification of the interinstitutional equilibrium as it exists and that in those circumstances it is quite legitimate for Parliament to seek to obtain certain guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">After many months of discussion, talks and negotiations with the Commission, the result has now been put forward to us in the form of the statement just made by Mr Prodi. I must say that it contains a number of significant steps forward. First, the Commission recognises that Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed at the next revision of the Treaty – it supports Parliament's position on that. But, in the meantime, the Commission recognises that Parliament has the right to examine and take a position on the implementing measures that it puts forward to the specialist committees that will be set up to work with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will have three months instead of just one month, as it has under existing procedures, to examine and take a position on such implementing measures. The text of the Commission does not limit Parliament's right to examining whether the Commission has gone beyond what has been delegated to it, something which we could anyway solve by means of a legal case, if ever it came to a conflict. It gives us the right to object, if need be, on the substance. That is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">But what happens if Parliament objects and then the Commission does not accept its objection to an implementing measure? There the text is a little ambiguous: it speaks of equivalence without saying equivalence with whom. Mrs Berès has already made the point: equivalence with the Economic and Social Committee, equivalence with the press? No, it is obvious for us insiders that it means equivalence with the Council. That is what we have been talking about for months, and Mr Prodi's introductory remarks made it clear that the Commission too accepts that it means equivalence with the Council. That is how we interpret it and I think there can be no other interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a third step forward and that is a guarantee in case all this does not work. We have the sunset clause: after four years the delegated powers will revert to Parliament and the Council, unless we agree to renew them. That is a guarantee to us and it will concentrate the minds of the Commission in between times, making it aware that it must exercise these implementing powers in a way that Parliament finds satisfactory if it wishes to have any hope of their renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have some important guarantees as regards openness and transparency, and we have acceptance of Parliament's idea that a market participants' committee should be set up alongside the other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">So, all in all, we can be satisfied with the progress that has been made, even if the drafting on the points I made earlier could have been a little better. Nonetheless, I would ask whether the full text of the Commission's statement and Mr Prodi's statement today could be incorporated not just in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings but also in the Minutes, because it was a very significant statement and should be recorded in our Minutes, so that we have a proper record of what the Commission has undertaken to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, for more than a year we in Parliament's negotiating teams, together with the Commission and the Council of Ministers, have been struggling with a puzzle. We have all agreed with Baron Lamfalussy and his wise men that effective regulation of financial markets and the creation of a single financial market require us to delegate powers to the Commission and to a more nimble official committee. But there has been a key problem. Although this House was given the power of codecision vis-à-vis such legislation by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it was not given the power to oversee effectively the role of any committee. What we have seen of such committees in the past, we have not liked; they have been secretive, bureaucratic, Kafkaesque. One condition on which my group insisted was that this culture of secrecy must change fundamentally, opening up decision-making not only to us in Parliament, but to the world outside. We needed guarantees of transparency, openness and consultation. Here they are in the President's statement and in the letter that Commissioner Bolkestein addressed to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">But how were we to ensure that those promises of a changed culture, so often honoured in the breach, were finally respected? It became clear that no lasting change could happen before the convention and the intergovernmental conference of 2004 had been concluded. Only an IGC could change Article 202, which basically gives sole rights of oversight of committees to the Council of Ministers, ignoring the new role of Parliament. We needed a promise that our concerns, ignored in successive treaty revisions, would be taken on board. We needed an interim solution that meant that Europe's savers and investors did not have to wait still longer before the completion of the single market in financial services, which was first launched in 1973. The health of the European economy depends on this legislation. A vital and dynamic economy depends on an efficient financial system for collecting savings and funnelling them at low cost to the most productive uses.</p>
<p class="contents">It was long clear to the Liberal Group that the only interim solution would be to put a time limit on the delegated powers. For the first time in EU legislation, we will have a sunset clause that will remove the powers of the Commission and the committee after four years unless they are used wisely and well. Thankfully, the initial opposition of the Socialist Group and the European People's Party, together with concerns about legal uncertainty, were overcome. Any regulations passed by the committee will remain on the statute book even if its powers are suspended, but Parliament can bite if it needs to.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important moment for liberalisation of the European economy. The deal will underpin the euro – for what is a single currency if the markets on which it is traded are still divided by national barriers? It will give confidence that, whatever the challenges ahead for economic and monetary union, the European Union can surmount them, and it shows that Parliament is a serious and responsible legislature and partner in economic reform. The Lisbon reform process is back on track. I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr von Wogau, our rapporteur, and commend this report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is matched by the claim that the committee wants to enhance democratic control over this fast-moving area. What I do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve. Without dwelling on any particular aspect of the financial services legislation to which this report refers, I have to fulfil my own democratic responsibility and point out that the aggregation of Community legislation is slowly, but inexorably, strangling the financial community and making it almost impossible to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I am constantly reminded by my constituents that those most affected are the small and independent financial advisers, the net effect being that business is becoming steadily concentrated in the hands of larger and larger firms. On the other hand, I see no slackening in the number of financial scandals which break into the headlines. In fact, the very reverse seems to be the case. Coming as I do from a tradition where parliament is the guarantor of safeguards and freedoms of individuals, I therefore find this report yet another exercise in increasing the power of the Community institutions, with no thought for what the legislation is trying to achieve. The committee is counting the angels dancing on the end of a pin while the industry gradually collapses. This to me typifies what the Community is about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, Parliament has two distinct aims, which could have been conflicting: on the one hand, the need to secure a more significant, effective role for Parliament in these matters, to secure, that is, greater democratic legitimisation of the rules we are debating; on the other hand, however, there is the urgent need to conclude the Financial Services Action Plan with all speed in order to implement the common market in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seriously behind schedule, and the persistence of this hotchpotch of regulations is creating barriers which are costing the European citizens dearly. One example is the case of pension funds, which have long been constrained by protectionist rules in the different Member States. The average size of European pension funds is one sixth of that of pension funds in the United States and the yield in Europe is 60% of the American figure. This represents a severe handicap for pensioners, for savers in general and for the efficiency of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The time factor is crucial. We are lagging behind severely and we must therefore be responsible in our attitude and not neglect the need to give a vigorous boost to the construction of the internal market in our pursuit of the goal of securing a proper role for our institution.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, my view is that the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, Mrs Berès, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have succeeded in achieving a balance between these requirements, providing us with a good short-term solution and pointing the way for the future. The Italian radicals will therefore vote for the measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Various Members have referred to angels this morning – either to the sex of angels or to how many could dance on the head of a pin. May I say that it is often in the detail that one encounters the devil. Let us hope that the devil and angels will compensate for one another and that we can achieve a balanced compromise this morning. According to some Members who have spoken this morning, Mr Méndez de Vigo for example, that is indeed the case. He said that this is a good day for integration and offered congratulations to the rapporteur – congratulations which I should like to echo on behalf of the Commission. I should like to thank Mr von Wogau and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs very much for having crafted this compromise. It is only right that the Commission should give expression to those feelings.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau started by referring to the ambition of the European Union as expressed by the European Council in Lisbon, which is, as is well known, that the European Union should become the most competitive place in the world. The Lamfalussy report should be seen in that context. Mrs Berès also referred to the ambitions expressed in Lisbon. Indeed they form a whole, and I do not need to emphasise our wish to give as much impetus and stimulus as possible to our moves towards greater competitiveness. Once again, this debate and the result which I hope it produces are of importance to the economic well being of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have to explain what the report of the committee headed by Baron Lamfalussy is about and the way it refers to the comitology procedure for implementing measures or executive proposals. The report by Mr von Wogau enumerated what has been achieved. Mr Corbett has also done so. He referred to the fact that, in the Commission's opinion, Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed in the context of the next intergovernmental conference – and this is the heart of the matter. Parliament has often impressed upon myself and others the need to achieve equality with the Council in the oversight granted to both Parliament and the Council in considering executive proposals. The Commission agrees and also sees the need for equal standing for Parliament vis-à-vis the Council in the whole comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, from the point of view of Parliament – and the Commission recognises its feelings and opinions – this is not possible at the moment. Article 202 is clear: the comitology procedure arrived at in June 1999 is also clear and, as much as the Commission sees the point of view of Parliament and has said so in its own White Paper on governance, it is at present unable to grant Parliament's wishes. The Commission's view as laid down in the White Paper on governance is that Article 202 ought to be changed. However, the Commission itself cannot do that; any such change has to take place in connection with the next intergovernmental conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett mentioned that Parliament now has three months to consider the executive measures put forward by the Commission. There is full equality with the Council here, and that is a good thing. He went on to say that Parliament now has the possibility to object in substance. Yes, indeed, the substance concerns us all and Parliament has the inherent right to put forward its positions and its arguments. The Commission has said that it will take the fullest possible account of Parliament's position. That is also what Parliament would want the Commission to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett spoke about equivalence – a fine word – but equivalence with whom? Obviously, equivalence with the Council. That is what the whole debate is about and it would not do to deny what is clear to every one. Parliament wants that equivalence with the Council; the Commission is willing to grant it, takes the same view, and has said so in its declaration and in discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett mentioned a sunset clause, which is another example of a weapon available to Parliament to ensure that the Commission takes the utmost account of Parliament's wishes. The sunset clause means that the delegation of executive measures to the Commission lasts for no longer than four years. It may be prolonged on the initiative of the Commission, but it certainly keeps the Commission's nose to the grindstone and is a powerful weapon available to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to another factor, mentioned by Mr von Wogau. In his introductory statement Mr von Wogau said that if the Commission does not carry out its promises – as set out in the declaration made by Mr Prodi – then the next time a directive comes around Parliament knows that it can keep a tight rein on the Commission. The Commission is well aware of that. That is another way in which Parliament can put forward its opinion forcefully and with conviction. The Commission would therefore be well advised to listen carefully and take the utmost account of that opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett's last remark – apart from the desire to have the declaration put into the Minutes – was on openness and transparency. The Commission has stated this morning and in the letter I sent on 2 October to Mrs Randzio-Plath, chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that it is most willing to practise that openness and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titford said that the industry would collapse. Methinks this is a poetic exaggeration. I am not under the impression that the industry is about to collapse. Yes, scandals emerge – perhaps less so in the European Union than in other parts of the world – but that is a fact of life. I do not think the proposals made by Mr Prodi this morning will fuel more scandals. They will, in fact, go a long way towards avoiding them, and therefore I cannot agree with the sentiments expressed by Mr Titford.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come back to Mr Méndez de Vigo who said that it was a good day for integration. He congratulated Mr von Wogau, and I join him in that. I wish to congratulate Mr von Wogau personally on the fact that at 11 o'clock this morning he will receive a high French decoration, the <span class="italic">Légion d'Honneur</span>. The Commission congratulates him.</p>

Parliament has secured significant concessions on transparency, on consultation and on oversight. Parliament's rapporteur is to be congratulated for securing those. Parliament should also express its appreciation to Mr Bolkestein and his staff, and to the Commission, for responding to the concerns that we raised about these matters. Mr von Wogau deserves much praise for drawing to a conclusion the lengthy negotiations that we have had on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament have taken a pragmatic approach. This is a workable interim solution pending final resolution of the whole matter of delegated legislation in 2004, when Parliament could and should ask for a legally binding call-back mechanism, which is desirable but, sadly, not permissible within the terms of the current Treaty and arrangements. It is of vital importance that Parliament backs this compromise when it votes at 12 noon today, because without it we will not be in a position to deliver an integrated financial market – whether in 2004, 2005 or indeed ever. That financial market is not just of interest to bankers; it could also lead to cheaper prices and a wider choice of financial products for consumers and businesses, cheaper borrowing, higher returns for savers and investors, as well as doing a great deal to start defusing the pensions time bomb. All these are highly significant benefits to the ordinary people who elected us to serve on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">Accepting this compromise will bring us considerably closer to achieving our goal of an integrated financial market and delivering those benefits to ordinary people right across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know how important it is that we catch up on the United States' integrated market in terms of the productivity of capital. On the other hand, we are also aware that the European financial market has significance not only for enterprises but also for those who rely on proper provision for old age, in other words who are, as consumers, dependent on it in view of their small pensions. Parliament therefore bears a heavy responsibility for coming to the right decisions in the co-decision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's proceedings, with our debate on the von Wogau report, we have an extremely sensitive topic to deal with. The rapporteur has attempted to find cautious formulations in order to give a chance to all the parties who are particularly sensitive to the effects of this legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to underline again that Parliament, which demands more and more rights of co-decision, will not refrain from doing so in the parliamentary legislative procedure and that today's compromise in the von Wogau report is without prejudice to the possibility of Parliament giving up this legal position.</p>
<p class="contents">If we come to a transitional arrangement for secondary legislation today, that will only mean that we as a Parliament had previously been unable to push through the cementing of secondary legislation in the Treaty. That had previously been a matter for the Commission. In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to Mr Bolkestein for the fact that our negotiations on governance, laborious and difficult though they were, nonetheless succeeded in getting this formulation incorporated into the White Paper as a Commission proposal. That is a success in which we all share. Now we also have to achieve a successful conclusion to the next Intergovernmental Conference and the next amendment of the Treaties. That is, without a doubt, very important.</p>
<p class="contents">One question, though, has not been answered – that of to what extent we can actually attribute real significance to the Lamfalussy procedure in all this legislation, because all of what has been described as technical, today, is very often political. Parliament cannot be satisfied with a role legislating only in outline; we must rather still hold on to our authority to define, item by item, detail by detail, paragraph by paragraph, and article by article. We shall pay attention to that. I think it should also be clear, Mr Prodi, following your statement and also Mr Bolkestein's, that we will also take care to ensure that Mr Bolkestein's letter of 2 October to the committee will also, as an interpretation, be part of this protocol. The third thing that is clear is that, by its two statements, the Commission is committing itself, today, in the implementation of the Lamfalussy procedure, not, under any circumstances, to follow the recommendations of the Securities Committee against a qualified majority. This was, fortunately, clear today. So I think we can be full of optimism and constructive spirit in approaching this form of cooperation on the basis of parity and equivalence.</p>

It is an issue which has been waiting to be solved for a very long time, and I wish to be the first to welcome a solution. Our debate today shows the general dilemma we face between, on the one hand, wishing to be effective and, on the other hand, wishing to secure democratic control by means of the legislation we adopt, and it is this issue of, on the one hand, effectiveness, and, on the other hand, democratic control which is to be discussed in detail during the forthcoming Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who want to see clear ground rules for the European institutions are often criticised for being nit picking and preoccupied with power. I disagree very strongly with that view. In my country, Denmark, we had a constitutional struggle that lasted from 1866 right up to 1901, in which parliamentarianism was finally adopted as the central democratic principle. It is the same process we are now in the throes of at European level. I am therefore also very pleased that, in the midst of this struggle, we in the EU are able to deliver a result, namely this practical agreement. To refer again to the situation in Denmark 130 years ago, the whole political system was just about paralysed during the Danish constitutional struggle. I am therefore very pleased about the President of the Commission’s, Mr Prodi’s, statement that the Commission approves the content of this report, which ought to receive considerable support from the European Parliament. However, it is extremely important that the Council not merely accept the content, but also the basic message, of this report. Quite a few Members of the Council basically believe that this whole matter is futile and is merely a case of Parliament’s making a nuisance of itself. That is not so. It is, in short, about exercising democratic control by means of our common European legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, at this point in the debate the facts have been well established. The history of the tempestuous relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been well described and if, as Lenin said, only fools discuss the facts, I do not want to fall into that temptation and I will say no more on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if you will allow me to speak autobiographically, I belong to the generation of Spaniards who well recognise the importance of parliament in a democracy. What is more, I was part of the Spanish Parliament that created the Constitution. I therefore have great sympathy for Mrs Randzio-Plath’s defence of the rights of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, to continue in an autobiographical vein, I am also a committed European and I am absolutely sure that, just as the euro was essential yesterday, today structural reforms are absolutely necessary and, amongst them, we must place special emphasis on the reform of financial services if we want the European economy to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point is the reconciliation of these two objectives: doing things well and doing them quickly, speeding up the process and respecting the rights of Parliament, must be carried out, as Mr Huhne said, within strict limits, the limits laid down in Article 202, which are badly worded and whose reform we advocate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the solution to this dilemma has been discovered by the new Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour, Karl von Wogau, and supported by this Parliament. I hope that the Commission appreciates this vote of confidence from Parliament in the Commission and the Council, and that it will never fall into the temptation – since Mr Bolkestein likes Latin – to alter the <span class="italic">par conditio</span>, because the reaction of a spurned lover is unpredictable. Parliament has the powers to try to go into the maximum detail within level 1, which would delay the process. Parliament could, like a spurned lover, delay discussing the proposals and that would mean doing the opposite to what we should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today is a great day for all of us. I congratulate Karl von Wogau, the Commission and the Council and I hope that in Barcelona we will be able to reap the harvest which we have begun to sow today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is indeed a most decisive day as far as the role of Parliament is concerned. President Prodi's statement – which I see as an undertaking by the Commission – has made clear in an unprecedented way that the Commission will put its weight behind the idea that the two components of the legislature should have real equality of rights in what they do. I believe that what Commissioner Bolkestein had to say was also of particular value. It was, in particular, thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath's initiative and endeavours that we were able to convince Commissioner Bolkestein as well, something that was not so easy, nor was it clear from the outset that we would be able to do it. I do not believe that Commissioner Bolkestein has now been transformed from a devil into an angel, for we did not see him as a devil and he is not an angel now, but a good piece of work has been done. Commissioner Bolkestein, I would also like to express my respect for the way you today clarified and enlarged on what President Prodi said.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I see this as a clear commitment by the Commission to bring about the parity, as President Prodi stated, of the two components of the legislature, to give equal weight and value to the roles of the two legislative bodies, the Council and Parliament, and finally, to do so by means of the amendment to Article 202. The statement is clear and unequivocal, and it is as such that we will always, to some extent, keep it in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, secondly, definite statements on how this equal treatment will affect financial services. I assume that other areas are also affected by the intention – even subject to the legal position as depicted by Mr Bolkestein – to do everything legally permissible to achieve <span class="italic">de facto</span> equal treatment for the two components of the legislature. I must acknowledge that what you say, Mr Bolkestein, is indeed how the law stands. What I can read between the lines, though, is that the legal position will not be used to keep the unequal treatment in place until Article 202 is amended, but that everything possible is to be done in the meantime to achieve <span class="italic">de facto</span> equal treatment of the two legislative bodies in all essential matters.</p>
<p class="contents">For my third point, Mr President, I will address you, for it has to do with the setting up of an interinstitutional working party to make appropriate preparations, something which President Prodi has repeatedly urged, most recently persuading Mr Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council, to give a positive response to the effect that this working party is now actually going to be convened. I would think it right and proper, Mr President, if joint discussions in the Conference of Presidents were to prompt you also to take the initiative in order to achieve what, as I have said, President Prodi was the first to propose, namely this interinstitutional working party. Today is an important day in the sense that it is now a matter of record that we recognise the knowledge and insight possessed by the experts, but at the same time that democratic control means that it is parliaments that, at the end of the day, decide on political objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report and the statements made about it by both the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Commissioner Bolkestein, free up a process which has really prevented the speed that we would have liked in the negotiation of projects and the proposals for the creation of an internal market in the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the little time remaining for me, I would like to focus on two aspects. Firstly, once we have freed up the process by means of the agreement that today’s debate represents, what we have to do is get to work. That is to say, we have to make the 42 directives envisaged a reality, by 2003 in the case of the capital market and by 2005 in the case of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that the European Parliament has never created obstacles when it has been asked for speed, urgency and cooperation in the implementation of projects and issues of such importance as the implementation of the euro or the European internal market itself, which are two very important successes of European construction. The Commission has not normally created obstacles, nor has Parliament, and if we have ever been faced with obstacles, it has been in the Council. In other words, everybody must fulfil their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for this report and for his gesture of commitment to various committees and institutions, in order to resume progress towards realisation of a common objective. This instance has provided an answer to the question as to what sex an angel is; here the parliamentary angel was a male one in the person of Karl von Wogau.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to thank him, again, today for the excellent work he has done for the Community on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which he has left after many decades and to which – as to all the other committees he sits on, as this report shows – he has brought massive experience and economic knowledge. Thank you, Karl.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point – and this is probably beyond doubt – is that we must speed up the Lisbon process, and – not only for that reason, but certainly for that reason – we must create an internal market for securities as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that whoever wants to do that must take all necessary steps to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making procedure and accelerate the legislative process. That, after all, is the reason for this report and for the Lamfalussy report too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one contradiction I wish to clear up. There is no contradiction between speeding up the procedure and Parliament having greater efficiency and more codecision. There is a contradiction between Article 202 and Parliament's codecision procedure; that is why it needs to be amended. So I do not only expect codecision, information and transparency to be adhered to, as this is so formulated in most of the translations of the Commission's reports; rather, I expect us to make every effort to help bring to fruition something that is a fundamental Parliamentary right and a precondition for transparency and information. This report is an important step towards making this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to direct your attention to item 5 of the report – I do not need to explain it at the moment – and to two events that show why we are so sceptical. I recall that the Commission presented a report in October 2000 on occupational pension schemes, which Parliament adopted in July by 460 votes, yet the Council has not, to date, adopted a Common Position on it. I recall the European Company, on which we are in agreement on matters of content but not at all as regards form, because we act on the basis of Article 95 and, in Nice, the Council pulled the legal basis for codecision from under our feet. That is why we are so sceptical.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my last point. Mr President of the Commission, I wish to refer in this context to the sentence in your statement in which you said that it is the introduction of the euro that makes this report so important, and that, by this report, we are contributing to a strong and solid capital market. I therefore do not at all understand how a member of your Commission can, in a German newspaper, criticise your decision to send a notice of poor performance to the Federal Republic of Germany and actually dissociate himself from the thinking behind it. I would like a statement on that as well, as the Stability Pact and adherence to it are issues affecting the credibility of the euro and a precondition for public confidence in it. I consider the letter necessary because we must not differentiate between States, but must do our utmost to ensure that the Stability Pact is applied to everyone equally and with its full weight. Anyone who dissociates himself from that is endangering the credibility of the Stability Pact and, thereby, confidence in the euro.</p>

Nevertheless, Mr Prodi’s answer is not totally satisfactory, because Mr Prodi was still vague on the crucial point, namely that of equal rights between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi tells us that the Commission is declaring its political will to work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment. Equal with whom and equal to what? Commissioner Bolkestein told us that we must not discuss the sex of angels, but that ‘equivalence’ obviously means equivalence between Parliament and the Council. At the same time, however, Mr Bolkestein is warning us that the Commission cannot guarantee us this equivalence. Why did Mr Prodi not use these simple words, namely ‘equal treatment with the Council’?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am the European Parliament’s rapporteur on the market abuse directive. I must now table an amendment, therefore, laying down in substance that the Commission will be permitted to make technical amendments to this directive and that Parliament will have three months in which to respond. If, within this time, Parliament has not adopted a resolution stating that the proposed technical amendments go beyond the executing powers specified in the directive, the Commission will stop its measures. So far, so good! If this does not happen, I will have to write ‘the Commission will work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, who are you trying to fool? Can you really propose this sort of text to Parliament? I think that the Commission must make a commitment to show respect for the resolutions adopted by Parliament. That, Mr President, is democracy – pure and simple. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And what are we doing today? This is a very important stage in the new European Union's coming into being, and I think we have managed to specify what paper and pencils are to be used, where the entrances will be, which architects to appoint and what they can do and when they can do it on the road towards standardised financial services. What we should not forget in all this, though, is what the edifice will look like, because it will be one of the most important high-rise blocks in the European Union. Following this trial of strength between Parliament, Commission and Council, the issue is now what we want this building to be like. That is the next step and also what we in Parliament expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expectation is that the standardisation of financial services will not result in the problem of consumers having this sort of excess of information, that, in other words, once equal entitlement to them is offered without regard to national frontiers, that it does not come pouring in like a flood of videoclips inundating the consumers, who will then be ‘overnewsed and underinformed’. We, of course, expect to prevent the big businesses' desire for excessive market concentration, resulting in a mere two or three players ending up defining the market. The insurers Allianz have said that they will only go into markets where they will be among the top three, and that, on an international level, will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem is the insecurity of investors. We are implementing this at a time when only 65% of Germans who invest in stocks and shares state that they want to carry on doing so. We live at a time when we have to deal with the collapse of important pension facilities in the USA, and ‘ruinitis’ is going round. This must not be allowed to happen in Europe. There you have a demand for what your legislation should contain. If we end up with USA-style unequal distribution, then we in Europe will have failed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the Commission has committed itself according to the terms of the statement I have read – and it could do no more – but soon it will undertake to work with Parliament to ensure that its institutional rights are fully recognised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has drawn to our attention the importance of financial markets and the Commission wholeheartedly subscribes to her words in that respect. She said so in order to stress the importance of the report by Mr von Wogau and there again the Commission agrees with Mrs Randzio-Plath.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Villiers very succinctly put her finger on the sore spot by saying that a compromise is necessary and that is what we are discussing this morning because the call-back option is not permitted under the Treaty and the comitology procedure. That is perfectly correct. Mrs Villiers then went on to say that we are talking here about benefits for ordinary people. There again the Commission wholeheartedly agrees. Fortunately we are living in the European Union where more and more ordinary people own shares and all we are doing this morning is providing a legislative framework which safeguards the interests of ordinary people. I am very pleased to say that we are making good progress in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have understood Mrs Randzio-Plath correctly, her interpretation implies that the Commission would not go against a simple majority in Parliament. Without saying so she refers to the "aerosol declaration" which the Commission appended to the comitology decision of June 1999. If that is what she meant – this is not the first time that Mrs Randzio-Plath and I have discussed this matter – then that is not a possibility for the Commission because, as Mrs Villiers and other Members of Parliament know, it does not agree with the comitology decision or with Article 202.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address Mr Goebbels' comments. He said that the Commission should show respect for Parliament's resolutions. The Commission does show respect for Parliament's resolutions. More to the point, the Commission has said that it will take the fullest account of Parliament's position. What more can Mr Goebbels want? I should like to add that the Commission has respect for Parliament's resolutions, but it has more respect for the Treaty. It has more respect for the agreed comitology procedure. The Commission shows respect all around but is bound by the formalities of the Treaty and wishes its words to be interpreted in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goebbels also made reference to the word "equivalence". The Commission has very clearly indicated its sympathy with Parliament's position with respect to Article 202. It has laid that down in black and white in the White Paper on comitology. The Commission will continue to work on that basis – as stated by the Commission President, Mr Prodi, when he said that the Commission would continue to do that and, fully respecting the existing institutional balance, the Commission would treat Parliament and the Council on an equal footing. In the end we are striving for what we can achieve only at the next IGC, which hopefully will start in the year 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is close to the hearts of Members of Parliament, may I end by summarising in seven points the safeguards which this Parliament has. Firstly, the extent of delegated powers will be defined through codecision. Secondly, there will be a fully open and transparent process including a market participants' group attached to the European Securities Regulators' Committee. Thirdly, there will be a sunset clause – and this is in response to a specific request from Mr Huhne in this Parliament – limiting the duration of the delegated powers to four years after adoption of each legislative act. Fourthly, the Commission, as I have mentioned a few times this morning, will take the utmost account of Parliament's position and of any resolution – Mr Goebbels – stating that the Commission has exceeded its delegated powers. Fifthly, the Commission will support a change to Article 202 at the next IGC. Sixthly, there will be a full and open review in 2004 and we hope an interinstitutional monitoring group to ensure everyone carries out their commitments connected with the Lamfalussy process. Seventhly and lastly, if the Commission fails to respect its engagements Parliament will not grant any further delegated powers in future. In effect, Parliament can make its voice heard in no uncertain fashion and the Commission is bound to listen to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for their constructive attitude. Mrs Randzio-Plath was kind enough to say a few kind words in my direction. May I reciprocate and say that I have always found the discussions with the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs very fruitful, friendly and, in the end I hope, constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They know that when the comitology procedure was decided on in mid-1999, the Commission issued a unilateral declaration, which has become known as the "aerosol" declaration, which was given in exchange for something called the <span class="italic">contre-filet</span>, another procedural device. The Commission and Council accepted that the <span class="italic">contre-filet</span> procedure would disappear, and in its place came this unilateral declaration, which referred to a much earlier case in connection with veterinary matters. That is why in the unilateral Commission declaration mention was made of particularly sensitive cases, because the veterinary situation back in the early 1980s concerned human health. The declaration stated – again by way of replacement of the <span class="italic">contre-filet</span> procedure – that the Commission would not go against a majority opinion of the Council, thereby basically maintaining the status quo, while bringing things into sharper focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the Stockholm resolution adds nothing beyond what was already in place under the comitology procedure, because the same words – the <span class="italic">ipsissima verba – </span>that appeared in the declaration by the Commission in June 1991 reappear in the resolution of the European Council. So matters have basically remained the same.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr Goebbels is asking on which article this is based, then the reply is on Articles 202 and 211. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
