<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative for the CFSP</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I will try to speak briefly on the two issues suggested to me by the Presidency of Parliament, bearing in mind that you have spent a good sitting debating such an important issue as the enlargement of the European Union, which is surely the most important issue on all of our agendas at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been suggested to me that I speak today on two fundamental issues: the situation in the Middle East and the policy on Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it falls to me to speak on a very special day with regard to two issues which are occupying the front pages of all of today’s newspapers. In the Middle East, as the honourable Members know, a quick – and for some perhaps unexpected – decision by Prime Minister Sharon has led to a change of government and the calling of early elections in Israel at the end of January.</p>
<p class="contents">And with regard to the situation in Iraq, right now in New York, the debate is starting on the Security Council Resolution on Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore comment on these two issues, bearing in mind the restrictions we are faced with at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, since the last time we spoke about this issue, the European Union has continued its work, essentially within the context of the so-called Quartet, that is, with the United States, the Russian Federation and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In September, at the last meeting we held, we tried to implement a three-phase process in order to achieve, by the end of 2005, the dream of so many of us – and of so many Israeli and Palestinian citizens – of having two States which might live together in peace and have a joint future of harmony and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know – and this has been published since the meeting in September – it was expected that this process would involve three phases: a first phase, of what remains of this year and the first part of next year, with the elections in Palestine and with the resolution of the issues of internal reforms and the humanitarian issues which, unfortunately, are yet to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The second phase, to call it that, would involve the declaration of a Palestinian State, though with provisional borders, and the third phase would consist of the final debate on the issues which everybody knows and which are still the most difficult issues to resolve in relation to the Middle East problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the calling of elections does not slow the process down. We in Europe want this process to continue and we want to continue to be involved in the process we began not many months ago in New York within the context of the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Palestinians, however, three important things are happening. Firstly, the internal debate amongst the Palestinians about the strategic significance of the <span class="italic">intifada</span>. I believe that it is essential, from the point of view of Palestinian politics, to see the implementation of a positive, constructive and in-depth debate on the strategic sense of the <span class="italic">intifada</span>. The idea that politics rather than violence should return to the centre of gravity is extremely important. This will undoubtedly provide more security than all the policies and all the security structures which may be implemented on the ground. If in the minds of the citizens it seems that violence has disappeared, that is worth much more than all the security structures which could be implemented on the ground. We are assisting with this debate and let us hope that it yields the desired results, as it is already starting to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue in relation to the Palestinians is the change in the government of the Palestinian Authority carried out by President Arafat and which has the support of the Palestinian Legislative Authority. The two most important things, and the things I would most like to stress in relation to this change in government, are: firstly, the role of the Finance Minister, who has held his post since the first change in government. He is a man who has the agreement, the consensus and the support of the international community and of the international financial institutions. He is doing great work and let us hope that he can continue to work in that direction. Secondly, the change of Interior Minister, in other words, the Minister responsible for security. I believe that this change is also going to play a fundamental role in terms of the speedy development and resolution of the security issue, which is still one of the essential elements of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue I would like to highlight relates to the humanitarian aspects. There is absolutely no doubt that the situation of the Palestinian citizens is still appalling from a humanitarian point of view. We have done everything we can within the European Union and within the Quartet so that the resources belonging to the Palestinian Authority, which are currently still in the hands of the Israeli Government, are returned to the Palestinian Authority immediately, and are returned month by month, so that the Finance Minister may have the capacity to produce a budget worthy of its name with knowledge of the resources available at the beginning of each month.</p>
<p class="contents">The final issue I would like to discuss in relation to Palestine is the settlements. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a serious and grave issue and that, if the settlements are not frozen quickly, we may find that when the time comes to realise the dream of two States, the Palestinian State will not be a realistic proposition because its territory has been so reduced by the number of settlements, which is still increasing. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Union, I therefore once again call on the Israeli Government to freeze the settlements as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of what is taking place in Israel, I will tell you that this afternoon I had a telephone conversation with the new Foreign Minister, Mr Netanyahu. We will be in contact as soon as possible so that no process which can be kept active will be slowed down, even during the election campaign, for the sake of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there are going to be primary elections in the two main parties, the Likud and the Labour Party, over the coming weeks. In the Likud, between Netanyahu and Sharon, and in the Labour Party, in the middle of November, between three candidates, the former Defence Minister, the Mayor of Haifa and the former trade unionist – who was a Minister in the Rabin government – Mr Haim Ramon. We will have to await the result of these primaries before we know which candidates will fight the elections to take place on 28 January. However, I would insist that the fact that elections have been called must not slow down our work towards our aspiration: a just peace in that region which is so dear to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that in relation to Iraq we have today entered the crucial phase. An hour ago the Security Council began to debate its Resolution. Since the first informal meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers during the Danish Presidency, the European Union has maintained a clear position with three essential elements: the objective of the operation on Iraq, the way it should be carried out and our great concerns over its consequences. I would like to make three comments on these three ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I will comment on the objective. Our objective had to be – and still has to be – to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. What has come to be known as regime change was not the European Union’s objective. The objective of the European Union, in any event, is for Iraq to comply with the Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what route should we take in order to achieve this aim? We have always said – we will continue to say it and, fortunately, this has been the case – that this debate should take place within the United Nations. Fortunately, on 12 September, even the President of the United States accepted that the debate on this extremely important problem should take place within the United Nations, and I can say that we are pleased that, from 12 September until now, there have been very serious negotiations between all the members of the Security Council in order to achieve a resolution which we hope can be unanimously approved as soon as possible. This would be the greatest victory for the legitimacy of the United Nations and therefore a victory for those who believe in multilateralism and also in the important role of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know, the resolution on which a debate is starting at the moment is a long resolution, but its fundamental elements are as follows: the recognition that Iraq is currently failing to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council; the second essential element is that Iraq should be given an opportunity to comply with all the resolutions; thirdly, that at the moment in the resolution there should be no possibility of an automatic resort to military action; and fourthly, that Iraq is going to be asked to produce a report within 30 days on the weapons of mass destruction in its possession and allow the inspectors led by Mr Blix to be deployed immediately on the ground to verify President Saddam Hussein’s claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, from the European Union’s point of view, I believe we can take pleasure from the fact that the multilateral context of the United Nations has worked, or is working, well. That is what we, the countries and the citizens of the European Union, have all wanted to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is little more I can say at the moment while we wait to see what might happen in relation to Iraq in the coming hours. It is possible that the debate on the resolution will end today and that the vote will be taken either today or tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Middle East, I would still insist that for us, as Europeans, the Middle East peace process and the problem there will remain amongst the priorities of our foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you that, to a certain extent, the fact that elections in Israel have been brought forward from October next year to January is something that we can view as fundamentally positive, because it is going to allow us to begin early the whole process which should take us to the final phase of negotiations which brings about the two States we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have little more to tell you at this point. If the President will allow me, I would like to say that we are going to continue to work tirelessly on these two issues which are undoubtedly of fundamental importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word or two on the idea of regime change in the countries of the region: ladies and gentlemen, I believe that for us the essential thing is to convert into reality the report on the Middle East, on the Islamic and Arab countries, which has been produced by the United Nations, which demonstrates the needs involved in transformation in those countries. To this end, nothing can be better than dialogue and, therefore, the European Union is going to continue its intense dialogue with the Arab League and also an intense dialogue with the Organisation of the Conference of Islamic States. All of this, together with the Barcelona process, must continue to be the driving force for relations between the European Union and the countries of the region, practically all of which we maintain contractual relations with by means of cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I believe that I have informed you about a situation, as I have said, at this very special time, when so many events are taking place in relation to the Middle East and Iraq, so that you, ladies and gentlemen, may have as much information as possible, and I am at your disposal to answer any questions you may wish to ask me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Solana has already spoken at length concerning the progress of the discussion on the road map being planned by the international community, represented here by the international quartet. The work you have done, Mr Solana, has been done under the most adverse conditions imaginable and no doubt also against the clock; I wish to congratulate you on it and promise you the Commission's continued support. The road map towards which we are working must incorporate a specific timetable and have as its objective the outcome outlined in the Seville Council Declaration, that is, the creation of a viable Palestinian state. I am confident in the future success of the efforts of the Presidency and of Mr Solana to this end, which involve agreement with the other international partners in the quartet on a workable solution. Yet before the road map is laid down, which it is expected to be in December, there are aspects that could even now help to reduce the tension in the situation. These are the unreserved confirmation of the two-state solution that we seek, and even more so the ending of all use of force and provocation by both sides. This would include vigorous action against terrorist organisations alongside the immediate halting of settlements and the bringing under control of settlers' incursions into land owned by Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important that the Palestinians should persevere with their efforts at reform, and the Israelis with the implementation of symbolic responses to them, such as the resumption of regular transfer payments, which they have already announced. The relaxation of restrictions on movement and easier access for humanitarian aid organisations could accentuate this positive trend.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent Israeli Government reshuffle has resulted in a marked shift to the right. It remains to be seen, however, whether the effect on the peace process will actually be as is feared. In any case, the road map remains an international initiative with the prospect of long-term success in the form of a two-state solution. It is to be hoped that the new Palestinian cabinet will continue with the reform work it has started and will, with the help of the international community, not only intensify it, but also use it to bring about marked improvements in the people's conditions. It is precisely here that there are difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been primarily in the area of financial management that the reform process has met with its first successes. The conditions attached to the use of EU funds to support the budget have brought about consolidation and resulted in Palestinian financial arrangements becoming better controlled and more transparent. The Commission will continue to work closely with Salam Fayad, the new Palestinian Finance Minister, and will use further conditions to exert a positive influence on the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">In other fields, regrettably, the reform process has come to something of a halt. This is true, specifically, of reform of the administration and of the justice system, both of which play an important part in establishing a democratic state, and preparations for the elections announced for mid-January have not got very far either. Although a chairman of the electoral commission has been appointed, many Palestinians, and also representatives of the international donor community, believe that postponement of the elections can no longer be ruled out. One of the tasks of the international Task Force will be to bring obstacles to the election preparations to the quartet's attention and suggest ways of dealing with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Member States, the Commission continues to be fully involved in preparations for the elections, and is endeavouring to ensure that all necessary support is given when they are actually held. Neither international efforts at laying down a promising road map, nor the Palestinian Authority's efforts at reform have, however, been able as yet to bring about any improvement in the situation on the spot. On both sides, innocent people are still dying. Daily life is lived in fear of the terrible suicide bombers and of reprisals and against a backdrop of frustration and despair.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, it has not been possible to meet the Israeli people's need for security, or to satisfy the Palestinian people's demand for a more normal everyday life, to put an end to the restrictions on freedom of movement, or to improve the atrocious living conditions. It is the human needs involved that give great cause for concern. International observers on the spot are all agreed that the restrictions on freedom of movement and the lack of access for aid organisations have helped to bring about the present humanitarian crisis. It is quite simply not acceptable for aid missions financed by the EU to be turned back or prevented from doing their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-three instances of this have occurred in the last couple of weeks alone. To give just one example, on 17 October, two Commission officials were stopped on their way out of Israel, and the documents and laptops they were carrying were taken off them, being returned to them only after some considerable time. You will no doubt be well aware that the Commission has sought to have EUR 50 million released from the emergency reserve in order to be able to make additional aid available to towns and villages cut off from the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">Additional financial resources are also required for the preparation of elections, and, in this regard, I hope that the Commission can count on Parliament's support. This is of great importance in terms of the ad hoc liaison meeting that is to take place in December, at which the international donor states will be discussing the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories and the state of the reform process, as well as the need for measures of support and financial aid.</p>

<p class="contents">These ten days, which began with the shocking hostage siege in Moscow, came to a tragic end on 26 October and were also marked by increasing concern regarding the growing political instability in the Middle East and by the possibility of war with Iraq which is still being discussed in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Chechnya and our relations with Russia are concerned, we have just heard Mr Prodi express his commitment, and we are asking you, Mr Solana, to speak on our behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of the entire House, and condemn in the strongest possible terms the cowardly and criminal act of terrorism which took place in Moscow. At the same time, however, you must warn against the response in Russia by the public and by some of those responsible for combating terrorism who could confuse the ordinary Chechen population with the extremists who are guilty of preparing and carrying out this crime.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the trap that the terrorists wanted the Russian people and government to fall into. And if they do, there is a danger that they will prove the terrorists’ action right.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in the Middle East, we have seen political chaos increasing over recent days and almost with each passing hour and this obviously cannot serve the cause of peace. In this respect, Mr Solana, I do not share your optimism. This is because, first of all, on 29 October, the new government of the Palestinian Authority, approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council, was presented with, as you said, a broad majority. President Arafat was still, however, the target of severe criticism even within this House, due to the ineffective reshuffle which kept most of the ministers axed by the same Council in their posts. And the fact that, on this occasion, the Minister of Finance was able to keep his job – you welcomed this – but that the former Interior Minister, who had the courage to call for the end to the violence perpetrated by both sides, was able to be axed, seems, in our view, a very worrying sign that, in this new Cabinet, the hawks may have prevailed over the artisans of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, a crisis ensued within the government in Israel which led to the Knesset being dissolved and early elections being called. These could take place even before the date of 28 January that is currently predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that, when this crisis broke out, the Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon did not give in to a far-right majority which intended to condemn the Oslo Accords, expel Arafat and reject the creation of a Palestinian State. We must fear, however, that this majority will continue to rage throughout the upcoming election campaign, but we also hope that the Israeli people, most of whom are still passionate about peace, will not allow themselves to be carried away by the far-right action.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect as well, we are counting on you and on your representative, Ambassador Moratinos, to try, against the backdrop of increasingly uncontrolled violent outbreaks, to make the conciliatory voice of Europe heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we hope that the same conciliatory voice will also be heard within the United Nations Security Council, by those who have been involved in tough negotiations, as you said, for six weeks, to redraft a resolution which places Iraq squarely before its responsibilities, but which still offers the prospect of a solution that does not inevitably involve the use of weapons.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, with regard to the situation in the Middle East, I must state that, following the escalation we have seen in recent months, Mr Solana’s words give grounds for hope. I must say that, given the experiences of the last year, the announcement of forthcoming elections in Israel is to be welcomed, firstly because the voice of the people must always be listened to and, secondly, because my group – and friends sometimes have to say things that are unpleasant – publicly criticised the Israeli Labour Party for its participation in the current government and in spring asked it to withdraw from it. I believe that we should welcome the Labour Party’s withdrawal from the government and also its reason for leaving, which was its refusal to vote for funds for new settlements. This is a very significant fact, because I share the view expressed by Mr Solana that the greatest danger we currently face is that of the occupied territories’ ending up as a real Swiss cheese, as a type of Bantustan, which will make the creation of a Palestinian State impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mr Netanyahu has called Mr Solana, I would ask him to tell Mr Netanyahu, first of all, that although we have taken stock of the destruction that has taken place, we are prepared to support not only humanitarian action but also the reconstruction of the bases on which a Palestinian Authority could exist. Mr Solana should also tell him that, instead of bulldozers, he should perhaps send in ballot-boxes and encourage elections to be held for the Palestinian Authority too. I think that this would be a major step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to believe that the far right could mount a challenge and indulge in blackmail against a trio such as Messrs Sharon, Netanyahu and Mofaz. They have truly been one step away from the abyss, but have realised that there is no alternative to the proposal by the Quartet and to the creation of two States and I believe that we must persevere with this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the situation in Iraq, it should be emphasised that, despite our differences, we in Europe have managed to ensure that this issue has been addressed in the United Nations, that this has been done within an international framework and also that not only has the authority of the United Nations Security Council been recognised once again but also that an opening has been created that will enable us to avoid, if I might put it this way, fire being poured onto the oil, which would run the major risk of setting the entire region alight.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to know how Mr Solana is going to help the European Union Member States of the Security Council, of which there will certainly be four in January, to coordinate their action as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to make a very brief comment on the situation in Chechnya. My group fully supports the view expressed by Parliament in its Resolution, that is to say, total condemnation of the terrorist attack, an expression of solidarity with the victims, some criticism of the way in which the Russian State acted, also with regard to the lives and safety of its own citizens, and the need, not in this context, but the need to include the importance of reaching a negotiated solution on the agenda of our next summit with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, Mr President, and with this I shall conclude, I believe we must encourage Mr Solana, the Vice-President of the Commission and our representatives to continue the efforts to mediate and to achieve a de-escalation that they have been making in these three conflicts</p>

Victims among the civilian population are always unacceptable, whether they are at the hands of suicide attacks or the army. For years, Europe has tried to play a significant role in the conflict, but we are mainly fighting the symptoms rather than the root causes of the disease. What needs to happen is for people to start believing in the future again. People who have hope in the future have something to lose and are therefore prepared to fight for peace instead of plodding along in the status quo or, even worse, thinking that violence is the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee a promising future, we demand serious efforts from both sides. The Palestinian Authority must, in the first instance, adopt a much tougher stance with regard to suicide attacks. Terrorists are not heroes, but killers, and must be approached accordingly. In addition, the Palestinian Authority must reform, and stamp out corruption, so that the Palestinian population can have confidence in their leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we ask Israel to call an end to the policy of using closures as a means of economic strangulation and humiliation. Payments to the Palestinians must also be resumed so that European money can once again be used for development projects in education and care rather than payment support. In addition, it remains unacceptable that settlements are still allowed to expand. The occupation and the settlements remain the biggest obstacle to real peace and security for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ashamed of the lack of European resolve in the area of the Middle East. Every day, innocent people die, and all we do is settle for declarations and meetings. As Palestine's largest donor and Israel's biggest trading partner, we should surely be able to do something more to accomplish our own European goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with a comment about the forthcoming elections. Unfortunately, neither of the parties has put a sound peace plan on the table. It is really time that this was done, so that in January, Israelis and Palestinians will be able to vote for peace for themselves and for their neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was extremely surprised, however – since President Bush has not yet ruled out the threat of another war against Iraq, with or without the UN resolution – that the Brussels European Council found nothing to say about this. Moreover, the Union in its current form has hardly said anything about this highly sensitive issue. The only ones taking action are a few States that are members of the Security Council, and also some forces of peace which are working together. In this area, Mr Kucinich, a member of the US Congress and Chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus sends us this message: ‘We can still avoid this war. Let us work together for peace, cooperation, for a new era in human relations where war has no place. I welcome every opportunity to work with you to create this new world’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I dream of a Europe, of a united Europe capable of taking up the challenge before it. Europe does not do this at the moment, this is the existential challenge that we must accept.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, more than twenty years ago, there was the declaration from the Venice European Council, which called for an end to the Israeli occupation, which stressed that the settlements were illegal, which acknowledged the right to Palestinian self-rule and which insisted that the PLO must be involved in the negotiations. That was more than twenty years ago! Much more recently, in March 1999, the declaration of the Berlin Summit explicitly recognised the right of the Palestinians to a State. But today, when the situation is worsening dramatically day by day, when the Oslo Accords are cast aside and forgotten, when the radical elements of the occupiers responds to the radical elements of a part of the occupied, how can we interpret the silence of the European Union Member States? My group does not believe that this can go on, that the silence and the half-hearted measures can continue. We need firm initiatives which can demonstrate to the world, and more importantly to the peoples of the region, a political, clear will, encouraging the supporters of peace to take action. We need to kick-start this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, I shall put forward a practical proposal. The Thursday of our next sitting will be the eve of the 35th anniversary of the celebrated UN Security Council Resolution 242 which is one of the international community’s major reference points in the conflict. Well, I suggest we organise a formal occasion involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission in Strasbourg. I suggest we also involve young supporters of peace, young Europeans, young Palestinians, young Israelis, those who gathered en masse last Saturday in Tel Aviv to commemorate the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Each of our institutions will therefore be able to state clearly what, in its view, in accordance with international law and our common values, is unacceptable and, conversely, what type of plan for fair and lasting peace we want to draft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that our role is to be clear-headed and to state the truth. Mr Wurtz is right in saying that twenty years ago we condemned, twenty years ago we …We say this to the Israelis. That is right and it is true. And to the Palestinians we must say: twenty years ago, we said you must acknowledge not only the State of Israel but also that there would be no mass return of Palestinians to that State of Israel. Both these things are true. If we want to give some hope to the Israeli population, we must eradicate the fear. They fear the attacks, the fatal, suicide attacks, which above all mean that those who carry out these attacks do not recognise the State of Israel. The Palestinians fear occupation by the Israeli army. The two things are very closely related.</p>
<p class="contents">And then in Iraq, the truth is straightforward. We say that Iraq must recognise the UN resolutions, in other words, all weapons, if they exist that is – and I know nothing about that, I had never been an inspector, nor have you, nor have any of us, no one here in fact – must be destroyed after they have been inspected. The way in which Saddam Hussein conducts politics and has conducted politics in the past is a danger to other nations. Therefore, we must also call for weapons inspectors and for non-governmental organisations to be allowed in to inspect the democratic situation and the relationship between the Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to Russia and Chechnya. It is quite incredible that Russian women and children were indeed taken hostage, and we condemn this. It is even more incredible that Mr Putin then took the hostages hostage, failing to say how they were, which gases were to be used, and failed to communicate the information at his disposal to the families. It is equally incredible that the entire Chechen population can be taken hostage by a former KGB man who is acting as if the Bolsheviks and Communists were still in power, as a KGB agent, in other words.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must condemn the attacks, Europe must take part in anti-terrorist actions and Europe must say no to all totalitarian impulses, even if a power such as Russia is involved. The Duma voted in favour of restricting the right to information which is tantamount to restricting democracy. If Europe remains silent in the face of Putin’s actions, then Europe will not have had the insight or the strength to safeguard democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">It is clear that we are creating a new Afghanistan with the Taliban, but I would like to focus on a very specific point. A few days ago, Mr Akhmed Zakayev, the deputy prime minister of the Chechen Government, was arrested in Copenhagen, where he is still being detained, and all attempts to make it possible for Ilias Akhmadov, the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs, to return to the European Union from the United States are being blocked. Therefore, in addition to turning a blind eye to the events in Chechnya, we are preventing the few democratic interlocutors who are in a position to discuss and propose democratic solutions for the country from getting on with their job.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, Mr Solana, is the following: you took the initiative of drawing up black lists of those implicated in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Could you not now take the initiative of drawing up a positive list of people whom we consider to be essential for dialogue, so that these people can obtain visas without hindrance and without injury to a small country which is then subjected, as is the case of Denmark and Belgium, to intolerable pressure from the Russian Federation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let there be no doubt about the fact that Iraq must unconditionally comply with all the requirements made of it. Such is the EU's position, and it is one with whose substance I agree wholeheartedly. There is now justifiable concern about the way Iraq deploys weapons of mass destruction and makes them widely available. Saddam Hussein has already, on several occasions, demonstrated his readiness to deploy such weapons of mass destruction against his own people. The memories of all of us are still scarred by the Kurds of Halabja, who were killed by poison gas. The brutal persecution of the Shiites in the south of the country is no secret either. Weapons of mass destruction are in the hands of the most diverse regimes and countries, whether one thinks of India or Pakistan or, lastly, of North Korea, which has, indeed, admitted diverting fissile material for nuclear weapons, a breach of international undertakings that amounts to an offensive aimed at getting the pressure off Iraq!</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, weapons of mass destruction will only become an incalculable menace to the international community if the rulers with control of them are themselves unpredictable and menacing, as is without doubt true of Saddam Hussein. That is why the Security Council resolution must spell out the necessity of the UN inspectors being able to perform their duties unhindered, of the monitoring teams' powers being extended and of there being no repeat of the cat and mouse game we have seen before. If anyone is to make political visits to Iraq at this time, then it should be international weapons inspectors and nobody else – and I say this with reference to the visit to Iraq of the provincial governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, which is his third, and is superfluous and contrary to Austrian interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is far too hazardous a minefield and also deserves better than to be used to satisfy neurotic political egos. Rather than solo acts, what is needed here is concerted action at EU level, which should be undertaken in partnership with the USA. The risk should also be calculable. We must avoid any escalation or any security vacuum affecting the whole of the Middle East. Looking further ahead, there is a need to work at removing the causes of crises, whether they are in Chechnya or in the Middle East, and you have my full support in doing that.</p>

Mr Joshi Belin, one of the well-known brains behind the Oslo Conventions, assured me only the other day that, despite the fact that the conventions had been seriously undermined by the Sharon regime on the one hand and by Palestinian suicide bombers on the other, what the citizens of both sides need more than ever at this very moment are structural political proposals which offer the prospect of peace. He emphasised once again that European action is essential to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that this Parliament once adopted a resolution which said that the trade clauses in the association treaty must be applied, if necessary, to ensure that settlement policy is brought to an end, which will otherwise continue to form a structural barrier to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Iraq is concerned, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to emphasise once again that neither the US, nor China, nor any other country has, therefore, the unilateral right to begin a large-scale war, wherever in the world. Our approach is by way of the Security Council, a route which, fortunately, we have managed to make binding on a multilateral basis. However, that also means that we may not have any pronouncements that might lead automatically to war. I am really pleased with Mrs Morillon’s statement, which has emphasised that once more on behalf of the PPE-DE. What we need is not war as a reflex response but to bring massive pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein via weapons inspections. The weapons inspections must be effective and, if anything is going on, action can be taken. What we do not need, however, is to go down the road leading to unilateral war. Our first task is to strengthen the coalition against terrorism. This coalition must be our top priority, both from the US side and the European side. Our joint effort must be tied up with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The United States calls the tune and we are merely supporting players. Given our position, this is wrong. We are, after all, Israel’s largest trading partner. Our contribution of EUR 14 billion also makes us the biggest provider of humanitarian aid. The European Union also makes by far the biggest contribution towards technical and financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority, estimated at EUR 10 million per month. It is therefore high time that Europe stopped being just a payer and became a genuine player in the peace process. We have a duty to Israel and Palestine to do so, but also to ourselves for reasons of a historic, cultural, geographic, economic and political nature.</p>
<p class="contents">From our European tradition, we must stress that violence is not a solution and that peace must not come directly from the top but rather must start at grass roots level. Terrorists follow no political agenda. We must therefore ensure that every example of senseless violence is condemned by public opinion, so that terrorist acts will no longer thwart peace negotiations. Europe can and must play an executive role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must persevere with the democratisation and economic development of the region. We must add a more political dimension to our extensive humanitarian aid by making the Palestinians and Israelis realise that they cannot be at enmity with each other for evermore. A greater and more regular political presence in the region is therefore required more than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The determination of the US President, spurred on by the Republican Party’s results in the various US elections that were held recently, is as strong as ever. He has not relinquished his concept of ‘preventative war’, a euphemism used to legitimise war anywhere and at any time on the pretext of combating terrorism. Disregarding the debate which is currently going on in the Security Council, the preparations therefore continue with regard to Iraq. The possibility of the United States’ using its formidable military superiority to secure its economic interests in the region may take precedence over all other considerations. This war will have terrible consequences if it goes ahead, but we must reiterate that the war against the Iraqi people never came to an end; they are a people held hostage by an embargo which kills, first and foremost, children and the weak but safeguards Saddam Hussein and his family.</p>
<p class="contents">The warlike approach that the US President is pursuing fuels the warlike approach being pursued by Ariel Sharon against the advice of the Palestinian people, but also against the security of his own people. Palestinian society and the foundations of a State are destroyed; everyday life is becoming increasingly impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">A war will only serve to intensify the suffering of the region’s people, will only further delay a political solution for a just and lasting peace. The consequences of this war are as yet incalculable, but we know that the arrogant and aggressive attitude of American imperialism might well engender acts of terrorism, as a mirrored response, a barbaric riposte to excessive barbarism. We have nothing to gain from this barbaric action.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, the peoples of Europe and of the United States must count on themselves, because, in spite of their declarations, if Bush pushes ahead with his deadly plan, our governments will provide aid and support as they have always done, because they do not dare do otherwise. We must count on ourselves therefore, as in the United States and the United Kingdom, where hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating against this war which they do not want to be waged in their name.</p>
<p class="contents">The first European social summit begins tomorrow in Florence. Thousands of people will take part in discussions to come up with a different world order. This requires a radically new approach, that of responding to needs rather than to profits, because it is the only way to achieve real justice, the only guarantee of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People and nations who have nothing to lose but their lives will be ready to sacrifice those lives for a future with dignity, a life lived in freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also not forget this issue in international relations. Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship is a disaster for the inhabitants of Iraq, especially for those who oppose it, particularly the Kurds and the Shiites. Let us hope he will be condemned at some point, but we must give him no excuse for war because of the oil issue, and Europe must make that very clear to the United States.

There is a theory that you have not mentioned, however, and that is if Iraq no longer has any weapons of mass destruction, what happens then? Well, I shall tell you: we will continue to say that Iraq is concealing weapons of mass destruction. And in the Security Council resolution that you have outlined to us, something is blatantly missing, and that is what happens to the sanctions if, by chance, Iraq once again agrees, as it did for many years, to allow UN observers in? The condition to lift sanctions – which is causing starvation amongst the Iraqi people – was not respected by the US and British Governments, and that is the reason, the only reason, why Iraq had enough of the observers, who, as a number of them acknowledged, behaved like spies.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, Mr President, the war has started. The air attacks are unrelenting. On 10 October, Bassora airport was bombed three times.

As<span class="italic"> Ha’aretz</span> states in its editorial this morning, the government that has just resigned has been a terrible one. Its policy of using force in the occupied territories has not ended terrorism and has inflicted the greatest human bloodshed on Israel since the war in Lebanon. Its relations with Egypt and Jordan and even with Europe itself have never been worse, as we know. There has not been so much fear and so little hope in Israel for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic situation, as we also know, is terrible. Unemployment is increasing. This is, of course, largely although not entirely due, in my opinion, to the war with the Palestinians, which is incompatible with prosperity. The advocates of peace have to go to enormous lengths to convince the majority of their fellow citizens that any improvement in their economic and social situation depends precisely on re-establishing political negotiations with the Palestinians; that a new national agreement must be reached in order to reach a good agreement with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinians, for their part, must understand that an absence of terrorism in Israel will help these advocates of peace. I believe that the Palestinians are moving in that direction. It was announced on Israeli radio yesterday that Al Fatah and Hamas will meet next week in Cairo to negotiate an end to suicide attacks in Israel by Hamas. I wonder if Israel will frustrate these efforts, as it has done on previous occasions, with a new deadly assault on Gaza or the West Bank.</p>

Nor is there any dispute as to the right of any state to refuse to be blackmailed by such terrorist acts and to take appropriate counter-measures. These, though, must be aimed only at the terrorists and must not make an entire people culpable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is room for criticism of the Russian leadership's lack of candour in handling public relations after the hostages were released, with particular reference to the delay in getting medical aid for the freed hostages and the way their families were prevented from visiting them in hospital. There is also the question of why, unlike the hostages, the special forces that were sent in suffered no adverse health effects through the gas, even though they were operating without gas masks. If eyewitness reports are accurate in stating that the hostages' captors were shot while still unconscious, then that represents a flagrant breach of every system of law and must therefore be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence can never be the solution to a problem; only peaceful means will do. That is why the Russian Government must be told that, if they, in effect, label an entire people, and its elected representatives, as terrorists, then by so doing they are depriving themselves of the last partner with whom they can even attempt to resolve this problem in a peaceful way.

I hear talk of very large sums of money that the European Union is about to appropriate in further aid. There needs to be the greatest possible transparency in the distribution of this aid and its management, for the experience of previous situations teaches us that such aid is very often appropriated for specific objectives – and if they are humanitarian objectives I endorse them, we all endorse them – but then it goes off track. The situation of these countries, particularly the ongoing situation in Palestine – a political and social situation in which there are opposing groups and feuds – is such as to suggest that such aid might be used for the activities of groups such as <span class="italic">Hamas</span>, for example, with the result that funds donated as humanitarian aid end up being aid to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Europe’s policy on Iraq, however, I feel that we must not confine ourselves to purely diplomatic measures but, mindful of the commitments made after September 11, exploit all the possibilities offered by intelligence in order to get to the heart of the matter and tackle the roots of terrorism, which are in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States.

Be that as it may, the situation in the Middle East and in the Near East requires us to be more vigilant than ever. Despite the fact that, in a few months’ time, the people will be able to have a say in their future by taking part in two elections, I feel that we must turn our attention to this part of the world immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Palestinian elections, we must support the desire of the Palestinian people to have political leaders who are representative and who have greater democratic legitimacy – which we must now acknowledge – and we must do everything in our power to ensure that these elections are able to take place as they should.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, my question is what technical and practical assistance is the European Union planning to provide? I would like to know what will be done in specific terms and within what timeframe?</p>
<p class="contents">As for the elections in Israel, I perceive them to be more of a cause for concern than a source of hope. These elections are, admittedly, an opportunity for civil society in Israel to demonstrate its desire for peace in a region, no part of which has escaped this horror. However, this delay might also be exploited by those who fuel this conflict and do not want to see the two peoples living side by side in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the European Union, which is able to provide support in economic and humanitarian terms, at last take the decision to strengthen its presence on the ground, to stop being excessively cautious in the diplomatic arena and contribute to dialogue and to negotiations?

I should like to emphasise once again that, where the Middle East is concerned, when we meet in Parliament, we should try not always to start from the beginning and instead work on the assumption that all of us gathered here basically believe that an entire people is suffering, that an entire people has had a very hard time for many years, that this problem must be resolved and that we must attempt to provide solutions.

We want there to be, as soon as possible, two States that can live together, democratically, side by side with one another, in peace and prosperity. And this is the task to which we in the European Union must contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that we have reason to be optimistic. Or pessimistic. It is up to each individual to decide on what view to take. Personally, I should like at this point in time to be realistic and to try to work towards achieving specific and tangible results at this difficult juncture and I believe that this is what the European Union is doing. We do not need to make grand declarations. We have already done that. We now need to attempt to resolve the problems that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">We have pointed out, for example, that in Palestine an open and rich debate is taking place, which could bring an end to terrorism. Which could bring it to an end in intellectual terms and forever, if that is possible. The European Union is also making a very significant and effective contribution to this debate, and this has been acknowledged by everyone, amongst the Palestinians and amongst the most intelligent strata of Israeli society, who also understand the importance of this role. Let us therefore try to come up with not only declarations of principles, but concrete actions that will lead to a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Palestinian friends must undertake reforms, which they have not yet done to any sufficient degree and on this matter I must agree with my friend, Mr Morillon. Their efforts must continue. I would have liked to see a prime minister in the Palestinian Authority, but this has not been possible, perhaps because the actions of Mr Arafat, who has been holed up in the Mukata for all this time, and who has lost the energy that he had established to ensure that change could be initiated for a more open government, which would also have had a prime minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the Palestinians are concerned, then, we must ask them to continue to combat terrorism and also to continue to undertake reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">And where Israel is concerned, the most important thing that we can ask for at the moment is for it to lift its block of the territories and for people to be able to move around freely; for a journey between one town and another, which previously took half an hour, not to take Mr Solana eight hours. This is what is happening at the moment – the territories are effectively closed off. No economy, however much aid we give it, can survive unless its citizens enjoy freedom of movement. This is, therefore, an absolutely crucial element. Secondly, payments must be made. The Israelis must hand over the taxes that they collect so that the Palestinian Authority has a budget with which to see its actions through.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore use the time remaining until the end of year, until elections are held, to try to establish conditions for a debate on peace and for peace, which there can be during the electoral campaign, and let us do everything within our power to ensure that the Quartet, of which we are an integral and fundamental part, continues to work ceaselessly in the forthcoming months, which will be so crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a couple of things about Iraq: the European Union has attempted to achieve many of the things that the majority of Europe’s citizens had in mind. What did we want to see? We wanted to see the weapons inspectors return to Iraq. We wanted this to be achieved under the auspices of the United Nations, and we also wanted there to be no automatic initiation of military action. Three things. These three things have been achieved. This entire debate has taken place to ensure that the observers can return. And they will be returning. This has been achieved under the auspices of the United Nations and is being discussed this very afternoon. It has also been achieved without the Security Council Resolution automatically allowing recourse to war, because it is a Resolution in two phases. We have therefore managed, in one way or another, and with the efforts of many countries, including many countries that are not Members of the European Union, to make progress along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We also acknowledge, however, that there is a risk posed by weapons of mass destruction, and that this is not the problem of just one country. This is not a problem for the United States alone, but for every country in the world. We too have to fight against weapons of mass destruction. It is in our interest and is our obligation as civilised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not spoken longer on the third issue – Chechnya – for two reasons: first, because the Presidency of the Council and the President of the Commission have already spoken on this matter at some length and I fully agree with everything that has been said. On Monday, as you all know, a summit will take place here, in Brussels, at which all of these issues will doubtless be addressed with President Putin. Therefore, Mr President, and I do not think that I am exceeding the time allotted to me, I should like once again to state my willingness to discuss these issues further, but to do so in order to attempt to find solutions to the extremely difficult problems that we face, to ensure that we are not always starting from first principles, with which we are already familiar and on which we are all agreed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mr Solana has reminded us, we are running late because it is impossible to limit Members’ speaking time to the minute or minute and a half scheduled on the agenda, but I would ask everyone to make every effort to stick to the times because otherwise, we will end up having no time for our debate.</p>
