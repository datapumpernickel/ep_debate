This would in fact involve accepting the automatic mutual recognition of judicial decisions freezing certain assets or evidence in the context of inquiries concerning certain defined offences. This approach provides a useful means of stepping up cooperation while respecting the legal systems in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We would even be in favour of a more clear-cut approach. Under the text proposed, the new mutual recognition procedure would apply to freezing orders in the context of very precise and specifically listed offences, that is to say drug trafficking, fraud affecting the European Communities’ financial interests, laundering of the proceeds of crime, counterfeiting of the euro, corruption and trafficking in human beings. However, other important offences are missing from this list. These need to be curbed as a matter of urgency, as in the case of terrorism, which we have denounced once again over the last few days. That is why the Members from the Movement for France support Amendment No 5, which provides for a broader definition of the offences targeted, that is all offences punishable by means of a custodial sentence or custodial security measure with a maximum duration of at least six months.</p>
<p class="contents">If there were a need to go beyond the freezing of assets or evidence, we should study in greater depth an improved right of safeguard system, which can be used effectively but also rapidly by the Member State receiving the application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Federal Republic at present, the issue of immigration/asylum legislation and residence rights in Germany are the subject of a very broad debate. The Federal government, the German Bundestag, the <span class="italic">Länder</span>, party commissions and cross-party commissions have been engaged in an intensive debate on issues which to some extent fall within the scope of the Watson report, and we are currently in the process of debating legislation within Parliament and between Parliament, the Federal government and the Bundesrat. Against this background, the SPD representatives in this House have been presented with Commission proposals, the opinions of the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt – now Mr Watson – and proposals from the various groups which partly conform and partly conflict with the domestic policy issues facing Social Democrats in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">On a number of points, we have therefore deviated from our group's voting behaviour or rejected the proposals. Here, our apparent proximity to the PPE-DE Group exists solely on paper, for our substantive views are generally different from theirs. However, we joined our group in supporting the Watson report in the final vote out of our sense of Social Democratic loyalty, although in terms of German constitutional law, we had major concerns on a number of issues which we believed it was important to voice. I felt I should explain this background because when the vote was taken in this House, we had yet to reach a position in the domestic policy debate. As a result, some of what we have agreed here does not necessarily tie in with what we are debating at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My amendments had a single purpose – and I thank Mr Fatuzzo for recalling it and pointing it out – which is to prevent the improper use of the institution of asylum and that of the political refugee: we are running the risk of encouraging illegal immigration which, as another Member of this Parliament has highlighted in the debates of these few days, also breeds terrorism.

Parliament has also, however, found the means to add amendments which worsen these defects still further and strengthen our opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the original proposal envisaged, in principle, that an appeal against a ruling rejecting a request for asylum would have a suspensive effect, permitting the asylum-seeker to remain in the territory of the country in question while awaiting a final decision, but States would be able to claim an exception to this rule in certain instances, for example, where a request was rejected as manifestly unfounded. The European Parliament, however, removed this exception by means of Amendment No 85. The result of this is that, even where a request is manifestly unfounded, the applicant could then remain on our territory while awaiting a final ruling on his appeal. This intention is confirmed by the adoption of Amendment No 5, which seeks to create a "right to remain on the territory of the country of asylum until the reaching of a final decision". Furthermore, the adoption of Amendment No 96 prevents Member States from dodging this disaster because it prevents them from abolishing the option of appealing where a request for asylum has been turned down on the grounds of being manifestly unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">All these amendments are extremely serious, because they aim to settle notoriously persistent asylum seekers down for months on end to await a definitive ruling, which is bound to be negative. In the meantime, however, they will, of course, have disappeared and gone underground.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who voted for these provisions know full well what they are doing. They want to promote massive immigration, as demonstrated by the rejection of Amendment No 126 which stated that a request for asylum is manifestly unfounded if it is made only "for economic reasons or with the sole object of escaping from a general situation of poverty or from an armed conflict". The blow that this would deal to our countries could contribute to destabilising them even further.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These proposals provide for basic norms in three key areas: the authority responsible for determining the receivability of the asylum applications, the independent institution to which the asylum seekers can resort to re-examine their application and the appeal procedure. In particular we welcome the time limits introduced for the processing of applications which will ensure that the current backlog in many member states will be cleared and a fairer procedure brought into place.</p>
<p class="contents">However it must be remembered that the attempt to establish common norms regarding safe country, and the concept of safe country of origin, in general is restrictive and could be used and abused by member states. I know that in Ireland, my own country, the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future. These agreements are to speed up the procedure of deportation and fall far short of what should be done. We feel a thorough examination of each asylum demand and a decision should be based on each individual case. It is essential that these concepts should not be enshrined in the Directive as it would open the way for abuses of all kind, and I feel the same applies to speeding up asylum procedures which could also downgrade the quality of the procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of asylum policy is no exception to this imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">Today even more than yesterday, the Watson report's proposals appear to be an example of what should not be done, because their ultimate effect would be to gravely and dangerously weaken the degree of security which the citizens of our countries must enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">To multiply, indefinitely and to the point of absurdity, the guarantees of all sorts which the Watson report and the amendments adopted by Parliament propose to bestow on asylum-seekers whose requests have been adjudged to be manifestly unfounded, even though we know that three quarters of asylum requests fall into this category, may appear to be generous, but it opens the door to the gravest errors. The concept of ‘benefit of the doubt’ is difficult to reconcile with the demands of security. At a time when the most rigorous measures are being put in place, our Parliament is indulging in an extremely lax approach which can only lead to an increase in illegal immigration and, along with this, further infiltration by terrorist networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Why then do all the Watson report's proposals deal exclusively with asylum-seekers and none of them with the security of the citizens of European countries? Such an imbalance, which, I might add, is found in the proposal for a directive as much as in the Watson report, is not acceptable. It is imperative that it be corrected so that both the legitimate rights of genuine asylum-seekers and the legitimate desire of our countries' citizens for security and protection may be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fine piece of work which highlights several key points. I would like to stress the following aspects:</p>
<p class="contents">1. Cohesion is a treaty objective which it is vital to implement</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and social cohesion, which is laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as one of the essential objectives of the Union, stipulates that the present disparities between the various regions should be reduced and possible imbalances should be prevented, with a view to promoting the harmonious development of the Community. In reality, there is still a great deal to be done to achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Cohesion Fund fills a vital gap</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion also has a fundamental role to play in progress towards economic and monetary union, which implies convergence between the economies of the Member States. However, as the rapporteur rightly emphasises, the Maastricht Treaty did not provide for any support or cyclical adjustment measures within the framework of economic and monetary union, which means that the Structural Funds and in particular the Cohesion Fund are all the more important.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The objective of cohesion will not end with enlargement</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur draws attention to the fact that the disparities between the present Member States could increase because of the impact and dynamics of enlargement. It is important to prevent this from happening and to respond to the temptations offered by those who, armed with statistics, are preparing to do away with the cohesion effort between the present 15 Member States. The objective of cohesion will not come to an end with enlargement; indeed it may and should be reinforced following enlargement. This will make enlargement an enormous challenge for the solidarity of the Union, requiring careful and efficient preparation taking into account the Union as a whole and its specific characteristics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The relentless law of asymmetrical development operating within the capitalist system is not a figment of our imagination, it is a reality and the figures in the Commission's own reports confirm that there can be no talk of convergence; on the contrary, what we have is divergence between the Member States of the Community, between the rich and poor regions, even between regions within a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">A typical example is Greece, where the GNP of regions such as Epirus, Mytilene or the Peloponnese has fallen rather than risen. The per capita income in Hamburg is 440% higher than in Epirus, which is the poorest region in the ΕU. In Greece and Portugal, 22% of the population are living below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions by the ΕU are exacerbating social and economic differences, thereby giving the monopolies more and more options. EMU and the Stability Pact deprive the Member States of the right to exercise monetary policy, impose budgetary discipline and reduce social expenditure and public-sector investments. And people's earnings and the country's economy are being hit particularly hard by privatisation and, in more general terms, the structural changes being pushed forward in the form of liberalisation of the markets and reactionary decisions on the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevalence of atypical, short-term and temporary forms of employment, part-time employment and changes to the national insurance system, along with the concentration of capital, are exacerbating what is already an unacceptable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural interventions funded from the Community purse are not designed to bring about real development in each region. They disregard what is unique to and the comparative advantages of each region and are dictated by big business's demand for greater profitability and the need to serve the objectives of the Stability Pact. As a result of this policy, considerable sums of money are being spent on showcase projects, on scrapping traditional productive sectors and on creating infrastructure works which serve private capital, helping to liberalise the markets and boost the unaccountability of the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The workers are fighting these political choices and aims on the part of the ΕU and the adverse impact which they generate, an impact which is being paid for by the poorest sections of society, workers and pensioners, farmers with small or medium-sized holdings and small enterprises, especially in the processing and trade sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also believe, however, that the thinking underlying these funds contradicts the neo-liberal thinking behind European integration. It is all very well to "link island, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions", but it would be even better not to fragment Europe still further by the systematic privatisation of public services. Seen in this light, the report does not go far enough in its critique and postulates that the financial criteria of the euro and of the Stability Pact can be reconciled with the demands of real regional development. That is why we have abstained – so as not to give succour to such an illusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of convergence and cohesion, divergence is worsening, widening the gap between the rich and poor.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the report admits that the ΕU "still exhibits major regional asymmetries in economic and social development [and] regional asymmetries have actually increased within some Member States". The golden triangle formed by Yorkshire, Franche-Comté and Hamburg accounts for almost half (47%) the income but only one-seventh of the surface area and one-third of the population of the ΕU, while 18% of the population of the EU is living below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of ‘labour mobility’ strategies, which strengthen migration towards and the concentration of wealth in the rich central regions of the Union, flexible forms of employment and unbridled privatisation within this triangle, all policies, both national and Community, come second to the law of maximum profit. Instead of creating jobs, we have mass redundancies and spiralling unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the report tells us that the ten poorest regions have an unemployment rate of 23%. In the countries which are the main beneficiaries of Structural Funds, that is, Italy, Spain and Greece, there was a clear increase in unemployment between 1988 and 1998, especially in Greece, where the official unemployment rate of 6.7% in 1988 compares with 11.7% in 1998, an increase of about 75%.</p>
<p class="contents">These structural interventions are not designed to bring about real development in each region which takes account of its unique features; on the contrary, they come second to even bigger profits for big business. Not only are funds for structural interventions both insufficient and limited, 30-40% of total funding received by the poorest Member States finds its way back to the richest Member States in the form of payment for know-how or capital equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">And this funding has been paid for by scrapping traditional productive sectors, changing crops, destroying agricultural produce and deserting areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The ones who suffer as a result are the poorest sections of society, while the ones who benefit are the monopoly behemoths and the various rodents which surround them, in that Community funds are the "pieces of silver" paid for integration into the ΕU; in a way they are a form of compensation to big business for doing away with much of the protectionism which it enjoys under a national market system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its insistent demand for “the implementation of an integrated policy to promote women's interests" is laudable and highlights an important area in which we have fallen behind. We, too, consider that “the risk exists that economic and budgetary stability programmes could result in cutbacks in public investment, notably in transport infrastructure and R &amp; D in the less-favoured regions”.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not follow its analysis through to its conclusion, however, and does not adequately break free of such restraint. On employment, for example, it invites the States to “continue with the employment policy process launched in Amsterdam” and makes the “national action plans for employment” its reference point. The latter, however, merely translate into operational terms the dogma of the necessary flexibility of labour markets and are in practice contrary to the fight against precariousness to which the rapporteur refers elsewhere.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, now that the 1994-1999 period has come to an end, the 11th Report bears witness to the fact that the cohesion situation remains unsatisfactory. Despite the budgetary effort made with the Edinburgh package and the progress achieved, the European Union continues to be marked by enormous regional disparities in economic and social development, and there continues to be an asymmetry within the European Union between the peripheral regions – including the ultra-peripheral regions – and the centre. Accordingly, the impact of the Structural Funds has not been sufficient to correct the disparities in production between the richest and least developed areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I would like to express my support for Mr Nogueira Román's report, stressing by way of conclusion that remoteness and insularity, factors which are the hallmark of the ultra-peripheral regions, can be compensated for by developing activities financed by the Structural Funds with a view to increasing the competitiveness of the production chain, improving access to information and integrating these regions in the context of an enlarged European Union. This should accordingly reinforce the current cohesion policy, which is more necessary than ever to meet the challenges of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Female genital mutilation endangers health and leads to serious and irreversible consequences such as serious and potentially fatal complications in sexual relations, pregnancy and childbirth, and so it strikes me as essential that we vote for this report today and thereby condemn all female genital mutilation, to whatever degree it is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is all the more deserving of a favourable vote because it calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, to define all female genital mutilation as a crime and to impose criminal sanctions on any of their residents who have engaged in this practice, even if the offence was committed outside the EU's borders. This principle of the offence's extraterritoriality must be firmly upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">If any further proof of the need to vote for such a report were required, I shall give the following reason: the fact of being a victim of such practices, as well as that of being born a woman in a place where one runs the risk of undergoing genital mutilation must constitute valid and conclusive grounds for the right of asylum or of humanitarian protection to be granted. The Commission, the Council and the Member States must, within the framework of the immigration and asylum policy agreed in Title IV of the Amsterdam Treaty, adopt measures on granting residence permits to the victims of this practice and recognise the right to asylum of women and girls who risk being genitally mutilated.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of equality, liberty and dignity, to which every human being has a right, it appears to me – and should appear to us all – imperative that we protect women and vote unhesitatingly for this proposal. This is a political responsibility that we must shoulder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Female genital mutilation causes irreparable damage to health and can even lead to death. Any form of female genital mutilation, of whatever degree, is nothing other than an act of violence which constitutes a violation of the woman’s or girl’s fundamental rights, particularly the right to personal integrity and physical and mental health and of her sexual and reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Such violation and mutilation of a human being can under no circumstances be justified by respect for a religion such as Islam or by invoking traditional cultural practices or initiation ceremonies. Religious freedom and female genital mutilation have no connection with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Female genital mutilation is an assault on the rights of women and children as enshrined in several international conventions and is prohibited in the criminal legislation of the Member States. Moreover, it is in breach of the principles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

It is estimated that 15 per cent of this difference in pay is due to gender and not to other factors such as seniority, management responsibility and such like.

An extra effort must therefore be made to ensure that it is the job and the responsibilities, and not the individual’s gender, which decide how much he or she is paid. We support the report, which we believe contains a number of sensible recommendations. We wish to emphasise that, if unfair differences in pay are to be successfully stamped out, greater openness and transparency must be ensured in the way in which pay is determined. We also want to emphasise that individual countries must make sure they have reasonable conditions for women’s participation in the labour market (child care facilities etc), if the goal of equal pay for work of equal value is to be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even taking into account the structural differences between men and women in the labour market, such as age, training, occupation and career pattern, women's pay is still 15% lower, on average, than that of men, which can only be explained by value discrimination mechanisms. This is unacceptable. The issue of the wage discrimination which is practised against women in reality, and the underlying mechanisms, have been analysed in relative depth, although there are many shortcomings, in particular in statistical information for the European Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the rapporteur states, one thing is clear: this wage gap can only be reduced by means of a twin-track policy. This involves on the one hand attempting to improve women's position in the labour market, and on the other hand eliminating discrimination during the pay negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider it important that this issue should be treated as a top priority, including the Commission's proposal to launch a Europe-wide campaign on equal pay in 2002. But it is equally important that a proposal should be brought forward to revise and update the 1975 Equal Pay Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet as is always the case whenever it is a matter of justice for women in any walk of life, in implementing the principle of equal pay, the politicians are dragging their feet, as are the trade unions, unfortunately, which are still male-dominated organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women since 1975. We have action programmes and a Community framework strategy on gender equality. We have countless resolutions and guidelines. We have the Beijing Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in 1995. And now we have this report which – in view of the fact that the average wage gap between men and women in the EU still stands at almost 30% – is by no means unnecessary, for on women's issues in particular, we know that constant dripping wears away stone.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 17 recitals and 19 paragraphs contained in this resolution, which I support, we have put forward a great many sound and useful proposals designed to eliminate this wage gap, which continues even after retirement and especially affects women with lower pension provision, thus resulting in lifelong discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that action is required from the social partners in particular.

<p class="contents">As indicated in the report, according to a survey of 21 500 workers in the European Union carried out by the Dublin Foundation, 8% state that over the last 12 months they have been subject to bullying at work, which if extrapolated to the total workforce means that over 12 million workers are probably victims of this kind of situation throughout the 15 Member States. As the report warns us, although the true scale of this phenomenon is unknown, it is a serious problem in working life, and it is equally certain that the general increase in short-term contracts and insecurity of employment, especially among women, is creating conditions that encourage the practice of various forms of harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the measures proposed in the report for combating this phenomenon, including those for preventing it, those for increasing knowledge about it, exchanges of positive experience and the publication of a Green Paper by no later than March 2002, followed by an action programme of measures at Community level against bullying at work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has devastating effects on the physical and mental health of those – most frequently women – who are subjected to it. As the rapporteur has emphasised, these practices are due to "the growing number of short-term contracts and insecurity of employment." Combating harassment at work, therefore, involves restoring to each worker security of status, acceptable working conditions and a decent wage. All employees, however, need more rights within companies: the right to organised representation, the right to defend themselves and the right to social security benefits such as occupational health provision.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for uniform legislation specific to this issue to be put in place and applied consistently across all the EU Member States. At present, only France has legislated against harassment. It is, moreover, equally important to clarify the employer's responsibility in this area.

We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those whom they affect. That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone. It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU must only attend to those issues which it is best qualified to deal with, namely the cross-border issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Harassment at the workplace is, of course, a problem, and as much as possible must be done in various ways to do away with such harassment.

To be specific, it admits of omissions and oversights with respect to transparency and democratic control, violations even of the famous EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a lack of transparency on the role of Europol, the absence of information for the European Parliament etc. It is particularly revealing with regard to the Schengen Information System (that is, personal electronic records), in which 89% of personal information pertains to ‘unwanted’ persons. Documents which should be destroyed are used to supplement police records, data is kept on "persons whose identity has been usurped with no attempt to inform the legitimate older of the identity" and "there is a lack of clear criteria for entering data on the system, in particular in relation to unwanted aliens".</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the free movement of people is concerned, the report criticises England and Ireland for maintaining controls on internal borders and France for checking persons arriving from the Netherlands, due to the legislation of the surrounding countries (and especially Holland) on narcotics, but says not a word about the imposition of controls and the ban on allowing EU citizens to enter France or Sweden in order to take part in demonstrations in Nice and Gothenburg. However, Genoa provides the most representative picture of what Schengen means: on the one hand, the restriction on free movement with suffocatingly tight police controls and entry bans and, on the other, full – if not abusive – application of personal electronic records and police collaboration (Euro-police).</p>
<p class="contents">All this confirms that the Schengen Convention is a tool which is used to make it easier to carry out the job of pan-European suppression, make and monitor suspects and terrorise demonstrators. The situation is becoming even worse following the witch hunt unleashed by the USA with the help and forbearance of the ΕU on the pretext of the tragic events of 11 September. The aim is to silence every voice which speaks out against or even doubts their anti-grass roots policy, supposedly in the name of fighting ‘terrorism’.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals in the report are of a technocratic nature (more information for the European Parliament, Council approval for a binding legal framework to protect personal data, approval for the role of the Joint Supervisory Authority). However, they are accompanied by a proposal to introduce a Community information system, that is, a single computer network for data from the Schengen, Europol and Customs Use conventions in order to make personal electronic records even more efficient, again in the name of freedom, security and justice!</p>

To the question ‘Is this amorphous collection of Islamicists firmly established in Europe?’ Mrs Coninsx replied: "Europe can be a logistical fallback base for these terrorists. The Schengen area, in fact, makes the borders relatively easy to cross ".</p>
<p class="contents">This timely assessment of the situation may be added to, unfortunately, numerous others made over recent years in various fields, whether drug trafficking, the theft of works of art, illegal immigration, organised crime… One is all the more surprised when one reads the triumphalist report on the Schengen system, which has been laid before us today. For example, in the Council's introduction, we read: "thousands of travellers have crossed open borders unhindered, without security within the Schengen area suffering any visible detriment." One wonders whether the person who drew up the Council's report was perhaps suffering from hallucinations.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the report of the European Parliament not only repeats the same errors, but adds to them an order directed at the United Kingdom and at Ireland, which are invited to participate fully in Schengen and thus to completely abolish border controls on persons. This would, of course, be more practical for France, which would witness the dispersal of the tragic groups of illegal immigrants waiting in the north of the country to cross to Great Britain. It would not, however, resolve the fundamental question: how did these illegals manage to cross Europe and reach Calais without being seen? Does the Schengen system not bear an overwhelming responsibility for this?</p>
<p class="contents">The day after the terrorist attacks on the United States, we called for the EU to revise all its policies in order to prioritise citizens' security. We certainly heard some fine speeches against terrorism in this House yesterday, but today, we can clearly see the habitual drift starting again without any qualms at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Fortress Europe is shown day by day to be unjust and inhumane by the treatment meted out to immigrants in refugee centres, detention centres and other closed institutions. This Europe that Schengen has created is not democratic – as the rapporteur makes clear by putting the emphasis on the "major and serious shortcomings [which] have existed with regard to transparency and democratic control".
