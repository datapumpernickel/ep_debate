<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, thank you, but I am not the first to do so. Ms Thorning-Schmidt created the precedent not very long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with great pleasure that I am able at last to present these two reports, the general revision of the rules and a particular report which has been waiting even longer to be put on our agenda. I should like to comment mainly on the general amendment of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several reasons that compel us to revise our Rules and that are at the origin of this report. One is that we are facing enlargement and we will soon be a parliament of at least 732 Members. We must streamline our procedures and focus more on priorities if we are to function effectively as the democratic voice of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Nice Treaty, although not yet ratified, implies a certain number of specific changes which, if we vote for them today, will come into force as the Treaty of Nice, or equivalent provisions, come into force. We are not prejudicing the result of any national decision-taking procedure with regard to ratification of that Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there was the series of problems identified by the Bureau of Parliament in the report by Mr Provan, who is sitting just behind you ready to chair this debate, and a very appropriate chairman he will be.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has been drawn together in the committee's report and it is a package of nearly 120 specific changes to our Rules of Procedure. Over 80 of them are not controversial. There are, however, a few that are and I will focus my comments on just a few of those.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is a whole package of measures to try and streamline our procedures in plenary, to try to decongest plenary, especially at voting time, but also in general. That is the item that Members single out as being in need of reform, but it is very difficult to agree on reforms meeting with the necessary support. We have put forward a number of suggestions that non-controversial items, i.e. items that get a majority of more than 90% in committee, should be assumed to be non-controversial and go through plenary with a single vote – no amendments and no debate – unless there is a specific request to have a debate or to invite amendments. The burden of proof would be that way round.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for some own-initiative reports we should have the option of noting the report of the committee as it stands and forwarding it to the other institutions, without trying to redraft paragraph by paragraph in plenary in a drafting committee of over 600 members.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when he or she judges it useful, the President should be allowed to send reports which have attracted a very large number of amendments back to committee for the committee to act as a sort of filter and test which amendments have a measure of support and which do not. Those that are supported by less than one tenth of the members in committee would not need to be put to the vote in plenary because it is clear that they have no chance of being adopted. They will remain on paper, they will have been circulated and put on record but they need not detain the whole House with voting on them. That, along with several other minor measures which for reasons of time I will not go into, should decongest our plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose to scrap the topical and urgent procedure, not the subjects of course, these would be dealt with by other existing procedures or new procedures more appropriate to those subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">We also suggest changing the way we have our debates. Some Members are strongly in favour of switching to a "catch-the-eye" system as Mr Provan proposed, some strongly against. We have come up with a compromise: we start each debate, as now, with speakers from each group, maybe one or two or even three rounds of speakers, but allowing ourselves for the possibility of finishing with a "catch-the-eye" debate. That would enliven our proceedings. The same people might speak again in response to what has been said and no doubt Members who have stayed in the Chamber throughout the debate will catch the eye of the President and be able to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a reasonable and workable compromise. It conforms to what the Conference of Presidents said, because it has the word "may". It could be tried out for a period and if it does not work we can abandon it. If it does work we can continue. I would urge those in the House who are hesitating to give it a try. Why not try out something new? See if it works. Give us the chance to enliven our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I see it says seven minutes, but if you remember you interrupted me for at least two minutes at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will close with a short remark on my other report. I will not go through all the items in my own report. The other report was drafted at a time when we were facing accusations that our Rules discriminated against Members who do not belong to a political group. Our committee made an inventory of all the places in the Rules where you could imagine that might be the case or where it clearly is the case. We came up with possible remedies to each of those cases. Those will be put to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some that the House will judge are not necessary and we may have been over-zealous in our work. There are others the House will be able to approve. It is appropriate that the groups look at this. I know some have suddenly asked for more time. That is curious for a report that has been ready for a year and a half and has been envisaged for some time that it be taken in conjunction with this main report of mine, the general revision. I would regret it if it has to be referred back to committee. If necessary then fine, but it would be better to proceed and deal with this matter, recognising that further work on this is required at other levels besides the Rules of Procedure</p>
<p class="contents">I will stop now to allow myself some time to reply to the debate at the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must begin by congratulating Mr Corbett on the very comprehensive work that he has carried out in this wide-ranging review of the Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Inglewood report, like the second Corbett report, was prepared around two years ago because of initial internal inconsistencies in the Rules of this House, as then drafted, in respect of the justification of amendments. At that time it was thought it would be brought forward quite quickly, and then could be amended if necessary, as part of the more wide-ranging debate about the Rules we are currently engaged in. It did not happen. Indeed, it disappeared over the horizon more or less completely. I would just like to record my gratitude to the Fisheries Committee, which is not usually associated with these matters, for having, as far as I know, been the only other people involved in this Parliament, other than myself, and possibly Mr Corbett, who had appreciated it had not gone forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, what was originally intended to be a precursor to the general revision of the Rules is now seen as something running in parallel with them and, in fact, is substantively part of the overall package.</p>
<p class="contents">In simple terms, it is proposed that the question of whether or not amendments should be justified individually, calls for a single answer regardless of the context in which they are tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is suggested that a strict obligation to justify every amendment in this House does not really make sense. It is recognised that an individual justification can be helpful in the context of legislative procedures.</p>

<p class="contents">Not only will it make our lives easier by shortening our voting times, more importantly, it will make what we do in this House more transparent, more comprehensible to the outside world, because votes would focus on the key issues without taking away the right of minorities to express views.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on the issue of urgencies and the changes proposed by Mr Corbett, I know some Members are concerned at how human rights and topical and urgent items will be dealt with if the present procedure is abolished. What is proposed gives us a much better option. For human rights, the relevant committee – the Committee on Foreign Affairs – would bring forward a resolution on human rights. That means that human rights would be dealt with in exactly the same way as any other important issue in this House, in committee, in a considered manner, rather than rushed through on a Thursday afternoon in Strasbourg when very few Members are here. I hope that we in this House will support this very important proposal and work better on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been an MEP for four years and since I have been here there have been constant complaints that there are too many votes, we do not know what we are voting for, there are hundreds of amendments in plenary. If we want to change that, we have to vote on this report and vote for change. Unless we do, there will be no change, we will be back to the status quo and the complaints will continue.

These reports seem to codify nearly everything we have recently experienced in Parliament. They also contribute to the development of the European constitution. I believe that in this respect, we should not underestimate the importance of this matter as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has tabled fifteen amendments, not to this report, of course, but to the issue underlying this report. Ultimately, this is about one thing and one thing only: this Parliament mainly has a traditional power, namely a budgetary power. We, together with the Council, make up the budgetary authority. It strikes me time and again that many people do not always realise this. On occasions, they ask the Commission questions about issues on which we ourselves have to decide. This decision-making power also brings with it a certain responsibility which is expressed in two ways. Firstly, in the work of the committee itself, of course, but secondly, in the cooperation with the other committees. An important part of these amendments are about this cooperation with other committees. They aim to let this cooperation run as smoothly, efficiently and even-handedly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this, in turn, means that everyone who asks a question or makes a decision, must try to produce a financial memorandum, so that they have an insight into the financial side and can thus give substance to our extremely important competence in the field of finances. A competence which we hope will be extended to include areas where it does not exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to say that fourteen committees submitted opinions, so just reading all that and sorting through it was a great labour, Mr Corbett. Many congratulations on your achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control worked on two issues. One has to do with the Court of Auditors, and you have taken it on board in its entirety, notably the appointment of the Court's members as carried out by us in the committee and in plenary, which has been customary ever since Mr Lamassoure and Mr Bourlanges produced their reports in 1992 and 1995 respectively. For the sake of the rules' clarity, that now has to be firmly established.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue has to do with OLAF, and gave rise to much controversy as to how members should be treated by OLAF or should act in regard to it. At the time, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control had delivered an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which, however, found its way into plenary by another route. Our opinion was thus dropped at the time. This then resulted in a complaint. I think that now the time has come when we can consistently and properly put members in such a position as regards how they deal with OLAF and act in relation to it, that they are not lumped together with the administration. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has now tabled an amendment on this, and I wish to support it. In the final analysis, it covers the amendment by the Committee on Budgetary Control which you have been unable to deal with in your report. I would be happy if we could vote for it, and then we would no longer need the complaint and the appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is exactly what we need, a momentum behind the reform so that we achieve it rather than just talking about it. I hope that the entire House will support the compromise amendments that he has agreed with various groups within the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the amendments the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms placed before the committee responsible did not receive universal support. Nonetheless we were dealing with the Member States' possibility of making legislative proposals under Article 67 of the EC Treaty and the developments and gaps in that practice. We are similarly looking at the category of amendments that relate to responsibility of the committee in relation to the respect for fundamental rights in the EU. Although, as I said, our opinion was not carried in its entirety, I nonetheless will support and will urge others to support, the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a note of caution, this revision does not refer to the interinstitutional agreement on confidential information and sensitive documents, known as the Brok Agreement, which is still under negotiation with the Council. I must urge the House to think very carefully before accepting the so-called Brok Framework Agreement, because it puts Parliament at a great disadvantage compared to any of the other institutions. It actually gives ordinary members of the public a greater right of access to sensitive documents in that any request must be duly considered. Under these proposals, Parliament is in an imbalanced situation in that we have no right to initiate access to confidential documents. With those caveats and those warnings, I urge the House to totally support the rapporteur's proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it can also help to consolidate plenary's political image. It is therefore very important to steer clear of every tendency to make plenary's work bureaucratic.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome the incorporation of proposals for dialogue with the European Central Bank and also those on the economic policy guidelines. In this context, I would like to emphasise that relationships between the institutions change over a certain period of time. We really do have to change the nature of these relationships and fill them with new life over and over again. This should be a general characteristic of future debates on the Rules of Procedure; these debates should not be matters of no consequence, but should make it clear that, in this Parliament of ours, rules are not made as ends in themselves but, on the one hand, they are made in order to improve the quality of the work done and to tighten up working procedures and give them more focus and, on the other hand, in order to bring to light those essential aspects that are important for enhancing Parliament's political standing in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that I have to touch on something which, in my view, the rapporteurs and we as plenary have to reconsider. I consider Amendment No 59 to Article 110a to be problematic. I can see the justified concern to do everything possible to really get the right and important political debates conducted in plenary, but not all debates on foreign or security policy are, by definition, of greater value than, for example, the issues that are brought to a conclusion in the specialist committees, because it has become clear that only a huge majority can prepare the way for a second reading and for success in a contest with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules must not lead to a situation in which, at the conclusion of a debate in a committee, we organise non-existent pseudo-majorities to vote against a report in order to comply with the formal requirements for getting it debated in plenary. I really would consider that an avoidable piece of bureaucracy. Perhaps the rapporteurs will come up with a better selection procedure and thus enable us to reach agreement this week. I really do think it important that this amendment should not be adopted in the form proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask the rapporteur to clarify what he expects Parliament and the committees to do with Amendments Nos 87 and 88, as we are not an executive, for which farthings or pennies or cents and …</p>

I know just how laborious that is, and so my thanks and congratulations to Mr Corbett are all the more heartfelt.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a general comment before I deal with three points raised by the Committee on Legal Affairs. The objective of strengthening plenary and having the great political debates carried on here is a good one, but if you want to do that, you have to give the committees greater responsibility. That is possible only if you raise the hurdles on the route from committee to plenary. That is absolutely imperative. What Mr Corbett and the committee are proposing is going in the right direction. Perhaps we will have to go a little further in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There were, and are, three points of importance to the Committee on Legal Affairs. The first is legislative initiatives. Outside, we call for Parliament to have the right to initiate legislation, a right which we have only in a very limited form. The obstacles put in our way by Parliament itself are quite appalling. To take just one example, an initiative by me on discrimination in legal aid was stuck in the Conference of Committee Chairmen for many, many months. These are the obstacles you have to demolish.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point has to do with the votes to confirm the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole. Here, the procedures in the Member States are utterly different. In Parliament's present position, I consider a secret ballot rather than a roll call to be, in both instances, a very important safeguard for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I concur with what has been said about OLAF. A large number in my group will give it their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this report on the general revision of the Rules of Procedure, the rapporteur puts forward proposals<span class="italic"> </span>that would enable us to simplify procedures and to focus parliamentary work on legislation and on topical and important political debates.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I highlighted some issues that seek, in some way, to optimise the performance of this institution. These issues are: with regard to Question Time, the President of the sitting should have the option of referring questions for Question Time to the committee responsible, which would have the advantage of freeing up time in plenary for debates. It is also important that, under the open method of coordination, the European Parliament should not run the risk of being excluded from the debate on issues of the utmost importance. Hence, the proposal that I put forward in my opinion seeks to refer the decision on the process to be followed to the committee responsible, which may then propose that a report be drawn up. Another aspect that should not be overlooked – although it has been – is that the committee responsible may decide, in the light of reports and annual reports of the Council and the Commission, to request individual members of the Council to appear before the committee to answer questions. The purpose of this would be, once again, to increase the European Parliament’s influence under the open method of coordination, thereby making it more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to highlight the close relationship that exists between lifelong learning and the issues that fall within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which would make it logical to include this matter amongst the competences of that parliamentary committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament must become the Centre Court of European debate. That is our ambition, but on its own it is of course not enough for us to want it; we also have to adapt our ways of operating accordingly. That, I think, is at the heart of the report that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has adopted. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly supports this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to thank Mr Corbett most warmly for the multitude of ideas he has elaborated here, which will carry us further forward. We wish to thank him for his meticulous work on highly complex legal material. We also wish to thank him for his exemplary cooperation and frankness, which have been a hallmark of this consultation process, which has gone on for a year and a half already.</p>
<p class="contents">We want our work to become more political, for us to concentrate on the essentials, and we also want to organise it in a more responsible way. We want the current affairs debate, which is soon to be introduced, to make us more political. It is quite extraordinary that we have to make use of instrumental crowbars in order to get a current issue into this honourable House. We have to demand statements by the Commission or the Council in order to be able to express ourselves on the burning political issues of the day. One consequence of that is that the spectacle the European summits provide continues to get more attention than the decisions reached in this Parliament of ours. We need changes to our Rules of Procedure in order to achieve better balance in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to work in a more concentrated way. We need to do without time-consuming routine resolutions, even though many Members have become attached to them. We need a simplified procedure for uncontroversial reports in order to be able to concentrate on our legislative work. We in this House are all aware that by now some 80% of European legislation needs Parliament's consent, but I doubt whether more than half of our time in plenary session is spent on legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also do something about working in a somewhat more responsible manner once our decisions have acquired legal effect and become something more than just demands and resolutions. That is why the proposal is rightly made to give the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market greater responsibility for compatibility with the Budget and with the law. There is no point in us making demands that cannot come to anything due to financial considerations or the absence of any basis in law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, we want to safeguard the rights of individual MEPs and those of the groups. It goes without saying that Members of this Parliament must have the right to speak here in their mother tongue, and that the groups must be entitled to put motions, but the prospect of eastward enlargement and the need to prevent this House being fragmented requires us to tighten up somewhat the conditions for the formation of groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may mention my personal view, individual arrangements for bringing texts into plenary without them being discussed in committee have to be restricted, in order to enable them to be better prepared, and we have to limit them to really urgent cases. I say this with particular reference to the matters for urgent debate, which have recently developed into a procedure in which a relatively small number of Members are able to pass Parliamentary resolutions at a point when most of us are already on our way home.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure has to guarantee that as many Members as are able attend the group and committee discussions. Exceptions should be permitted only in cases of real urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports changes in this House that improve the way we work, making us more political, more visible and the European Union more democratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A real parliament, in other words. Needless to say, we as Parliament still too often lack powers. In defence, migration, agriculture and in other areas too, and this is what the fight in the Convention about the future of Europe is about. At the moment, the European Commission and Council are often too technocratic in this respect too. They drag us down into detail and thus conceal the real political choices. These are subsequently brought to us in an ambiguous format which, in turn, has a negative bearing on their appeal to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we as Parliament should be given a temporary foot and mouth inquiry committee, modelled on the BSE inquiry committee. These are ways in which we can turn into a tiger rather than a toothless lamb. Every parliamentary committee can already develop activities in order to become more powerful, and we actually want to gain a more solid position as Parliament, much like the American Congress and the Senate.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are, in fact, tackling a component, an important component in which tradition, technocracy and – unfortunately – conservatism have hampered us too much in order to become a more political and more interesting parliament. Nowadays, we often have a list, sometimes in the form of insulting one-minute statements, which make a mockery of the parliamentary debates. The most insulting of all must be that the Commission and the Council sometimes take up three times as much speaking time as all the group leaders combined. I would ask the Commission and the Council at this stage to adopt more stringent restrictions of their own volition. Subsequently, we ourselves must limit the number of speakers on behalf of the group. We must liven up the debate here and there by using the catch-the-eye principle. This principle should not be used for empty talk, but exactly allow those who have already spoken to take the floor again, so that a true dialogue can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the point of urgent debates. I have the honour of coordinating the urgent resolutions on behalf of the PSE Group. This is often a disgrace in my view. The groundwork is far too cursory and judgment is passed on all manner of things without the specialist committees being involved. I recognise that human rights can warrant a resolution and be of value to a government or country involved. These, however, should be prepared thoroughly and be closely monitored, even following adoption, and be given a sound follow-up. My group supports the idea of the human rights/NGO community and in this respect, has asked Pat Cox and yourselves to set up a parliamentary committee with a wide remit, much like the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, at the earliest opportunity. In that case, the urgent debates can be abolished and we will gain a far better and more credible perspective. I am interested to hear the reactions to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett has done a considerable amount of work and made compromises in order to reach a common position. With this, Parliament has searched its own conscience. We as Parliament, would, pending the forthcoming enlargement by 10 to 12 new Member States, ask for frequent reforms of all European institutions, including the Council and the Commission. This is also required as a matter of urgency. However, we should not at the same time be frightened about carrying out reforms that are desperately needed ourselves. We should admit that the previous reforms of the European Parliament have achieved precious little. They can be summed up as much ado about nothing. This is because individual interests, interests of smaller groups, one-sided interests and ever tighter legislation, time and again, result in voting on hundreds of amendments, split votes and roll-call votes. Mr Corbett has made a valiant effort in all these areas and has sought to compromise. However, the self-same interests are threatening to undermine the whole show again. I call on all fellow MEPs to serve the total interest of our Parliament’s democratic politics and not to remain focused on one-sided interests. Indeed, by voting on the Corbett report with a majority, we should demonstrate that we are up to the task, and the fruits should be a little more significant this time. Parliament should have the courage to shrug off its past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reform package that we have before us is not revolutionary, but it amounts to a sensible and incremental change which will contribute towards making this Parliament far more mature, efficient and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the conservatism that is sometimes displayed by representatives of the PPE and PSE Groups on this question will not, at this late stage, hinder the drive towards reform. That would be an incredibly poor signal to send out to the Convention and would seriously weaken the standing of our parliamentary delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group puts great stress on trying to make plenary sessions livelier. That is why we propose an amendment to make the "catch-the-eye" procedure mandatory rather than voluntary, along with another amendment to ensure that it is practical to interrupt speakers without penalising their speaking time. We need more drama in this place, more critical exchanges and a better balance between the necessary privileges of the party groups and the rights of individual members to express themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group was quick to express great doubts about the need for revision of the Rules of Procedure which goes beyond the reforms necessary after Nice, and we raised sincere objections to the method which has changed this report from a report introducing minor changes to a report based on Mr Corbett’s creativity more than a genuine need. Indeed, I would remind you by way of context that very many of the reforms which he himself, moreoever, has introduced in past years have not been implemented, notably the legislation on the Commission’s powers. Mindful of this, we have worked quickly to avoid any of his main proposals subsequently being adopted by the House. We will see what happens tomorrow. Indeed, I defy anybody, Mr President, to predict what will happen during the vote tomorrow as things stand, for these reforms are, as I said, extremely wide-ranging and incoherent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise two very brief points if I may, Mr President. First of all, we objected strongly to the idea of a quantitative rather than a qualitative approach, deciding what to deal with in plenary and what to refer back to committee purely on the basis of the number of amendments or the number of votes cast for and against.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth of the matter, as things stand in Parliament, is that all those lengthy, tedious voting sessions are essentially the result of poor preparation in committee. The committees that do their work properly are those which are able, under the current system, to keep voting time to a minimum and to put just a few genuinely important points to the vote in plenary; those which do not succeed in doing this are precisely those committees which cause us to waste time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are extremely sceptical as regards the option of referring reports back to committee, of letting the committees make the decisions in the cases stipulated by the Corbett report. We are concerned for the simple reason that Parliamentary committees do not always reflect the views of the majority of Parliament, and we would be in very great danger of ending up with conflicting resolutions with conflicting content.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to have said a lot more but my time is running out. I would, in any case, like to thank Mr Corbett for his work – despite the fact that he has not listened to most of my speech! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been discussing for over a year now how our work in Parliament can be made more efficient and more lively. The commitment Mr Corbett has shown, both in committee and together with other Members of this House, to bringing about changes in this area is indeed admirable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is proposed in the report that Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure should be amended by the abolition of debates on topical and urgent subjects and the insertion of new rules introducing such things as a special debate on highly topical events, especially of a political nature. Such a special debate would be decided on at the beginning of each part-session on Monday afternoon. Although there is much to be said for this proposal, my group would prefer us to stick with the present rule.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so? The main argument against the innovation is that the special debate would not result in anything. It is not, in our view, acceptable to do without a vote in plenary on the issue in question, above all because our debates on matters of topical and urgent importance have hitherto seen us pass resolutions which express positions especially on human rights violations, which give significant support and encouragement to many who campaign for democracy and human rights in the countries in question. No, my group does not want us to let this important political tool fall from our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Procedural matters are not just binding rules for our work together, but also have to do with power. This makes it all too understandable that small groups subject every paragraph to the minutest examination under the magnifying glass. The Rules of Procedure must ensure that groups are treated equally and must not limit small groups' parliamentary opportunities. I take these premises as my starting point in rejecting, on behalf of my group, the report's proposed amendment to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure, which amendment provides that, in future, groups will not be able to introduce amendments into plenary on their own; only two groups acting jointly, or 32 Members, will be able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has two snags. One is that it is not evident why 32 MEPs should have more rights than a political group. The other is that we consider it to be a group's legitimate parliamentary right to table amendments to be voted on in plenary. It goes without saying that amendments express the groups' political will. As for the argument presented by Mr van den Berg, that small groups' amendments have no chance anyway and that they get in the way of voting, I do not believe that that holds water.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee, I moved that the Rules of Procedure should be framed in gender-neutral language, and Mr Corbett agreed with this. That had not been done the last time, for some reason or other. I hope that something can now be done about this in cooperation with the services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bonde (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, all MEPs are entitled to be treated equally, whether they are part of a large political group or are here as sole representatives of a group of electors. Our task is to ensure equality among elected representatives and a situation in which we all have the same opportunities to be active in Parliament. The political groups constitute a practical arrangement for giving MEPs the opportunity to work in conjunction with more or less like-minded people. A political group cannot have special rights to which MEPs outside the groups do not also have access. Otherwise, we should not be equal under the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of equality applies everywhere in the EU, including in this Parliament. I am pleased that this was expressly stated by the Court of Justice in the grounds of the judgment whereby the Technical Group was disbanded because it expressly stated that it did not want to be a political group. The judgment requires Parliament to go through the various arrangements for MEPs and ensure that no discrimination takes place against those MEPs who do not form part of a group. By implying in its judgment that MEPs who are nonetheless discriminated against are welcome to initiate new legal proceedings, the Court is doubtless concerned to ensure that the principle of equality is observed to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">The Corbett report is not a response to the Court’s judgment. It contains a long list of proposals designed to strengthen the groups, and it will also make it more difficult to form new political groups. In future, at least 16 MEPs from a fifth of the Member States will be needed to form a group. That is the compromise forced through by the large groups. I have doubts about both the wisdom and the legality of this restriction, which might lead to the regionalists still perhaps being without their own group and to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance perhaps having no group following the next elections. Whether one agrees or disagrees with the regionalists, they nonetheless have a common programme and are part of a common, supranational federation of parties in the form of the European Free Alliance. There are not enough of them to form their own group, but should they not be entitled to act as an independent political entity if they wish to do so? The Greens were also such an entity before there were enough of them to form a political group. Are we to lose a green group in Parliament because the Greens do not have sufficient support in an enlarged EU or because, following an election in Germany, they are perhaps back in a situation in which they have less than the minimum percentage of the votes which, undemocratically, is required of them if they are to be represented in Parliament. Alternatively, take the Italian radicals who, with their international radical party, are registered with the UN and who have a Belgian representative on their list. Can the seven Italian radicals be deprived of their equal political status with other groupings?</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are obliged to ensure that all those who cannot form an independent political group are able to have their proportionate rights recognised in the Rules of Procedure and by means of practical and pragmatic arrangements which guarantee genuine equal status. If a political group is entitled to have proposals placed on the agenda on every occasion, that same entitlement could be given to smaller groupings in turn. If a political group is entitled to table an endless number of proposals, MEPs outside the groups should be allowed, at least once in a while, to table a proposal and have it debated and put to the vote. If a political group is entitled to a certain budget and number of staff, MEPs outside the groups should be guaranteed their proportionate share of such a budget and number of staff.</p>
<p class="contents">A democracy is to be recognised by the way in which it treats its minorities. We are not fair to our minorities at present. We should give them the same rights enjoyed by those of us who have been fortunate enough to have a sufficient number of MEPs to form political groups. Why not give MEPs outside the groups the right to form a technical group so that they themselves are able to administer a mutual distribution of the rights due to a group. What we need is Corbett 2, giving individual MEPs their full rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the report seeks to give new powers to the European Parliament that the Treaty does not confer on it; this is particularly the case in draft Amendments Nos 14, 29, 33, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53 and 56. In Amendment No 56 for example, the European Parliament takes upon itself the right to call on the Council to implement Article 7 of the TEU on possible breaches of human rights. Yet, as you know, and as the European Court of Justice has already reiterated, the European Parliament cannot proceed in this manner, as it is not an assembly with full sovereign powers. Parliament only possesses the powers that are specifically conferred on it by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second guideline we do not support is that, in order to enter into force, many of the draft amendments assume that the Treaty of Nice will be ratified. Whether or not it will be ratified remains open to question. This is illustrated, for example, by draft Amendments Nos 8, 9, 41 and 58. Of course, you will say to me that if the Treaty of Nice is not subsequently ratified, these amendments will not enter into force and there will be no legal problems. I feel, however, that there is a problem of political behaviour: our prior approval of these amendments would be a clear dismissal of the views of the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third unacceptable guideline is that the report reveals a certain inclination on the part of Parliament to silence minority groups, something that Mr Corbett kindly described earlier as ‘simplifying procedures’. This regrettable inclination can be seen in particular in draft Amendments Nos 6, 59, 63, 68, 74, 85 and 101. Draft Amendment No 59, in particular, makes it more difficult for minority groups to table amendments to a text in plenary if they have not gained more than 10% of the votes in committee. And everything is in keeping with this. It is obvious, Mr President, this report, in our opinion, is not fit to be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, however, is no reason not to thank him for the huge amount of work he has done on the general report and reiterate the comments made earlier by my Group Coordinator, Mr Wuemerling.</p>
<p class="contents">As time is short, I would like to specify that the second Corbett report discusses the fact that Parliament will continue to operate on the basis of political groups, or, where appropriate, these political groups will be supplemented by purely functional parliamentary groups composed of Non-attached Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Group of the European People’s Party has been extremely clear from the start. We would like a parliament composed of political groups, which were the embryos that became the European political parties and will continue to be their driving force. The European Parliament is not a technical body, but rather a political assembly in which political decisions are taken, and the citizens have the right to know the political positions of the people making those decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Choosing political groups over technical groups is the most transparent option. This does not mean reducing the rights of Members who do not want to join a group due to their political affinities. Individual MEPs, whether or not they are part of a group, have the same rights as Members. It would be something else altogether to give groups special rights which will not, of course, be granted to those who are not part of the existing groups, but the difference between the rights of a group and the rights of a Member must be made very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Corbett report has two objectives: first, to clarify that when MEPs decide to form a group, Parliament accepts their political affinity as a given, unless it is expressly denied; secondly, to increase the participation of Non-attached Members in the Conference of Presidents and the preparatory meetings. It thereby reinforces the rights of Non-attached Members without needing to introduce an artificial mixed group that would be a group only in name.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore calling for the Corbett report to be adopted, with the exception of the second point of the Resolution, which refers to the Sessional Service, as I do not think it fair to impose a responsibility on this Service that, in any case, should be that of the political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why fix something that is not broken? I have to disagree with you on that point, Mrs Frassoni. There is in fact something dysfunctional here in Parliament, and it is the process of debate which, for far too long, has been far too predictable and therefore quite boring as well. MEPs enter in turn and read out their two-minute speeches, and the result is Parliament in which there is in actual fact no proper lively debate. We do not give people the opportunity to see a parliament in which there is a real conflict of opinions, and that is of course a pity, for we do in fact have a parliament in which, in the committees, we have quite lively and spontaneous debates. People just do not get to see that, however. The Corbett report tries to create a basis for a more lively debate and, clearly, it is very negative to object to this 'catch-the-eye' procedure. One thing is certain, however, and that is that, if we ourselves do not try to do something, nothing will happen. I therefore think that we need to put the lid on this tendency simply to continue in our old ways. It is also excellent that we are now being given the opportunity to distinguish between what is important or controversial and what is not controversial. That too will result in people’s being presented with a livelier Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying a couple of words about the amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. With the Treaty of Amsterdam, we arranged, as you know, for a new procedure – the open coordination method, beginning with employment policy – to be introduced. What those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed was simply that Parliament’s role should be established in the light of this method. The result would be more openness and more focus on this procedure. It would also mean more democratic control in the framework of the open coordination method. It is therefore very annoying that this knowledge or insight has not made much of an impression upon the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has not appreciated that it was important in this area too, which is quite new and of great relevance to the EU, to try to make democratic progress. I would thank Mr Corbett for an outstanding report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Chamber is often packed, even though more people often attend the committee meetings. The voting and the preparatory work can be followed on the Internet, and hundreds of thousands of visitors to the locations in Strasbourg and Brussels get a sense of how the work proceeds.</p>
<p class="contents">On quite a few occasions, I have seen sceptical seventeen year-olds put the headphones on and be fascinated by the fact that it is in actual fact possible to conduct a debate in different languages. There is a change in attitude on the part of these seventeen year-olds. I believe it would be good for the legitimacy of the EU if all school pupils were to have the opportunity to visit us.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be proud of this openness, even if there is room for a number of improvements, which are also under way. Once people have ceased to be fascinated by Parliament’s openness, it is not however always easy to understand how we work. The voting goes on forever, with sometimes hundreds of amendments. Instead of a vigorous debate in the Chamber, with quick responses and opposition, we have a series of long monologues in which we read out our papers written in advance, as I am doing today. Sometimes, the Chamber is all but empty, in spite of the fact that interesting issues are being debated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is partly due to the fact that we speak different languages. We can, however, do more to reform the work of Parliament. Our president is helping with this by ensuring that we table political proposals and, with Mr Corbett’s report, we are taking quite a few very significant steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague, Mr Duff, said, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr Corbett’s work and his efforts to simplify and tighten up the procedures and make them more focused. These are very important changes, and I hope they may be accompanied by a desire to be more alert in making use of the Rules of Procedure than we have been previously. On certain issues, there is of course great creativity when it comes to using the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to take still further steps with a view to obtaining more lively debates and disposing of more issues that come before the European Parliament. Proposals were tabled earlier for creating a type of technical committee. Perhaps we can return to that subject at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we completely satisfied with the proposal for dealing with urgent cases, and we have therefore proposed a compromise in order to highlight these issues. As Mrs Kaufmann indicated, we are carrying out important work on human rights which has resonance far beyond the walls of this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall certainly have the opportunity to make new changes and to take a step further, especially following enlargement when, presumably, both the Chamber and the political groups will be more heterogeneous than before. It is therefore a question of finding a balance between efficiency and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest changes required if the European Parliament is to operate entirely democratically, responsibly and satisfactorily depend upon treaty changes, and we are unable to do much on that score in the present situation. It is a question of introducing the right of co-decision on a greater number of issues, of getting rid of the peculiar way of dividing up the budget and of dealing with the matter of travel between Strasbourg and Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">These are issues we can perhaps solve in the Convention. For the time being, Mr Corbett’s work is a major step forward for us, and I really wish to congratulate him on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope you will forgive me for sharing my concerns with you nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes a parliament a parliament is, of course, the debate of the people present in heart and spirit and who represent the opinion of their own rank and file. People who, despite their different backgrounds, still try to reach consensus and settle any differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is the source of this tendency to obstruct specifically small groups, give small Member States less say and eliminate minority languages? I fail to see the connection. I cannot appreciate how organising everything in large groups will liven up the parliamentary debate. I rather think that the opposite is likely. I can see a move towards very large groups, whose internal diversity I am struck by, so that I actually regret every instance where the membership of individual MEPs is curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we can modernise Parliament without having to put up with these disadvantages. But I regret the fact that the admissibility of amendments will from here on in depend on the number of members in a committee. Surely this has nothing to do with the ideas we are trying to put across! I fail to comprehend how speakers from different backgrounds could bring universal happiness. Non-European thinking is the very thing which is, in fact, threatening Europe. It is important for different Member States to have their say, as was enshrined in the previous Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you another example: the formation of groups. Needless to say, this has led to a great deal of commotion, and I know that Mr Corbett has met us some of the way. He will say he has met us most of the way. I too have started making regular visits to the candidate countries, and just imagine how difficult it will be for smaller groups, and more recent groups, to enter this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the language issue. It is, of course, important for us to be able to talk in our native tongues, but it is just as important for all citizens also to be able to hear their language in the gallery …</p>

An attempt to boost the bipartite model and marginalise everyone else, especially the political thorns in Parliament's side.</p>
<p class="contents">Members have already lost the right to table individual amendments, motions and proposals to plenary. Now there is a motion to abolish the urgent and topical procedure, to make it even harder to set up political groups, to extend the system of voting on reports without debate in plenary, to prevent small groups from tabling amendments which garner less than 10% of the vote in committee and to prevent groups from tabling amendments which...</p>

<p class="contents">His task was to simplify Parliament’s work and make it more transparent, not least in order to make it easier for public opinion, for the general public to understand. And the result? Mr Corbett is seeking to abolish topical and urgent debates, which are one of Parliament’s most effective ways of expressing itself and making its voice heard throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the procedures, the Corbett report introduces casuistry worthy of the Sacred Roman Rota in the best Jesuit tradition – no offence to the Jesuits. Thus, an amendment tabled in plenary may not ever reach plenary session, a report intended for plenary may not ever reach it either, and the procedures laid down for each report are in danger of being distorted with each successive committee meeting, as the previous speakers have said, on the basis of majorities which may or may not change.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to all this, the idea seems to be, Mr President – to misquote George Orwell – that all groups are equal but some groups are more equal than others, and, in any case, the individual Members do not count for anything.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, with regard to the general revision of the Rules of Procedure, through which<span class="bold"> </span>Mr Corbett is seeking, not least, to introduce the concept of a form of ongoing dialogue on reform, the Italian radicals call for the majority of Mr Corbett’s proposals to be rejected on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other Corbett report, Mr President, we have been waiting and calling for two years for this House to get round to adopting a position on the treatment reserved by our Rules of Procedure for the Non-attached Members. The seven Members of the Bonino List, the seven radical Members, for instance, elected by over two and a half million Italian citizens, have not been able to table even a single amendment to the Corbett report purely on our own behalf, such that we have had to ask two group chairman to grant us the favour of – symbolically – allowing us to table symbolic amendments together with them – and I would like to thank them for this. I am saying this to illustrate the fact that, as individual Members, we have not been able to table even a single amendment on the report which will decide our fate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the judgment of the Court of First Instance which disbanded the Technical Group of Independent Members, nine discriminatory conditions were imposed. We see the Corbett report – the second report, I mean – as a hesitant step towards resolving matters and, naturally, in this regard, we feel that the best solution would be to set up a mixed group. Thanks to the kindness of one of the groups, we have been able to table an amendment to this effect which we hope the House will adopt. We feel that it would be an initial step towards better definition of the necessary balance of relationships between the individual rights of the Members of the European Parliament and respect for national political balances and for the groups in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that this evening’s debate confirms the need for us to change the way we work in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A full spectrum of positions have been expressed on Mr Corbett’s report, from opposition to support, veiled criticism and open criticism. This evening’s debate confirms this. Our political family – and this is the first time I have been in this situation – is going to hold a last, lengthy debate tomorrow to decide our final position on the voting list.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to focus on the method. The Rules of Procedure are a secondary rather than a primary point of reference. Therefore, we are currently witnessing a period of great change in our institutional architecture. We have two years to decide whether we have made the right changes to our Rules of Procedure or whether further changes need to be made. At the end of the Convention’s work, we will certainly have to compare our work on the Rules of Procedure with the decisions taken on the legislative procedures. We must therefore have confidence, above all in ourselves, and decide to experiment with new ways of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have to say that, apart from the issue of topical and urgent debates, I do feel that there are problems, and the Corbett report certainly proposes a number of solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His aim is to improve how Parliament works, to couple efficiency with democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett is today proposing that we anticipate the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. No one, in my view, can criticise us for doing so, since, realistically speaking, the provisions that Mr Corbett is proposing should enter into force at the same time as the Treaty. This solution seems to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also imagine that we will be needing Mr Corbett again in the future because, as Mr Fiori said, it seems that, in the light of the European Union’s agenda, whether this tackles the Convention or enlargement, the Rules of Procedure will again have to be amended in several respects. I shall only discuss two aspects, namely the monitoring of subsidiarity and comitology. The results of the Convention in these areas will obviously need to be included in a new set of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to various points made in the Corbett report. First of all, it discusses taking into account the nature of a convention, how to appoint its members and how to establish its mandate. I think that this shows how our Rules of Procedure can be adapted, which is something that I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the report puts across the idea that the European Parliament must involve the national parliaments in drawing up the broad political and economic guidelines. This is an essential element which we approve through the Rules of Procedure, and I welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, like my fellow Member, Mrs Kauffmann, I would also like to draw the attention of our rapporteur to the issue of gender neutrality. I already touched upon this issue in plenary earlier and, in the context of the report, I would like to reiterate what I said. From now on, we must speak of ‘the rights of the individual’, and whilst quickly leafing through Mr Corbett’s report, I unfortunately noticed that, despite vigilant efforts on both sides, some mistakes have still slipped through the net. For example, the French version of Amendment No 51 in Article 104(a) still speaks of the<span class="italic"> ‘droits de l’homme</span>’ (literally, ‘rights of man’). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first criticism concerns the matters for urgent and topical debate, something with which I have dealt for years in this House. I have observed no lack of serious and sound work done in this area as compared with any other, and I note that assertions are being made about the matters for urgent and topical debate mainly by Members who have never done any work on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of the successes I achieved as a parliamentarian through motions on matters of urgency, helping to actually free people from wrongful imprisonment and eliminate serious violations of human rights within a matter of days, and I could call any number of witnesses to confirm this to you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore my opinion that we can introduce an additional current affairs hour; I have nothing against that. It goes without saying that we can also focus matters of urgent and topical debate more on human rights, but, as for the monthly urgent matters procedure with at least five subjects – usually between ten and fifteen are submitted, and it is only with difficulty that we can agree on five of them – that should be kept. It has proved its worth, and the results it has achieved are among this House's truly great highlights which do it such great credit.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish furthermore to take a stand against all the motions that seek to limit the less widely spoken languages or the smaller groups, to make this House bureaucratic and centralised. To take just one small example, we are no longer to be able to express our solidarity with other Members using a lesser used language when they object to their motion not being available in it. We will have Member States which will find it difficult to get the requisite twelve Members together. I also protest as a representative of a major language…</p>

Is what is going on here in plenary ‘As You Like It’? Is it even ‘What You Will’? Surely not. That is why we want to alter our Rules of Procedure, but we do not really dare to. We will just go a little bit in the direction we have to go in, at a time when it is no longer great industrial armies, hosts of workers, or political parties' foot soldiers that count, but networks, connections and the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">We had to have Rules of Procedure in which individuals had as many rights as possible. They do not. Yet Mr Corbett is a bit daring, for he knows the Rules of Procedure inside out, or rather, he is allowed to take the risk. Well done! What we do not yet, though, trust ourselves to have, is an open debate. Why not? What are we ourselves afraid of? Of people actually watching us? Of them no longer seeing themselves as masochists, but rather really experiencing here what they learn at school, what democracy would mean if it were lived out? It cannot be that. But we can work at it, and that is why what we are debating here at the moment is as important as changes to the offside rule in football. This is an abstract debate behind closed doors, now being played out again briefly by a number of Members, but with very wide-ranging effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that we should support the attempt, at least, at considering how we can allow debates to be held which have an effect on the public and in which individual MEPs have rights too. If we were to carry on that way, it would also mean that ‘All's Well That Ends Well’. That too is a play by Shakespeare, which he wrote in 1601. If you are a sceptic, you look to 1610, when only the tempest is left. Is that what you want? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first, which the speakers before me have already touched on, is that citizens' parliaments stand for openness and therefore public accessibility, for democratic legitimacy, comprehensive controls, and lawmaking, for the exchange of opinions and competing ideas, for information and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Rules of Procedure serve to shape our procedures in such a way that we can perform our duties. Not only do we have to regulate our procedures, but we also have to acquire the competences to do justice to the demands made of us. As I see it, this may well be about the Rules of Procedure, but, in a parliamentary democracy founded on party democracy and thus also on parliamentarianism dominated by political groups, it is about the balance and interaction of work in committees, in the groups and in plenary. It is about the interaction of electoral law, the statute for MEPs, about having the same rules on incompatibility and about what we are doing here, because we may well be able to have common rules, but different presuppositions lead to different ways of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the strengthening of the legislative procedures and of legislative debate, not at the expense of parliamentary control and political discourse, but in a balanced fashion. I therefore agree completely with Mrs Randzio-Plath's view that we have to be careful that a large majority in committee does not result in diminished debate in plenary, as we will otherwise be impairing the creation of a broad majority and putting on a sham debate beforehand.</p>

In that respect I agree with them that we could have made many good and necessary improvements to this House’s procedures even based on the current Rules of Procedure, but these are not the only improvements we are making. I have reached the conclusion that is better to change this system in such a democratic process as this, which the reports of both Mr Corbett and Lord Inglewood symbolise. It is the only way of bringing some sparkle and life to the procedures of this House, which have definitely been fossilising over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">These reformed procedures, including the ‘catch-the-eye’ system, appear to have worked extremely well – for example, for all the Members at open meetings of the Conference of Presidents – so I do not understand why they could not also be tried out more generally in plenary. If such trials show there are shortcomings in the system, we can always return to the old system. This is a matter of political choices, although we are also speaking about jurisprudence and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way Members are always the children of their own parliamentary culture. They all have experience gained in their own national parliaments, and it is perhaps difficult to find a European view in matters such as these. However, this report contains a very subtle element of balance that meets demands for greater efficiency and the requirements of democracy. Perhaps the fact that there will now be fewer amendments to discuss in plenary means that debates will be more political in nature and in that sense more interesting. Perhaps we will really have arguments now here in favour of or against the amendments tabled and the debates will also have more substance to them.</p>
<p class="contents">As images of the European Parliament start to be transmitted everywhere in Europe over the Internet I hope the picture will be a little more colourful than the television test card, and that there will be colourful speeches and argument, and real debate here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are, in a manner of speaking, the calling card that we present to the world outside. Being the only institution in the European Union to possess democratic legitimacy, Parliament is committed to the greatest possible transparency and clarity in the way it works, so that the citizens out there can also judge our working processes with an understanding of the thinking that underlies them. It is only through those processes being as clear and simple as possible that we will achieve the public acceptance of our work that we desire.</p>
<p class="contents">A member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, in particular, sees any MEP's main right as being that of putting questions to the Commission and having them answered. This right, of vital significance for the control of budgets in particular, is enshrined in Article 197 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities and in Rule 44 of the Rules of Procedure. It is an expression of Parliamentary control over the administration and must not be restricted. Attempts have, though, been made in the past to limit this right, for example by the framework agreement of July 2000, which restricts every MEP's access to documents and items of information. It was not least for this reason that Parliament has decided to alter this framework agreement as soon as possible. I take this opportunity to remind the President of his task in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that the report before us makes clear, in a supplement on Rule 44, that the content of questions for written answer is the sole responsibility of the questioner. This excludes the possibility of their being examined beforehand by the President or by a body of any kind. In the past, this too was at least a matter of doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will focus on the criticisms. Some were expected and some were surprising. I was surprised at the vehemence of Mrs Frassoni's criticisms. She made the same speech she made when we started our work in committee a year and a half ago. She also accused me of not listening to her speech, so I want to make a point of refuting her argument, because she seemed to make the point that we have moved on in one year and a half. I am glad that the shadow rapporteur from her group was very constructive. Indeed, many of the amendments I have tabled have been co-signed by her group and mine.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, let me refute some arguments that various speakers made. I am not trying to stifle debate or limit minorities. I am trying to expand the debate on the important subjects, to have more time on the really important and controversial matters. That, in turn, implies using simplified procedures for the less important and the less controversial matters.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we define less controversial? We have said that where there is a majority of over 90% in committee, we can take that <span class="italic">prima facie</span> as not controversial. Even then, we can go back to the usual procedures if only two groups or 32 Members make such a request. It is a very low threshold; it is very easy to go back to a full normal procedure. But let the onus be that way around. Let us assume that if it is simple and uncontroversial it can go through under a simplified procedure unless there is a request to the contrary, and then we will gain time for more debate, more views to be expressed on the important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I refute the argument that there is any danger to the language regime. Every Member will continue to be able to insist on his or her own language in all instances. I refute that we are scrapping the human rights issue. Like Mr Posselt I agree that human rights are very important. I am not proposing to scrap the issue: I am proposing a different procedure for dealing with it, a procedure which will give more weight to the detailed work done in the committee and which should produce even more important results than at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to other urgent matters. We are not scrapping them; we are proposing to deal with them under other procedures – either existing or new procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just clarify one or two other points. As regards "catch-the-eye", what is on the table is a compromise. "Catch-the-eye" would only come at the end of debates. Even then it is not obligatory. It says the President <span class="italic">may</span> have a round of catch-the-eye. That is a very reasonable compromise. If the people who have reservations about this are not even willing to try it out for a while at the end of debates, when the President so decides, then really there is not much willingness to compromise at all. I would urge those who are cautious about this to give it a try. There is no harm in trying it out.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards OLAF, the committee deliberately did not deal with this because the matter was <span class="italic">sub judice</span>. Now it seems that after the Court has ruled there is an appeal, so it will still be <span class="italic">sub judice</span>. But even if it were not, I would say that this would need thorough examination in committee rather than an amendment at the last minute in plenary. That is the reason why we have not come up with a proposal on OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission President and the vote on the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole, Mr Rothley has raised a valid point. Our national traditions are very divergent on this but it is right that it comes before plenary, and in many groups there will be differences of opinion on this. Mr Rothley has persuaded me personally but I know that there are many others in the House who still need to be persuaded.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the budget point, we had different views. Some said that for every item coming before this House there should be a detailed examination of the budgetary implications by the Committee on Budgets. Others said that this is a constraint on our rights to table amendments in plenary and we should not go down that road at all. We have come up with a compromise stating that explanatory statements must, where there are expected financial implications, contain an analysis as to how this is compatible with the financial perspective. This compromise will not satisfy everybody, but, again, it is a workable compromise for us to move forward at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the question of gender language. Mr President, you were quite right to point out that it only affects some languages. The language in which I drafted the report was not one in which there is gender discrimination and I would not have put it in. I would remind the House that four years ago, when adopting the report by Mrs De Palacio Vallelersundi and myself, we adopted a decision that the Rules should be revised by the services in all languages to ensure gender-neutral language. We do not need to come back to that issue; we need to ensure that what we decided as a parliament is now applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Corbett on his superb report and on the clear explanations he provided, both at the beginning and at the end. What is more, given that I was responsible for regulatory issues within my group in the Spanish national parliament for many years, I have followed this matter with the utmost interest and I share the concern over what to do in order to bring a Chamber closer to the citizens and enliven the debate whilst at the same time making it a sufficiently well-ordered working instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposals made by the rapporteur considerably improve the current Rules of Procedure and I congratulate him on this. It is his text and we can only try to cooperate as much as possible to make this Chamber a more lively one, which is closer to the citizens and enables us to convey to them and make them fully aware of our way of working, and on which we are concentrating all our efforts and dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that to the Prodi Commission – the President has always said this and repeats it whenever the opportunity arises, before this Parliament and before its various governing bodies – the relationship between the Commission and Parliament is a strategic factor and that, from the start, we have been committed to participating and cooperating as much as possible in the work and the functioning of this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The vast majority of the reports and legislative issues are handled directly in plenary by the corresponding Commissioners responsible. I believe this has changed tremendously in relation to past procedures. The Commission answers over three thousand parliamentary questions every year. I believe we have reached a suitable agreement with regard to the cooperation and participation of Parliament in international negotiations at which MEPs are customarily present, which I must say, to be quite frank, is most useful. And we are very satisfied with the functioning of the codecision procedure which, in my opinion, is proving to be a considerable success. I must also say, in this respect, that we are making a considerable effort to inform Parliament systematically before anyone else and provide it with at least as much information as the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the Framework Agreement – even though, as can be expected, there have been a few tense moments in its implementation – is proving a useful instrument in the workings of our relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat my congratulations. I hope that between us we shall be able to enliven all the European Union institutions and make the work of these institutions more understandable and more immediate, that is to say, make the European Union more understandable and closer to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
