<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andres Perello Rodriguez, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> –<span class="italic"> (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and their assistants and collaborators, as well as the secretaries, for the work they have done, because I believe it is thanks to them that we have managed to reach a hard-fought and difficult agreement on first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We are putting forward for debate a report that, in principle, should have been simple but has been extremely complex, as can be seen in the fact it has run five months over its initial timetable. However, we have ended up with a report that meets the two objectives set: firstly, to ensure the greatest possible clarity in the labelling of juices and certain similar products, and secondly, to guarantee the highest possible quality in the contents and ingredients of these juices.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement could be said to be the best possible outcome and can be summarised by highlighting the features of the main points on which we have reached agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the rules we will surely approve tomorrow, and which I ask you to vote in favour of, fully maintain the distinction between pressed fruit juices – also called fresh juices – juices from concentrate and fruit nectars. Of these, the first two – pressed juices and juices from concentrate – will not be allowed to contain added sugars once the rules come into force. This means they will be sold to consumers in their pure state and, by definition, only fruit nectars may be sweetened.</p>
<p class="contents">Nutrition claims of the ‘no added sugars’ type will vanish under the rules on labelling. For a limited length of time, however, a note may be included on packaging to clarify the situation for consumers, informing them that no juice may contain added sugars following the date of approval. Our aim is to ensure clarity and transparency at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">A much-needed dose of clarity is being introduced in the area of mixed juices, with the juice’s name having to be the same as its main fruit ingredient. This means the various fruit ingredients in the juice must be listed in descending order.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussions on the best way of ensuring equal treatment for all products consumed in the European Union, whether manufactured within the Union or not, were no less complex. In this area, we also reached an agreement that, with a few exceptions about products which do not greatly affect juice, and which must abide by the Codex Alimentarius, has resolved the matter in this directive quite well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no exaggeration if I tell you that Parliament has listened to all the sectors involved – farmers, consumers and manufacturers. Maybe the Council and the Commission should have paid more attention to the farmers, because although it is true their request arrived a little late, it is no less true, as I see it, that they were paid little heed.</p>
<p class="contents">There will probably be someone who can say they did not get their way 100%. In a report such as this one, with many interests involved, even if this may not seem to be the case, it is impossible for everyone to get their way in the negotiations. I am not referring to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, since everyone knows about the codecision procedure, but also the sectors involved – the industry, consumers and farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can assure you that, if any sector has the slightest complaint or feels that it has not got its own way, it is definitely not the consumer sector. This is something I can say quite clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we feel we have done a good job, and it is on this basis that I ask you to support this report with your vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement that was reached between the three institutions on the amendment of the directive on fruit juices. This directive on fruit juices contains a number of provisions ensuring the free movement of goods within the European Union, their quality, and, as Mr Perello Rodriguez pointed out, consumer protection. The compromise reached sets out the key points, particularly in terms of consumer information, and meets the requirements of Parliament on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that this is one of the first proposals by the Commission in the agricultural sector following the ordinary legislative procedure established by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. I appreciate all the more that through joint efforts between our institutions, discussions were able to be finalised at first reading. I think that it was a really good experience for everything that lies ahead in this ordinary procedure in the agricultural field.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive introduces a few new provisions. For example, it prohibits the addition of sugars to fruit juices and also specifies the timeframe during which the consumer can be informed of this ban, as stated by Mr Perello Rodriguez.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the existing provisions have also been elaborated in greater detail. For example, the provision relating to ‘multifruit’ juices has been revised so that the consumer is clearly informed by the product name of the list of fruits that make up the juice. Similarly, at the request of Parliament, the three institutions agreed on the fact that fruit nectars containing sweeteners could not be marked ‘no added sugar’ on the label.</p>
<p class="contents">Also at the request of Parliament, we have introduced a new article confirming that, in addition to goods produced in the European Union, imported goods must also comply with the directive. Lastly, other provisions, such as the distinction between fruit juice and juice from concentrate, have not been aligned with the Codex standard which, in this case, is less demanding. On this point, we are therefore more stringent than Codex standards. This decision, approved by a large majority of Member States and supported by Parliament, therefore meets our objective of encouraging better consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">With this agreement on the amendment of the directive on fruit juices and similar products, we now have a legislative text that clarifies certain requirements of the current directive, enriches it with new provisions, and thereby fulfils the objectives that were set.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to voice my agreement on the compromise established and rubber stamped by the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) on 18 November. I therefore hope that there will be a positive vote on the agreement reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is a second amendment to Directive 2001/112/EC and aims to make a better distinction between fresh fruit juices and fruit juices from concentrate and nectars. We wanted the rules to be simplified for restoring flavours and to introduce the mention of sugar being removed from the list of authorised ingredients. At the same time, there is also the proposal to authorise a limited period for having the description ‘with no added sugar’ printed on fruit juice labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the producers are concerned, we must give them the necessary period of time to adapt to this situation of producing juices with no added sugar and to inform consumers of all their products in every country that there will be new products available in stores without this description at the same time as existing products.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that consumers themselves must be kept informed of all the changes envisaged by the new directive. Last but not least, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this particularly important report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market.</p>
<p class="contents">The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars.</p>
<p class="contents">Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Germany opposed the text from the beginning, preferring to protect its own producers of concentrated fruit juice. For its part, Spain, and particularly the region of Valencia, the leading European orange juice producer, was happy to see it mixed with mandarin juice. This is what they do – so they say – in Brazil, a serious competitor and the world’s leading producer and supplier of 80% of the orange juice consumed by Europeans. For Europe is actually a very attractive market: every year, we drink 300 million litres of orange juice, or half of global consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">That just goes to show that the agreement reached, dragged out and produced by our rapporteur, Mr Perello Rodriguez, who I would also like to thank, with the European Parliament delegation, the Polish Presidency and the Commission, was anything but clear at the outset. That is why, on behalf of my group, I support the excellent compromise that was finally reached, which focuses on product quality but also clear consumer information</p>
<p class="contents">From now on – and it has been a hard-fought battle, mainly with Carl Schlyter – giving a juice or a nectar the name of a minor ingredient: strawberry juice, for example, where the main fruit in the drink is, in fact, apple, will no longer be allowed. This is very common practice at present. It is therefore a real paradigm shift, which will take some getting used to. A further key provision, this time in terms of health, is the practice of adding sugar to fruit juices now being prohibited. Here again, we have another latency period. It was ultimately important that the directive maintained national specificities through the unambiguous designation of products as a ‘fruit juice’, ‘fruit juice made from concentrate’ or ‘nectar’.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner, in particular, its influential Directorate for Agriculture: European fruit and vegetable growers are suffering. They are suffering because of the crisis and because of international competition. Keep listening to them, please, and do not promote the marketing of products from elsewhere –China, for example, or anywhere else for that matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At times, the negotiations were rather amusing. It could be considered strange that we have spent so many hours on such a limited subject as fruit juices, but at the same time, it was question of rather important principles. Should we maintain the EU’s high standard, where one exists, as opposed to the standard incorporated into international agreements? If we are to have a properly functioning single market, we must stop deceiving consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">During the negotiations, I brought these juice cartons with me and I am still bringing them with me right to the bitter end. Here is one example of juice packaging: high quality, full of lovely cranberries. The problem is that cranberries are not the main ingredient of the juice – it is apple. However, I do not see apple mentioned on the packaging or in the name. This is a product from France.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I have a product from Sweden/Finland. It is called raspberry/blueberry and there are raspberries and blueberries on the packaging. Hidden behind an enormous blueberry there is a very tiny apple. This is misleading, because this juice consists mostly of apple – it contains 10 times as much apple as raspberry and blueberry. Here is another fruit drink that is also sold on the European market. It has lovely strawberries and passion fruit on the packaging, but what do you think is the dominant fruit? It is apple, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is another one that is sold in six other countries in Europe. It states strawberry here, but do you think it contains any strawberries? Yes, it contains a very small amount of strawberries, but as usual it is mostly apple, and the apple on this packaging is hidden behind a symbol so that you can barely see it. This is misleading and fraudulent, and we are at last doing something about it. This is what I have been fighting for, and I am very pleased that this was the end result.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we also have another issue relating to how the product is labelled, in other words, what is said about the product. To start with, there was a certain amount of confusion with regard to the question of no added sugar, but in the end, I think we resolved it with a good compromise. For a short transitional period, consumers will be informed of the new rule that ordinary real juice must not contain added sugar. Then we will stop the use of this labelling, as it goes against the logic of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is normally the case that if there is a legal requirement for something, you must not highlight that property. If it is a legal requirement for there to be no added sugar, then this should not be stated on the packaging. I can accept it for a transitional period, however. Together with the Commission, we have also decided that it should not be permitted to start stating ‘no added sugar’ when the product contains sweetener.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, then, we achieved a result that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are able to support. I would like to thank everyone for the many long negotiations. We also had very interesting discussions and, in the end, we achieved a result that we can present to consumers. They will then be able to buy juice and know what they are getting – if they want to choose cheap artificial juice, they will know every time that it is cheap artificial juice, and if they want to choose real juice, they will know that that is what they are getting. That is what is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission, and also the Polish Presidency, who steered this difficult work to a successful conclusion. We should be glad that we are taking a significant step towards improving the quality of foods – juices are an important element of the food available – and that we are improving their quality while introducing more stringent requirements as regards information for consumers. These are all steps in the right direction. The European Union does a great deal in this field, but perhaps it should do even more. We should strive, by all means available, to ensure that food is of the highest quality and, above all, that the consumer obtains accurate and reliable information about food.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive achieves these objectives. It was not easy, because – as our colleagues have explained – conflicting interests had to be reconciled. The search for a compromise was long and hard, but the fruit of this work should be a cause for satisfaction. My group will, of course, vote in favour of the directive.

<p class="contents">With reference to the previous speech by Mr Schlyter, I have also often referred to the Commission the sale of fruit juices which are deliberately misleading, such as those products which cover the entire packaging with the image of a certain fruit, and then reveal in tiny writing on the back that the fruit is only a minor ingredient.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent case referred to the Commission, which involves a well-known brand from the same country indicated by Mr Schlyter, has packaging which shows the consumer an image of a waterfall of blueberries with the words ‘100% fruit smoothie’. On the back, in tiny lettering, the label states that the product contains only 8% blueberry juice and 40% apple juice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that – considering that 85% of orange juice is made from fruit grown outside the EU – in the interests of providing full information to consumers, this would have been a good opportunity to establish the obligation for the indication of origin on the label, but unfortunately even this was not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, our vote, despite the few criticisms we have, will be in favour, particularly considering that the long negotiations have created a text on which there is broad agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We criticised the fact that these packs list some fruits not contained in the product. This proposal in its current form will not change this. The positive thing about this proposal is that it will no longer be permissible to add sugar to fruit juices. That is the good news. I do not want to restate Ms Ayuso’s criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the fact is, however, that you speak of better consumer information. How can it be considered better consumer information when the pack does not indicate that the poorer quality of the oranges used has been improved by adding favours from other sources? That was not permitted in the past. Hitherto, only good quality fruit could be used, taking flavourings from the same batch and adding it back again. This was a principle of quality. We are now about to abandon this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue here is the addition of sugar. We have a labelling directive and it states that if it is printed on the packaging, it must be in the product. We are now going to confuse the consumer by stating ‘no added sugar’ on the pack. As this has been left off packaging for five years, the consumer will now believe that products contain sugar again. There is obviously a lack of clarity in the legislation you propose.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the procedure followed. I would like to address my fellow Members here. When only nine of the 31 amendments tabled in the Committee on the Environment are included in this so-called compromise, and four of these are technical measures, then we have nothing to thank the committee for. The text contains none of the committee’s proposals. The wishes of the Council and Commission have clearly been implemented in this instance, which is something that has greatly displeased us. Let me be quite honest with you. I intend to vote against this compromise because it is a poor solution, because it reduces the quality of products, and because it marginalises the procedure and Parliament itself. I cannot be a part of that. We should stop and think carefully about how we deal with a matter like this in future.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have had the first and second readings, but there is no need for a hasty decision. After all, our sole remit is to make decisions all day long. The document before us now is a bad piece of work.</p>

In my view, this piece of legislation, this compromise, as it has been styled, on fruit juice, is an example of that. I will tell you what the reality is.</p>
<p class="contents">After work, the average European rushes into their local supermarket, five minutes before closing time, with two tired children in tow, and is then confronted with a whole wall of fruit juices and fruit drinks, including so-called ‘fruit nectar’. I have asked a number of shoppers what the word ‘nectar’ makes them think of. It makes them think of all sorts of things, from bees to natural products. However, the last thing it suggests to them is that sugar might have been added to this so-called natural product. That is a fact. This average European is not going to read the small print when they have two crying children sitting in their trolley. That is not something they are going to have the time to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I, therefore, found the original Commission proposal more than justified. It contained a provision to the effect that any sugar being added to those fruit juices, or nectars, should be explicitly and clearly stated on the packaging. However, that proposal has been scrapped in its entirety. We no longer explicitly state on labels when sugar has been added to products, while at the same time, we do state, on fruit juices where the addition of sugar is prohibited, that no sugar has been added. That is turning the world on its head, surely! We state ingredients that are <span class="italic">not</span> there on labels while failing to state ingredients that actually <span class="italic">are</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I am astonished that the Commission is now defending this, because, when its proposal came out, it issued a lovely-sounding press release in which it said that we were going to get better at informing consumers when sugar had been added. Now it seems that the reality is very different. First, they make a big song and dance about it and, now, they are agreeing to this half-baked compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also astonished that members from the leftist groups, who are always the first to rush to the fore when it comes to providing better information to customers, are actually perpetuating customer confusion about this. Despite the fact that I am, sadly, going to be in the minority, I am going to vote against this compromise tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to consumer protection, I welcome the measures that have been taken in order to protect consumer interests by supplying them with as much information as possible, by ensuring unambiguous labelling of fruit juice, and in enabling them to distinguish between the different types of product sold on the market.</p>

<p class="contents">Furthermore – and this was the purpose of my amendment – in order to help consumers differentiate between juice and nectar in terms of their sugar content, the phrase ‘with no added sugar’ shall be allowed and will be reviewed five years after the entry into force of the directive.</p>

This is clearly about tightening up the directive, and it is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless followed with concern proposals to introduce a new requirement to label nectars with the terms ‘sweetened’ or ‘with added sugar’, followed by an indication of the maximum quantity of sugar added, calculated as dry matter and expressed in grams per litre. Such a change would greatly confuse consumers, and would obviously have a negative impact on producers. Nectars would become the only category of non-alcoholic drinks subject to a mandatory statement of the quantity of added sugar, which would put these products at a significant disadvantage compared to other drinks. I am therefore pleased that common sense has prevailed, and that the proposal did not go through.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the Czech Republic will also surely be pleased that, despite the euro crisis, European institutions have managed to solve a key long-term dispute as to whether tomatoes are a vegetable or a fruit. This European directive has established once and for all that tomatoes are the same as guava fruit. I nonetheless have doubts over Amendment 22, under which carrots are considered a fruit.

Only by receiving full, non-deceptive information about products used will consumers be able to make a proper choice. This year, we have taken a step in this direction by approving the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers, and now we are going further by setting additional requirements for specific categories of foodstuffs. Drinks going by the name of fruit juices can often be found in the shops today. However, it is often unclear what fruit they are made of, how much sugar or sugar substitutes they contain, or whether they are juices at all or a drink produced from certain other substances. The document we are discussing today is another step towards clarity in terms of establishing what can be called fruit juices. It is very important for all juices that are marketed in the European Union to be subject to the same requirements. Exceptions should not therefore be made for juices imported into the European Union. The European Union is a big enough market for producers to be able to adapt to the requirements we have introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">When we vote tomorrow, we can adopt this directive at first reading. It is important to bear in mind how lengthy the procedure would otherwise be. Although I am somewhat disappointed that the text negotiated at the trialogue does not reflect all of the amendments adopted by the committee, I nevertheless feel that in this instance, the agreement of all parties is more important as I believe that this will contribute to legal certainty and the protection of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do hope that her colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party will not stand up to defend the nonsense she said. After all, there is no such thing as popular, liberal or socialist fruit juice. There is either high-quality fruit juice or low-quality fruit juice. For this reason, I fully endorse the tabled proposal. Already a couple of months ago, when we were debating the directive on the labelling of foodstuffs, I stressed that regulation should, first and foremost, serve the interests of consumers. In the case of fruit juices, it is particularly important to eliminate means by which consumers can be mislead. It is a shame that Ms de Lange is not aware of this. Common belief holds that these products are all of natural origin and are healthy, but it is not so!</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are very often misled. Currently, there can be several markings on the packaging of fruit juices that can be misleading to consumers. The directive rightly aims to eliminate such practices. I agree with the prohibition on producers depicting fruit varieties not actually included in the fruit juice on the package. I also endorse the mandatory requirement to clearly indicate if a fruit juice was produced from concentrates, and to prohibit reference to such products as fresh fruit juice. It is important to indicate if a fruit juice contains artificial flavour enhancers. We must also make a clear distinction between fruit juices and fruit nectars, the latter being produced from concentrates or powders and having a high sugar content. All these requirements are in the interest of consumers and I therefore agree with the proposal and the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the great delights of being a Member of the European Parliament is that you can buy freshly pressed orange juice from machines both in Brussels and in Strasbourg. The one question I have though is: why is the price in Strasbourg almost twice the price you pay in the Parliament in Brussels? However, having said that, I also feel that there is a market for similar machines to be made available to consumers right throughout the European Union, because there is confusion regarding fruit juices – those pressed from fresh fruit and those from concentrates.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I want to make is that I was amazed in researching this to discover that 82% of the orange juice used within the European Union is imported, mainly from Brazil and the USA. I will agree with previous speakers that this has to be addressed in the reformed CAP so that we can avail of the opportunity to grow fresh fruit, particularly oranges for orange juice, within the European Union where there is a perfect climate for it. Certainly, that is an opportunity that we should not miss. It would improve fresh fruit and it would also lead to a reduction in the carbon footprint and CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling is absolutely vital; we have to give the best information possible to consumers, particularly in relation to added sugar. An awful lot of consumers at this point in time do not make the distinction. I think there is not just a need for what we are doing here this evening; there is also a need for an educational process. People are hungry and thirsty to get this information and, if they have it, they will act on it. This is a good move and I welcome it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw attention to a few points I feel are important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think that one of the basic obligations that we all have is to make the necessary efforts to stimulate European production. In actual fact, some European Union Member States have the potential and facilities to meet a large part of the fruit juice consumption on the European market, and we must support this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive impact of this can be viewed in a number of respects. There are benefits for the environment by ensuring that all the fruit is picked, which means that we avoid destroying produce unsuitable for direct sale or leaving it unpicked in the countryside, which causes the proliferation of pests. There are also socio-economic benefits because it generates added value for creating jobs and incomes for producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I would like to emphasise concerns the use of the words ‘with no added sugar’. I think that they are extremely important for consumers, especially for the different risk groups and children, since nowadays, the consumption of fruit juice is part of a healthy human diet and can be a factor in a balanced lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the compromises that have been reached are sufficiently clear and appropriate for differentiating between the individual types of drinks and their content, and will contribute to changing consumer habits, with the aim of achieving and supporting a good state of health.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I think that it is important that we do not lose sight of the balance between protecting consumer interests and those of European producers. Consumers are entitled to know exactly what they are consuming, but this does not need to lead to rules being imposed which will hurt European producers. This is a very important condition for small and medium-sized enterprises as they are far more sensitive to any legislative amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that we need to adopt the compromise version, even though it does not contain all our initial proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, however, that this compromise is a very good one for the consumer because it establishes freedom in decision making. This is something that we always wanted to achieve with food labelling. We are not looking to nanny anyone. We do not want to tell people what foods to buy or what drinks, whether a fruit nectar or a fruit juice. What we do want, however, is to provide the basis to enable consumers to make their decision based on reliable information. The compromise before us today establishes this freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Something we definitely need to do in parallel with this legislation is to run an information campaign. We need to educate people. This principle, health literacy, is one that we must bring to life. If people assume that a fruit juice with nothing on the pack to indicate that no sugar has been added actually contains no sugar, this means that they do not know enough. After all, a fruit juice must, by its nature, contain sugar. Not all consumers are aware of this and I believe that we – the European Parliament and the European institutions – really need to catch up in this regard. We need to empower people to make such decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that Council Directive 2001/112/EC is being amended for a second time means that, to ensure the necessary quality of fruit juices and similar products, it is necessary to respond to changes in production technology and the development of knowledge regarding the quality of this production. Producers frequently take advantage of loopholes in the rules and often offer consumers fruit drinks which do not contain the ingredients as declared on the label. More precise rules for the labelling of packages with regard to the actual composition of fruit drinks, as well as the fact that it will no longer be possible to add sugar to drinks labelled as fruit juice, will allow consumers to better distinguish the goods offered and to make a more informed choice from a wide range. We therefore expect broad support for the adoption of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the magical number was pronounced by Mr Kelly: 82% of the orange juice used within the European Union is imported. And in order for us to be able to take steps in line with the directive and reach a healthy, normal ratio, we will, on the one hand, need to increase fruit production in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we need to increase the percentage of fruit juice produced from European fruits among fruit juices available for purchase in the European Union. It is extremely ambivalent to be discussing this while in Central and Eastern Europe, vast fruit plantations are being cut down by orders or instructions of the European Union. In Hungary, for instance, it is the European Union that forces farmers to cut down fruit plantations. Yet, if the European Union were to spend only a fragment of the amounts it spends on African countries on the replanting of fruit plantations and the revitalisation of the processing industry, there would by now be prosperity in all of Eastern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As several of you have mentioned, this shows that the fruit and vegetable sector is of real value to us, that it is also seen in a positive light in terms of our health, and that we therefore have an interest in protecting and supporting this sector, as we have been doing through the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the best ways to support the fruit production sector is to gain and maintain consumer confidence. Following the Escherichia coli crisis this year, we saw how a lack of confidence among consumers could have a negative impact on producers. That is why I think that this directive, which we negotiated jointly and, I agree, is a good compromise, helps to strengthen consumer confidence as well as being beneficial for producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reassure Mr Schnellhardt, if that may help him to change his mind and to vote in favour of this directive, that this directive is fully consistent with the Labelling Directive because all the ingredients will be indicated on the label and in the name of the product, in the order of the quantities contained in the juice in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore as you can see, it does not clash with the Labelling Directive, which indeed requires all ingredients to be listed, except that they must be listed in descending order of percentage content.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Szegedi, I do not know what led you to think that the European Union forces Hungarian producers or any other European producers to uproot their trees. This has never been the case for any product and nothing forces a producer to make such a choice. I can assure you that there is nothing in the common agricultural policy or in any European decision that forces any European fruit producer to uproot their trees. Therefore, you need not be concerned, as fruit and vegetable producers will continue to receive support that will allow them to grow quality produce.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision, which I hope we are going to make, will help consumers to appreciate this quality. Some of you have raised the fact that a large quantity of juice is imported from outside of the European Union. What is important in the European Union is that we continue to ensure that the juices and fruits we produce succeed not so much in terms of quantity but of quality, because that is where added value lies. I think that it is important to support this, especially as we have a limited potential area for agricultural land, in any case, more limited than that of other producers around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which to help our producers to successfully earn a living is, above all, by helping them to grow quality produce and to realise its potential. I think that this directive will also help us to make a step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks, once again, to Mr Perello Rodriguez, and to thank all those who have worked on reaching this compromise and on moving towards a positive decision tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, nobody here can say that we are not providing consumers with information and nobody can try to claim that they speak for consumers’ interests more than the consumers’ associations themselves do. This is not our intention. You should read this directive again in depth and pay respect to the work done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about three speeches, those by Ms Ries, Mr Kelly and Ms Nedelcheva, which mentioned the need to promote and consume local products. The truth is that the European Union, virtually regardless of the country of production, is a powerful consumer and producer of fruit and packaged juices. We should encourage consumption of our own products as far as possible, in order to reduce atmospheric CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and promote European products at a time of crisis, particularly in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I support the three speeches that raised this issue, and add my voice to them. I also accept and support the Commissioner’s comments about working harder to improve both quality and quantity. We must do this, but the Union is a single entity and the place in which an item is produced is irrelevant. This must also be reflected in our fruits and juices.</p>

<p class="contents">What we could not accept is something that is technically impossible, which is to compulsorily add to the juice – to help goodness knows who – the flavour of the very fruit being pressed. This is technically impossible when the juice is stored in four-million-litre tanks and you need 10 000 litres to get two litres of flavour, and this should have been made clear. I genuinely and cordially invite you to read the directive in detail, because if you do you will surely change your mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When choosing juices, consumers are not entirely sure whether the juices are made from squeezed fruit or from concentrates. Another incorrectly interpreted term is the word ‘nectar’, the definition of which, as the rapporteur underlines, is not agreed even among manufacturers. Information about sugar content is absolutely necessary, particularly for persons with health problems. Uniformity of terminology and clear consumer information about products are the top priority. Another issue to be borne in mind is that increased consumption of locally produced juices should be encouraged. Over 80% of consumption in Europe consists of juices imported from across the Atlantic. Obviously, our citrus fruits are not as beautiful and ripe as Brazilian ones, but they are ideal for juice production. If we want to ensure food security in the EU and protect the environment by reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions from transport, we should strongly support the European fruit juice market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that more needs to be done to clarify the situation to allow for free and informed choices. For example, a mixture of 90% apple juice and 10% strawberry juice will have to be labelled as ‘apple and strawberry juice’, whilst currently, the label is allowed to state ‘strawberry juice’. A generic name such as ‘juice mixture’ can be used if the product is manufactured from three or more fruits. This is the direction taken by the resolution which was voted on today, making the consumer the focus of the legislator’s attention. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to which I belong also considers as equal the demands of producers: until now, European producers have been treated differently compared with their colleagues in third countries (the US and China, for example), who have imported fruit juices into the EU which have occasionally not undergone the strict controls to which European producers were subject. Today, we have guaranteed that this discrimination will stop, by imposing the same obligations on importers from third countries and ensuring that consumers can freely choose what product to buy on the basis of its quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
