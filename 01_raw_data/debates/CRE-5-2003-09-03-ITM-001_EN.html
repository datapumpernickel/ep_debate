<p class="contents">I would also like to put on record my immense regret that the Cuban authorities have not been prepared to cooperate, and that Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas, the winner of the Sakharov Prize, has, alas, not been allowed to leave Cuba and take part in this debate, which I would like to take as an opportunity to express to him and to his friends our solidarity with them, so that it may be made clear that the democratic opposition in Cuba enjoys our support and solidarity. For this reason, I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us how we are now to proceed in order to prevent human rights from being violated, how we may support the seventy human rights activists who have been in jail since 18 March 2003, and what means exist for setting at liberty political dissidents in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba is one of the last Communist regimes and its economic system is also the wrong one. Both these factors, taken together, explain the catastrophic situation in which the country finds itself. We can now discuss whether or not a boycott, such as that imposed on Cuba by the United States, is the right strategic approach to adopt, but this boycott is not the cause of the problems. I think this has to be made very clear. The fact is that, in the days when there were still Communist regimes in Europe, the massive aid to the former German Democratic Republic, including such things as loans to the tune of billions, which gave the GDR every opportunity for trade as a <span class="italic">de facto</span> Member State of the European Union, did not bring about the development of a democratic system in the GDR that was capable of meeting the economic and social needs of its people in a proper and civilised manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is in this context, and with clarity, that we have to see our dealings with Cuba, and that we should therefore consider whether this is in any way the right approach in view of Cuba’s accession to the Cotonou Agreement. If this were conditional on Cuba opening itself up, on greater freedom to travel, on the free movement of persons – including members of the opposition – then, in Cuba too, a start could be made on a proper process of transition. For that to happen, though, we need to see progress in certain areas. I would therefore be very interested to learn, both from the Council and the Commission, how a transformation strategy of this sort might be set in motion, whereby one of the last Communist dictatorships might be brought down, something that would be desirable from the point of view of the people who are its victims in this wretched country. I therefore look forward with eager anticipation to what the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have to tell us on this subject.</p>

<p class="contents">The Council Presidency has, on a number of occasions in past months, issued public statements and made vigorous representations to the Cuban Government since the deterioration – we can make no bones about this – in March 2003 of the already precarious situation as regards the exercising of individual freedoms and rights in Havana. Recently, on 21 July 2003, the European Council confirmed that the objectives of the European Union’s policy on Cuba remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the promotion of a process of transition to a pluralist democracy, and sustainable economic recovery to improve the quality of life of the Cuban people. The Presidency notes that, since the last evaluations, not only has the Cuban Government not taken any positive measures to satisfy the objectives of this European measure but the human rights situation has also deteriorated further.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union expects the Cuban authorities to reintroduce the <span class="italic">de facto </span>moratorium on the death penalty; we call once again upon the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners immediately and we call for the prisoners not to be subjected to suffering or inhumane treatment in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, the media – the Cuban media themselves – have reported that Internet access is being increasingly limited, that satellite television stations and also foreign newspapers and radio broadcasting equipment have been seized. Freedom of movement is extremely restricted, both within the country and at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency regrets the lack of – even – intention to proceed towards restoration of economic and civil freedoms. All this certainly makes the daily lives of the Cuban citizens difficult. Once again, we strongly urge and encourage the Cuban Government to give an indication of economic reopening and of the existence of a private economic sector in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of what I have just said, the Presidency calls, once again, for a change of attitude. The common position already issued in recent months still stands: there must be a constructive, ongoing endeavour to lay the foundations of the Union’s policy on Cuba. In order to promote more effective implementation of the objectives of this European common position, the Council believes that we need to pursue political dialogue, intense, critical dialogue, indeed, to contribute to the achievement of tangible results, first and foremost in the field of politics and, therefore, where political freedoms, the economy and civil rights are concerned too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would therefore be willing – and I use the conditional tense here – to support an increase in European Union development cooperation where Cuba is concerned, in the areas which could further the transition, the path to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, and in the areas which could improve the quality of life of the Cuban people and therefore contribute to sustainable economic growth too.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Presidency, these funds should be granted only where there is a guarantee of a genuine, immediate benefit for the Cuban people or a major contribution to a process of opening up Cuba to a series of economic reforms. Clearly, therefore – and I will conclude by answering some of the questions posed by Mr Brok – the measures adopted by Cuba, which Europe deems to be a violation of fundamental civil and political rights, have influenced the Union’s relations with the country.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Commission has already said, it has decided to postpone its evaluation, which is necessary to any analysis of Cuba’s request to sign the Cotonou Agreement. Moreover, the withdrawal of Cuba’s request for the second time on 17 May 2003 came as no surprise, although the Council is not required to comment on that decision. I will merely say that we were not surprised.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures made public through the initiative of 5 June last and the Council’s conclusions of June and July 2003 seek to make clear the European Union’s support for the Cuban non-violent, democratic opposition and to show the Cuban authorities that trade cannot proceed normally in the absence of tangible gestures from that government. Our concern relates to political freedoms, as I said, and also to the refusal – despite limited, hesitant openings – to allow greater private initiative in the economic sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s Heads of Mission will continue to monitor the situation of political prisoners and conditions in which they are being held in Havana. Political dialogue with Cuba, resumed in 2001, should certainly be pursued, but under the conditions and constraints which I have mentioned. Of course, political dialogue also covers the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We regretted the refusal to take part in political dialogue expressed by the Cuban authorities in public statements made even just recently and the public decision to reject funding from European countries and from the Commission. Over these six months, the Presidency, consulting Parliament for its opinions, will concentrate on finding ways of increasing the tangible effectiveness of political dialogue, ensuring that it is frank, constructive and, of course – when necessary – critical too.</p>

<p class="contents">I will try to deal as directly as possible with the seven questions raised by Mr Brok.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring the growth of internal opposition. I met a group of the most well-known Cuban dissidents during my visit to Havana in March 2003. The recent EU decision to invite dissidents to national day festivities, as the Commission did on 9 May 2003, recognises the role of the internal opposition. I must also add that regular meetings with opposition groups in Cuba have taken place at the initiative of Member States in Havana.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the Commission have established a Human Rights Working Group in Havana to follow human rights issues in Cuba, including the matter of political prisoners. The Commission is regularly informed of detention conditions through this working group and through bilateral contacts with family members of those imprisoned, as well as with local human rights groups. The European Union has repeatedly called for an immediate release of all political prisoners and has appealed to the Cuban authorities that, in the meantime, the prisoners do not suffer unduly and are not exposed to inhumane treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Repression in Cuba has received a prompt, firm and sustained reaction from the Union. Last July it re-evaluated the common position on Cuba, six months ahead of schedule. This re-evaluation reaffirmed that constructive engagement remains the basis of EU policy towards Cuba. The EU intends to continue its dialogue with Havana to promote political, economic and civil rights reforms and is willing to provide aid whenever possible via non-governmental organisations in order to promote democratisation and improve living standards for ordinary Cubans. I believe that the common position is the best policy instrument we now have for Cuba. It is a coherent policy document and should, therefore, be maintained in its present form. Based on it, political dialogue with the government and the opposition needs to be strengthened, as well as the promotion of human rights, pluralist democracy and an open economic system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regrets the decision of the Cuban Government to withdraw its application for accession to the Cotonou Agreement. Cuba is the only Caribbean, and practically the only developing, country in the world with which the Commission has not been able to sign a cooperation agreement. Membership of the Cotonou Agreement would have provided the right framework to develop a structured dialogue with the Cuban authorities and to improve the delivery of aid to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is positive about the operation of our new delegation in Havana. Our presence in Cuba is more important today than ever. The main tasks of the delegation are not only to assist with the implementation of aid programmes and projects, but also to promote a political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society, to monitor human rights issues and to protect the interests of the Member States in terms of trade and investments.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the events that have taken place recently, the Commission Delegation in Havana will have to focus its attention in the future more on monitoring the human rights situation in Cuba, on trying to promote a political dialogue and on looking after the trade interests of the EU Member States. This is a heavy and difficult agenda to pursue, but it is essential if we wish to promote political and economic changes in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest evaluation of the common position encourages the strengthening of EU development cooperation in Cuba in areas that promote the transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, that improve the living standards of the population of Cuba and promote sustainable economic growth. The common position states that funding should only be channelled through governmental institutions if it directly benefits the population or if it promotes a meaningful contribution towards economic reform and a more open economy in Cuba. Commission projects have been undertaken in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a recent statement from Havana, it seems that in future the Cuban Government will only accept aid from the Commission and the EU Member States that is channelled through UN agencies, NGOs, foundations, solidarity movements, autonomous regions and local governments. Furthermore, the Cuban Government will apparently refuse to negotiate directly with the Member States and the Commission on development cooperation themes, programmes and projects and will only agree to deal with NGOs on such issues. However, as the Commission has worked mainly with NGOs and independent technical assistance teams in the past anyway – and with good results – there is no reason to believe that the same cannot continue in the future. The only thing we need to ensure is that the visibility of Community operations is maintained and also that monitoring of such operations by EU bodies can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was informed that the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights is not currently funding projects in Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, the prison conditions of those sentenced, according to all the news, Mr Nielson, clearly violate human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, at this time, the essential thing, the priority, must be to deploy all the resources available to us to protect those sentenced and their families. I would ask Commissioner Nielson to tell us what he is doing in relation to the Commission’s delegation, recently opened up in Havana.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cuban authorities must have no doubt that liberation is an essential requirement if they hope to move in the direction of normalising our relations. Furthermore, they must explicitly protect other dissidents who are not under arrest, such as the current holder of the Sakharov Prize, Mr Oswaldo Payá. The authorities’ refusal to allow him to be with us today – announced by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy – seems to me to be very worrying, and I would ask the Presidency of the European Parliament to support the Committee on Foreign Affairs in relation to its intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation – as Minister Frattini has said – it is clear that it is not possible to change the common position set in 1996 and we must – and I address this directly to the President—in-Office of the Council – prevent any gesture which could be interpreted as an internal difference within the European Union. On the contrary, we must preserve the current unified approach and I am glad that the Italian Presidency is making efforts in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also reject the Cuban authorities’ attempts to divide us and therefore measures such as the demonstration of 14 June or the closure of the Spanish Cultural Centre are not so much acts of aggression against a Member State as against the whole of the European Union. Mr President, our only purpose must be to improve the living conditions and areas of freedom of the Cuban citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European position should clearly be to reject this double embargo, these two embargoes, which feed off each other, and which promote the most intransigent positions with regard to the future of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation of totally closed positions, uncertainties are appearing with regard to how Cuban politics will evolve. The only certainty is that the person with practically all the decision-making power is 77 years old and, therefore, things in that country are going to change.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years there has been a significant emergence of demands for democratic change inside and outside Cuba and, in this regard, the wave of brutal and entirely unacceptable oppression which was unleashed a few months ago contains a political lesson: the need to try, if not to break, at least to slow down this entirely ineluctable process.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, we should not have any illusions with regard to the possibilities of modifying current political decisions on the basis of pressure. If 40 years of embargo have not helped to do this, I believe we should abandon any tactical approach of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">From a qualitative point of view, we must take a different position: in view of the prospect of inevitable change, to help the Cuban people, to alleviate their sufferings and their needs and to hold constructive dialogue in order to prevent the change from taking the form of civil confrontation or violent confrontation but, on the contrary, to take the form of peaceful transition based on dialogue, agreement and the national independence of Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this must be the principle underpinning the European Union’s position in relation to the current crisis of change in Cuba. On this basis, moreover, we must be intransigent and vigorous in our demands for human rights for the Cuban people and the demand that those dozens of opposition members, intellectuals and journalists who are in prison should be released, that all people imprisoned as a result of their political persuasions or opinions should be liberated. This must be the essential factor in the European Union’s pursuit of a constructive policy of dialogue and solidarity with the Cuban people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the proposals for cooperation, for promoting openness, democratic transition and economic support have come up against a brick wall of intolerance, rejection and, what is worse, a response which, as has been said, affects dozens of members of the Cuban opposition, independent journalists and human rights activists.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation requires a categorical response and, as has been requested here, a unanimous and very clear response on the part of the institutions of the European Union, in order to promote the democratic process and, fundamentally, to guarantee human rights – some of which are as essential and important to a society as the exercise of freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must make every effort and continue to do so in order firstly to demonstrate the position of the European institutions – this is expressed very clearly in this joint resolution, which I hope will be approved by the European Parliament today – and secondly to demonstrate our cooperation and solidarity with the members of the opposition who wish to see a free and democratic Cuba, with the activists and defenders of human rights working through the respective non-governmental organisations, demonstrating our particular concern for the leader to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize, Mr Oswaldo Payá, and in order to contribute to preventing, as far as possible, the suffering of the Cuban population, who are the main victims of the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group also criticises the lack of freedoms and rights in Cuba – as it does in the rest of the world – but I would like to point out my experiences when I travelled from Argentina to Colombia and to Cuba last December. In Argentina I saw children suffering from hunger in the Tucumán hospital, in Colombia I saw people killed – there are thousands of deaths every year – by paramilitaries and also by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) with the complicity of the paramilitaries, the justice system and the army, but when I reached Cuba I found that children were not hungry – on the contrary, infant mortality is amongst the lowest in the world – there is culture, there is education, there are not thousands of deaths every year – as there are in Colombia – and there is therefore an obvious contrast.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union can and must play a completely different role with regard to Cuba, a positive role, and one which is totally opposed to that of the United States. In fact, one of the most important elements in understanding what is happening in Cuba comes from the conduct of the United States: the permanent blockade which has lasted more than 40 years, the Helms-Burton laws – condemned by the UN and denounced by the European Union – are a serious abuse. We must remember the siege and the actions against Cuba – also promoted by the United States – which have led to more than 3 500 Cuban victims and immense economic losses. All of this implies pressure and great influence from the anti-Cuban mafias in Florida, which, by the way – what a coincidence – have given victory to Bush, in one case, by a narrow margin – and also a rather doubtful one – as well as significant promotion for Mr Aznar in Spain, both in 1996 and in 2000, as acknowledged by a magazine in Miami which stated that Aznar’s victory was a victory for Cuban dissidents.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this indicates that the general context is one of continuous siege by the United States. Colin Powell himself recognises that USD 22 million are channelled to the dissidents, in order to promote disturbances, in order to even promote an assault, as in the case of the actions in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should recognise that the European common position has failed, it is something that Aznar has imposed on the European Union and which takes us nowhere, and our position should therefore be one of dialogue without conditions, one of promoting cultural and economic agreements with Cuba, because that is the message which the rest of Latin America, and the rest of the world, expects. Because, as Fidel Castro quite rightly said in January 1999 – when the euro was put in place – the euro gives great hope that the developing world, and all countries, will be able to be freed from the yoke of the dollar. I believe that the European Union must play this positive role and not the negative role played by the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union, one of whose aims is to promote universal and inalienable human, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, can only vigorously condemn this authoritarian attitude on the part of the Cuban regime towards its people who legitimately aspire to fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, however, is not entirely in the clear either. Its relations with Cuba can truly be classed as unique. Indeed, Cuba is the only country in Latin America not bound by a bilateral cooperation agreement with the European Union, despite the fact that through some of its Member States, the Union is the main source of business and investment in Cuba. Following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the Union became the island’s main trading partner and in this capacity, we believe that the Union’s key role presents exceptional opportunities for exerting moral and political influence in order to take democracy and respect for human rights forwards in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The other unique feature resides in the status of the island within the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Cuba has been accepted as a Member of the ACP Assembly but remains an observer on the Joint Committee. Cuba is also the only country for which the Union stipulates conditions that must be fulfilled before it can sign the Cotonou agreement. Do we in the Union not have a responsibility to treat countries equally? Cuba should be treated in exactly the same way as any other country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must consequently play a key role where Cuba is concerned. Whilst respecting its sovereignty and dignity, it can work towards achieving a peaceful, internal democratic transition and pursue a policy that could persuade Cuba to adopt positive measures such as signing and implementing the United Nations conventions on civil and political rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cuban people are suffering. They are suffering as a result of the policy of confrontation with the United States after 44 years of the blockade and the Helms-Burton law. It is suffering as a result of an authoritarian regime presiding over a ruined economy and it is in the values of the European Union that these people are putting their hope. The Union must understand this and Castro’s regime must accept this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is no longer simply a matter of the arbitrary arrests that were made a few months ago and the extremely harsh sentences that have been handed down. Fidel Castro’s regime still responds to the international community in a negative way and persecution is unfortunately still taking place in that country, which is so dear to many of us. I also wish to clear up the confusion about US policy, which is sometimes referred to. At no time has Europe, the European Union or any Member State adopted a policy towards Cuba that could be confused with the policy pursued by the United States. We are consequently all the more disappointed and indignant, because the Cuban regime has betrayed and rejected our good faith and has dashed our hopes of seeing positive developments in the Cuban regime, expressed in particular through the attempt at openness made by a delegation at the beginning of the year and in the visit to Cuba made by Commissioner Nielson, also at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, come up with a response that is imaginative, consistent and clear. As you all know, I have set great symbolic and political store by what I have called the ‘Sakharov Initiative’ and I am pleased to see that, following the enormous support this has received in the House, it now appears in the text of the compromise resolution. The initiative calls on the Italian Presidency, the Commission and Parliament to invite Oswaldo Payá to return to Europe, to come here to our plenary, and to be received in the European capitals at the highest level. It also calls on us to play a leading and highly visible role in the struggle and the suffering of the Cuban people for their human rights – this is the right way to move ahead and also to demonstrate the value we attach to a prize awarded by Europe, a prize that was awarded only a year ago and which we must monitor, actively demonstrating our solidarity and commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, I believe, is a mistake for three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in general terms, we should stop selecting the States with which we conclude cooperation agreements on the basis of highly subjective criteria founded on political and humanitarian views and, far too often, on the dictates, it must be said, of US policy. With regard to Cuba, as elsewhere, we should stick to objective criteria, such as, in the very straightforward words of General de Gaulle – which still inspire French policy – recognising States; nation States and not governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we should take account of one particular fact: Cuba is one of the Latin American countries with which Europe is most closely involved. The European Union is Cuba’s main trading partner and its largest investor; Cuban culture, literature and music are amongst the most cherished by Europe’s youth. Lastly, President Castro is still, despite the highs and lows that we have heard so much about and which we certainly do not deny, the living embodiment of the twentieth century rebel, of the defender of people’s freedoms, which has earned considerable benevolence towards the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have all the more reason to be circumspect on the issue of human rights because the United States – which the German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, described on a visit to Washington in July as the main ally of every European State – without any mandate, moreover – have for the last year and a half used a Cuban enclave, Guantanamo, to breach practically every principle of international law and to settle their scores using somewhat barbaric methods more suited to another age. For all of these reasons, I believe we should review our attitude towards Cuba and show that country greater solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have tried everything and I feel that the answer is simply to take a harder line, so much so that a Socialist Member was prompted to say ‘We hope that Fidel Castro, who is 77 years old, will die, so that …’, for, quite frankly, Fidel Castro has been a thorn in our side for some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe we could reflect on another point, we could reflect on the fact that, when our democracies are divided over a dictator, we will not go far. The time may have come to talk about the World Organisation of Democracies, Mr President, Commissioner, in an attempt to adopt a more coherent attitude, a more coherent approach. Let us consider it, for we have tried everything. What is the point, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of keeping a delegation open when we are dealing with an official who appears to be a hostage of the regime more than anything, and is certainly not a promoter or defender – or is a purely symbolic, certainly not genuine defender – of civil and human rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The frustration is real: constructive dialogue with a dictator is proving to have its limits and the real question is what to do.

Unfortunately, Cuba is an anomaly within the history of the European Union’s foreign relations, as has been pointed out here.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1995, it was not possible to fulfil the mandate given by the Summit to the Commission to present directives with a view to reaching a bilateral agreement at that time. And now, for the second time, Cuba’s incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement is being rejected, at a time when international attention, Mr President, has been focused on the Iraq crisis and taking advantage of that situation there has been a wave of repression, unprecedented in recent years, which has resulted in three death penalties and a wave of arrests which have affected independent journalists, human rights campaigners and peaceful dissidents, many of them from the Christian Liberation Movement.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is going to adopt a very tough resolution, expressing its inescapable commitment to the cause of human rights and to all those in Cuba and outside it who are fighting for its freedom and its dignity. And I would ask myself, Commissioner, whether in these circumstances, with a country which does not wish to have a link with the European Union – because it has rejected incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement for a second time; with a country whose leaders reject Community aid; with a country whose leaders insult and denigrate European Union Heads of Government; with a country which imposes endless restrictions on the presentation of identity cards by the Commission’s diplomatic representative, it is worth, Commissioner, keeping the office in Havana open.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft compromise resolution, which will be voted on tomorrow, contains a condemnation of the closure of the Spanish Cultural Centre in Havana. And this does not surprise me, Mr President, because culture is freedom and, therefore, the person who knows most is the most free.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do not know is whether the Cuban authorities know that it is much more difficult to preserve and maintain the balance of freedom than to bear the weight of tyranny. The people who know this best, Mr President, are exemplary people – such as Oswaldo Payá, the winner of this Parliament’s Sakharov Prize, nominee for the Prince of Asturias Cooperation Prize and nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize – who bravely fight for their rights as people and as citizens and ultimately for their freedom, because they are perfectly aware that at the end of the day, Mr President, freedom – as a compatriot of mine said some years ago – does not make men happier, but simply makes them men.</p>

It is at this point that I must counter what Mr Brok said and make it clear that it was the American sanctions that drove Castro into the Communist camp. It was not at Moscow’s behest that Castro led a revolution; he was prompted to do so by the unrest among the Cuban people. That is what makes the American sanctions policy so very, very damaging, in both political and economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">This would make it all the more important now for good relations with the European Union to be developed but Fidel Castro has unfortunately failed to recognise the signs of the times. He is himself engaged in destroying everything that the revolution stood for and trampling underfoot its undoubted successes. I find this particularly regrettable, as the eventual consequence will be that Cuba will, like a ripe apple, fall into the hands of the Americans and of American big business.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats have stood up for freedom throughout the world, and Cuba is no exception. As Social Democrats, we are opposed to the death penalty, always and everywhere – and Cuba is no exception. So it is that we, as Social Democrats – and, I hope, everyone in this House as Europeans – oppose repression, and it goes without saying that Cuba is no exception. It is, though, a matter of concern to us that the introduction of democracy and of a freely-chosen economic system should be peaceful and not enforced, whether by what one might term Castro’s internal power relationships or by international big business. The people of Cuba must have freedom to choose their leaders, democracy, their parliamentary representatives, and their economic system.</p>
<p class="contents">Castro has provoked the EU. Many have said that – and they have been quite right to do so – but I do not take the view that we must now respond by in some way breaking off relations or by putting them on ice. Mrs Bonino is wrong; this is not about dialogue with dictators. Castro is a dictator, and he would be delighted if the European Union were to withdraw, but would the dissidents be pleased to learn that they would be getting no more support from such sources as the Human Rights Working Group that Commissioner Nielson mentioned? Would the people of Cuba be happy if the European Union were to cease its involvement in Cuba? I think the opposite would be the case, and so I want to endorse unreservedly what Commissioner Nielson said: we need a delegation in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Bonino, in that I would want the European Union to be represented by more than just one person. The European Union needs also to have a visible presence in Cuba, and I think it absolutely right that it should have one. The European Union’s presence in Cuba is important, in that it will enable Cuba to introduce a democratic system. What Cuba needs is democracy and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These also include a number of Liberals whom I have met personally in Cuba, such as Osvaldo Alfonso Valdés, the leader of Cuba's Liberal Democratic Party and Adolfo Fernández Sainz, the international secretary of the Party for Solidarity and Democracy. This happened less than a month after the European Commission’s office in Cuba was opened. It is not only a violation of human rights, but also a slap in the face for the European Union. I value the activities that our Cuban office has subsequently taken. We must give a clear signal to the regime in Cuba that we no longer tolerate the situation. A restriction of high-level bilateral government visits, as announced by the Council in its statement of 5 June, is, however, too weak a measure. We must be clear in what we say and as far as I am concerned, the Council should consider taking the same measures as we have done in Zimbabwe, namely deny Fidel Castro access to the European Union, as, in fact, Greece has done in the context of the Olympic Games. I have a great deal of appreciation for this, and I also wonder whether the Council has discussed this and whether the Council supports the Greek Government's decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only is the human rights situation abysmal, but the economy is a disaster too. We all have our opinions about the United States' foreign policy, but America's embargo was introduced following systematic human rights violations in Cuba, and not the other way round. The United States is for the Castro regime the scapegoat that is blamed for everything that goes wrong. Quite a few Members of this House are guilty of this rather simplistic way of thinking. To some, a dictatorship is quite justifiable as long as it is politically correct. The European Union must respond to the current situation in a forceful manner. This means that we must stand united. Castro no longer wants any support from the European Union, only from NGOs and other private organisations. In the Netherlands, organisations such as Novib, Oxfam and Hivos are currently receiving the criticism that they are offering support to one of the world's last Communist dictatorships via support to bodies such as the Anap farmers' union, Casa de las Americas and the Martin Luther King Centre. According to Carlos Payá, spokesman of the Faella Project and brother of Osvaldo Payá, financing these organisations is tantamount to financing Castro. Let us play into Castro's hands; support of any kind to the regime should be withdrawn, and if it transpires that NGOs use European subsidies inappropriately to support the Cuban regime, their funding should be cut off too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For a long time the Cuban Government has been able to blame all the country's woes on the American embargo. As soon as serious discussions take place on a possible relaxation of the embargo, the Cuban authorities engineer a provocation to scupper such developments.</p>
<p class="contents">These latest moves appear to be part of that pattern, albeit aimed at a European audience this time. Nevertheless Cuba cannot escape with impunity, and it is vital that we send a clear signal to the authorities that violations of fundamental rights, including a lack of medical care for prisoners, cannot be tolerated. Nor should Cuba be allowed to participate fully in the interparliamentary meetings between representatives of the European Union and Latin Americans, such as the Parlatino, as though it were a functioning democracy, whilst Castro's suggestion that EU humanitarian aid can only be given if it is distributed in a disguised fashion via other agencies is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid needs to be transparent. Cat-and-mouse games need to give way to a more reasoned dialogue in which ways are found to open up the country to change, whilst preserving some of the genuine achievements of the revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I generally do not support the closing of European Community delegation missions abroad, so a small presence in Havana is useful. However, it is bizarre that we have an office there but not in some of our neighbouring European countries- we do not have an office in Chisinau, Moldova, nor in Minsk in Belarus. The latter is another country where contact with human rights activists is also essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking in particular of Oscar Espinosa Chepe who is today hospitalised in the prison ward of the Finlay Military Hospital in Havana, seriously ill as the result of chronic cirrhosis of the liver – from which he suffered at the time of his arrest – and which has been aggravated by his weakness and the bad prison conditions and hygiene to which he has been subjected.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation and in view of the facts it is essential that we reiterate our unanimous condemnation of the Castro regime and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners, and it is also essential that we express our solidarity with the Cuban people, who most directly suffer the consequences of the lack of freedoms and demonstrate to them through action – rather than words – that we wish to help them to take the road of peaceful transition towards democracy they have set out upon.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano said, Cuba hurts. It does indeed hurt to see political, economic and social freedoms continuing to be violated. And because we in this Parliament are hurt by it – and today we are receiving representatives of those countries which had been deprived of freedom under the Soviet totalitarian regime – we wish to tell them that they should not lose hope. We wish to tell them that no dictator can suffocate the right to rights in relation to aspirations for freedom and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to say to Mr Brok – who was very close to using rhetoric that sounded as if he wanted regime change – that nowadays we have to be careful about the exact wording in applying that type of language, especially when we discuss the methodology of such action.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with the need for pressing on with the process of democratisation and opening up political life in Cuba. This is exactly what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was a remark about Cuban participation in the Joint EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly: as long as Cuba is not a party to the Cotonou Agreement, that participation is the answer. It is clearly defined and we have no problem technically or politically on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, two different views were expressed about the delegation in Havana. It is quite clear that this delegation is not only useful in this situation but also essential in order for the Commission to do what Parliament expects and asks of us. We have to have a presence there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge that we do not cause any provocation by the way we handle things in Cuba. I see a lot of turmoil behind the tragic events of this year. It is important we stick to a long-term perspective: there will be a Cuba after Castro and nations are more important than regimes. Although we feel frustrated by the current situation, we have to realise that there are very good basic, long-term reasons for a close, friendly and harmonious relationship between Europe and Cuba. We have to keep that in mind and stick to a more cool-headed, long-term approach and this is what we will do on the basis of the established common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
