<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wolf Klinz (ALDE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of examining the asset management sector, the Commission, in August 2005, presented a Green Paper and asked for comments on it. It has received something like 121 replies in total, which clearly indicates just how significant a sector this is, for in it, business is booming. Today, collective investment undertakings (UCITS) are a brand name, and not just in Europe; they are being traded in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong as well, and very soon will be in South America too.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union alone, the total value of the sector’s investment assets last year amounted to over EUR 4 600 billion, which is something like EUR 900 billion more than in 2004. This House’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has decided to respond to the Commission's Green Paper by producing an own-initiative report. As the rapporteur, there were certain goals of which I never lost sight: a functioning internal market in UCITS; an attractive and safe range of products for investors, particularly for small investors; and an efficient asset management industry that would have no need to fear increasingly global competition. Although the alternative market now exists, it is not yet working properly, and so the consumer does not have the best possible access to comparable products, and the industry cannot benefit from the economies of scale that a large single market offers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for revision in three areas: firstly, in the choice of investments, which the national supervisory authorities interpret in differing ways, the consequence of which can be that a fund is approved in one country but not in another. There are costs involved in developing a product, and if it cannot be marketed throughout Europe, but only in individual countries, there is a considerable cost disadvantage. One aim, then, must be to find a precise definition of the investments on offer that will apply right across Europe. I agree with CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, that it ought to be possible, to a certain degree, to add quoted real-estate funds, the so-called REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts), private equity funds and certificates to the mix. I also think it is worth considering the possibility of including funds of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is what is termed the notification procedure. The point about this is that the process of applying for permission in a Member State is described as a registration procedure but has in practice degenerated into a licensing procedure. The supervisory authorities are not applying uniform standards and there is insufficient communication between them, resulting in uncertainty, wasted time and needless additional expense for the industry, whereas a ‘regulator to regulator’ procedure would be the proper solution in a genuine internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the matter of the simplification of prospectuses. The Commission’s recommendation on this has been implemented in different ways from one country to another, so that, today, depending on the Member State in question, simplified prospectuses are either slim brochures or weighty tomes with different information in them, most of which is completely beyond the consumer’s comprehension. What is needed is for a simple and harmonised prospectus, of between two and three pages, to be developed as quickly as possible and made uniformly mandatory right across Europe, and the industry itself will benefit by being required to supply the same information in every country – in, of course, in each country’s language.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, one has to consider cross-border mergers and pooling, an area in which the considerable fiscal obstacles that still remain need to be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth issue is that of fund processing, in respect of which the industry is making promising efforts, and so we should place our trust in it and take it as read that it will sort out the problems on its own initiative. The Commission appears to concur with this view.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that corrective measures in these five areas will, relatively quickly, help to make the internal market work. What will also have a positive effect will be the industry’s own initiative and improved interaction on the part of the interested parties, particularly of the supervisory authorities. The Lamfalussy principle should apply to those areas of the directive that are amended in order to achieve flexibility and facilitate adaptation to rapidly-changing markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, for some considerable time, been considering whether the directive is capable of being adapted to market changes by means of individual measures or whether it is necessary to adopt a fundamentally new directive. The conclusion I have come to as rapporteur is that producing a completely new version of a horizontal asset management directive with full Lamfalussy applicability would be a major project demanding many years of work, and that such a waste of time is something we cannot afford and should not embark on.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs discussed on three occasions, one of them, indeed, being in the context of an extended exchange of views. The numerous amendments – amounting to some 150 – have been reduced by means of a series of compromise amendments, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the whole report with only one vote expressing dissent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by tabling its Amendment 6, is now jeopardising the compromise we have achieved; doing such a thing would, I believe, make a nonsense of our own-initiative report and show this House as incapable of making a constructive contribution even after long debate. We are not, today, starting from the ground up. UCITS are brand products – with room for improvement in them, it has to be conceded – but the industry is strong, with some 450 million potential consumers and unnumbered thousands of people working in it. These people are citizens, and we in this House have an obligation to them. I therefore propose voting against the Socialist Group’s amendments, particularly against Amendment 6. If – contrary to expectations – a majority is found to support it, then we would advise the plenary to throw out the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with this and with the prospect of profound change, does the UCITS Directive offer an adequate framework for the continued success of the European fund market? This, without a doubt, is a crucial question for policymakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Much lip-service has been paid to the need for a vibrant and dynamic asset management business to provide a secure and profitable home for long-term savings of European households. Now is the time to start translating these fine words into action.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is a very incisive and balanced assessment of the main challenges before us. It clearly identifies the challenges that need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission subscribes to the vision that informs Parliament’s report, namely to build on the solid foundations laid down by the existing directive and not to jettison product harmonisation. This has served us well to date. We need to try to make it more relevant to context of modern financial markets. The work of the Commission and the Committee of European Securities Regulators on the clarification of ‘eligible assets’ is vital in this respect. A draft proposal for implementing legislation will soon be communicated to Parliament. This is serious and promising work. Let us give it a chance before reading the last rites to product harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond better implementation of existing rules, there will be a need to give those involved in the fund industry greater freedom of movement to enable them better to exploit commercial opportunities of the integrated fund market. The emphasis should be on concrete, sensible, targeted changes, based on close contact with the market and informed by a strong commitment to making markets work for the end investor.</p>
<p class="contents">Many important improvements can be introduced without taking an axe to the UCITS Directive. The report provides a very clear steer on the areas where change can be most beneficial: simplification of the notification procedure; measures to facilitate cross-border fund mergers and pooling. The onus will now be on the Commission to come forward with solutions. Where legislative adjustment is needed to give effect to new single market freedoms, these changes could incorporate the possibility for adoption of technical implementing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Another theme that features strongly in the report is regulatory arbitrage between different families of investment products. We do not have the full picture yet. We need to recognise the existence of different institutions and risk features. However, we have to monitor carefully how different products are sold to retail investors.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads us to the disclosure area. I take note of the strong message from the European Parliament on the simplified prospectus for UCITS. We should not conclude that the experiment has failed and that we should move on. On the contrary, the fund market has become a more diverse and complicated place. There is an even greater need for effective and comparable risk and costs disclosures. We take to heart the strong message of the European Parliament on this issue. We will try to remedy the shortcomings of the simplified prospectus.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the UCITS box, we are looking at some of the new asset classes: private equity and hedge funds. These are increasingly powerful players in European financial markets. They are driving change right across the investment fund industry as traditional fund managers learn from these techniques and strategies. We do not need an EU overlay to national regimes for the oversight of these industries. However, we need a sophisticated regulatory engagement with these important players. We need to understand the context in which they operate and whether there are useful improvements that can be made to help them to operate in the European environment.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we move on from here? We will give the fullest consideration to the views set out in Parliament’s report. We will critically analyse the forthcoming recommendations of industry expert groups on alternative investments and efficiency enhancements. We will continue to test different scenarios for UCITS revision from a cost-benefit perspective and we will reach a firm view on the types of improvement that are most urgently needed. This will be presented in a White Paper to be published in the autumn, accompanied by a comprehensive impact assessment. We will immediately set about translating these ideas into concrete initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the UCITS Green Paper and the responses to it – including Parliament’s report – have underlined the importance of measured but effective action in this area. This debate and the follow-up actions have helped to clarify where further action at EU level will be most useful. We are now well poised to begin the task of translating these ideas into effective solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first consists of assessing the proactive role played by the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) in the construction of a single market for financial services, a goal which has yet to be accomplished. The second involves taking account of the now crucial role of collective management for all customers of financial services, which means virtually every EU citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">European legislation on investment funds has been in place for over 20 years and has proved its worth. We have a ‘product’ label that is recognised both at European and world level, and our task, above all, is to ensure its implementation. Furthermore, it is not so much the current legislative framework that is causing most problems, but rather the differences between the Member States in their interpretation and implementation of the directives. Given that the Commission is well aware of where the problem lies, I am amazed that it has not used its powers to ensure appropriate transposition of the legislation, not least where the effective functioning of the sector is hamstrung by unsavoury protectionism. Commissioner, you were right to acknowledge that the ball is in the Commission’s court. I would also call on the regulators meeting in the Committee of European Securities Regulators to take immediate action in line with the 2001 directives and not to wait for changes to the law.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I am not opposed to development per se. The rapporteur has explained that several amendments of a legislative nature need to be made. These concern, for example, a new simplified notification procedure, the simplified prospectus and the cross-border use of pooling techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the issue of the European passport, the report supports the principle of the passport for management companies, but believes it would be premature to do likewise for the function of depositary. Which brings me to a crucial point. An essential prerequisite of all advances in the field of passports is a monitoring system that is accurate and universally accepted. How can risk-free monitoring of a body established, say, in Ireland or London and whose funds are deposited in Luxembourg be arranged? At the first sign of trouble, you will see that nobody will feel fully responsible if the monitoring architecture does not specifically establish responsibilities. In this regard, the system of delegation still has a bright future.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of eligible assets, I am of the opinion that one must be open to products developing on the market but that one must never lose sight of the fact that investors must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to finish by expressing my support for the rapporteur’s remarks about the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. We shall not be voting in favour of those amendments, and I regret that all of our efforts to reach a workable compromise were not accorded the value they merited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you are no doubt aware, Commissioner, we are in a sector that has its own geography because asset management involves UCITS that are produced in some countries and used in others. What we have, in other words, is a market with importing countries and exporting countries, and this is an important factor in how both sides might approach this work. Let us not overlook the fact that this work has a purpose, albeit an increasingly complex one, and that is without doubt the most important factor in our meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">UCITS are products that in some respects were designed for a broad range of savings, that is to say, for small and large investors. The danger is that the proposal now before us will make this investment product more complex and will not necessarily provide it with measures to ensure better protection for investors. Given that problems of mis-selling, to use a nice French expression, have come to light in several EU countries, damaging investor confidence, we must at some point, here or elsewhere, match the more complex nature of investment products with greater protection for investors, whoever they may be. This is the thrust of one of the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and I hope it will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group attaches vital importance to the simplified prospectus, because we believe that it is an essential prerequisite for the effective implementation of a ‘product’ passport.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, finally, to say a few words about supervision, as we are in a field in which the absence of a European regulator constitutes a major source of difficulty. This is what makes the circulation of UCITS difficult, because there is mistrust among regulators. What are needed are a restoration of confidence levels among national regulators and, more to the point, a European regulator with greater powers. I realise that, by saying this, I am already going beyond the scope of today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying a few words about the work to be done. As far as we are concerned, this should be a two-stage process. There are some things that we need to do straight away, such as broadening the basis of eligible assets. Thought also needs to be given to the role and responsibilities of the various actors in this branch of activity of importance to the integration of the EU's financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I believe competition policy is very important and would like to discuss matters which are extremely important from a competition point of view – financial asset management.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to say that financial asset companies are broadening their activities in the new countries and we are getting to the stage where the products being sold are very similar. It is unclear why one product or another is being sold. One can only assume that there are certain agreements between the financial asset managers and the distributors of those assets. However, it would be better if this was expressed in a clear manner and the relationships were revealed to see if these services are being paid for, so that the consumer would at least know that he/she is being offered certain products because a commission is being paid for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is related to the evaluation of market analysis expenses. At the moment, financial asset managers are selling their services together with financial analysis and it is unclear to the consumer whether that analysis really was undertaken, what it includes and what its true price is. Pension funds or an ordinary retail customer can evaluate the expenses and choose a better asset manager when these expenses are fully revealed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to the fact that financial asset companies should not be burdened with unnecessary restrictions. It is often difficult for financial intermediaries working in small countries to avoid conflicts of interest. And the requirement to simply reveal that conflict of interest helps neither the consumer, nor the financial company, as the consumer does not understand what is being revealed and the company has to fill in additional documentation in order to explain. In truth it would be better if a conflict of interest was appropriately managed and it is important to guarantee this legally.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem being encountered, as the Commission Member mentioned, is that various companies are selling various retail savings products. Let us say, insurance companies and financial asset management companies are now selling very similar products. However, financial asset management companies have to reveal a lot of information, whereas insurance companies reveal far less. At times, the consumer is given the incorrect impression that insurance company products are cheaper or better. I believe that this area also needs our attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, we need to work towards a genuine single market for investment products. Second, we have to make the European investment fund industry more globally competitive. To this end, there are highly useful recommendations in Mr Klinz’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible introduction of a harmonised, simplified prospectus across the EU, which would make it possible for investors to compare products easily, is one worth mentioning. As you have already mentioned, Commissioner, unified provisions on eligibility of assets is another. Simplified notification procedures; enhanced cooperation between regulators upon receipt of a notification in the country of origin; mutual recognition of product passports: the list goes on and on.</p>
<p class="contents">Asset management is a key tool for Europe to be able to fund its soon-to-be-explosive pensions situation. The ongoing industry work towards integration, consolidation and dismantling the barriers to cross-border business should be backed up by effective and coherent action by national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the line taken in Mr Klinz’s report in favour of greater industry initiatives for creating an operational and consistent European model of fund management, to be backed up by regulatory convergence when necessary. Using existing powers under EU competition policy, rather than starting from scratch with a whole new regulatory framework, would seem to be a better way to police the market environment, which currently suffers from differences in national interpretations of key provisions of the UCITS Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word about the Directive on markets in financial instruments: MiFID regulates an important part of asset management business, namely the acceptance and execution of orders in connection with undertakings of collective investments. Best execution requirements for asset management are distinct from those of the brokers, and this should be recognised in the Commission’s implementing measures currently under review by the European Parliament and the European Securities Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although Mr Klinz’ report does a splendid job of listing what these are and gives a good overview of the diverse forms of business and products that asset managers and their marketing companies offer and sell to an ever larger customer base, it is nevertheless the case that the lack of rules on supervision and transparency in this field encourages dubious practices. I find hedge funds, too, objectionable as a standard format for use by investment funds until such time as all the European supervisory authorities have agreed on rules to limit the risks involved in them. Since funds of funds and venture capital funds, by definition, spread risks, I believe that they should be permitted subject to the risks being limited by EU-coordinated supervision. The planned introduction of an EU-wide passport for asset management companies and of the EU passport for securities firms will make for more competition in cross-border business activities, and so, of course, the protection of asset management’s consumers and investors will become ever more important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I find it regrettable that my amendments relating to operational risks, which would have made corporate governance rules mandatory for certain limited liability companies engaged in management and marketing, have not been adopted. The demand for sound national consumer protection rules to prevent the distance marketing of financial services from degenerating into unfair competition and misleading advertising has also been rejected, and that, too, is a shame. Not least, my demand for the mandatory provision of information prior to contracts being signed, and the amendments relating to the protection of investors, have been reduced to lowest-common-denominator compromises: what a pity, for a bit more would have been an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me on to another issue to bring to the attention of Mr Klinz, whom I have experienced as much more amenable to dialogue in other contexts, but who has rejected outright the one amendment from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that had to do with comitology. If we were thinking in the longer term, that would be one issue on which we ought, even now, to be much closer to one another; perhaps we should talk a bit more about it, for we do, after all, still have until tomorrow to do so, but it is a pity, for the EU, being the world’s greatest single source of legislation on financial instruments, could play a leading role or at least ensure a level playing field in the EEA (European Economic Area) – here, too, a bit more would have been an improvement. We are, after all, not meant to be making policies just for the well-off; the others matter too, so let us be flexible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a clear statement of priorities and represents a realistic blueprint for driving forward improvements in European fund markets. It is a powerful reminder that the end goal is to deliver sound and attractive investment propositions to European retail investors.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the vision of an efficient and innovative fund industry that is attuned to the needs of its traditional retail investor base. We also agree on how best to achieve that: through concrete, sensible, targeted changes based on close contact with the market and informed by a strong commitment to making markets work for the end investor.</p>
<p class="contents">To touch on the points raised by Mrs Lulling, we have an existing legislative framework and we will ensure that it is implemented properly. Let us build on that rather than tear up the existing rule book. This does not mean that we are settling for second best. There is a lot that we can do through targeted and calibrated adjustments to the existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This work will have a dual focus. First, we need to give investors the means to make informed choices between the best available products. European investors should not be denied access to technical, complex but sound products that are coming onstream. What matters is the way in which funds are sold to the end investor; that there is effective and comparable disclosure of costs and risks; and that intermediaries respect clear obligations when recommending funds to potential retail clients. In this regard, I take note of the strong message from you on the need for significant improvements to simplify the prospectus. We are already giving some thought as to how we can rectify the failings of the simplified prospectus.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second focus must be on the supply side of the market. We need to look at how we can better use single market opportunities to bring down relatively high costs in the European fund industry. I am pleased to note the broad consensus between the Commission and Parliament as regards the main bottlenecks to efficiency gains in the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report confirms the importance of measured but effective action in this field, and the Commission will now define the practical steps that are needed. Our White Paper to be published in early November will define the steps needed to translate our shared ambitions for this important pillar of the financial sector into reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
