<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Plooij-van Gorsel (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, never before have I spoken for so long in Parliament. You may go for a nap in between because eight minutes really is rather long.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is now almost a year since it was agreed during the European Council in Lisbon that the European Union wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and this Parliament rallied around that goal with a large majority. If the European Union wants to achieve this goal, then more investment in research, technological development, innovation and education is essential, both in the Member States as well as at European level. The creation of a European Research Area is vital to this. European research has proved a success: and the innovative efforts of Europe's businesses are also impressive, accounting in the first half of the 1990s for 33% of turnover. The European Framework Programmes of research and technological development have definitely contributed to this as well. The success of the Framework Programmes must therefore be retained in the future and that will also have to be demonstrated when the proposals for the sixth Framework Programme are discussed. But at the moment, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question of having one European research policy. The proposals made by Commissioner Busquin in order to actually bring such a policy about were well received by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but on a number of points we still have a few gaps to fill and some concerns to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of creating an effective research area would be to ensure more cooperation on the basis of more Community objectives and flexible use of resources. Let us do away with techno-nationalism. The research policies of the Member States and that of the Union are currently pursued alongside each other without forming a coherent whole. In addition, we invest significantly less in research than the United States and Japan. These two factors mean that the ground lost to the United States has simply increased in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">In my first report on the European Research Area, I also went on about techno-nationalism, which has to vanish. Greater cooperation is needed between the Member States, researchers and research groups, but also between companies, universities and public research institutes. More coordination at a programme level is also necessary. There is a need for new forms of European cooperation, namely intermediary cooperation, or in other words between national research institutes as well as between the establishments which subsidise research in the Member States. But, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in Europe will stand or fall with a state-of-the-art infrastructure. It is vital to extend a high-speed trans-European research network with a capacity of ten gigabits to a hundred gigabits in the future, in order to achieve a European Research Area and enable it to perform optimally. Only then will we also achieve cooperation such as that between centres of excellence. This goal will never be reached with the SEAN project, which is based on an increase of two gigabits per second per year. I therefore call upon Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin to show much more ambition in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the creation of a European Research Area, we also have need of a European Educational Area, since a dynamic knowledge-based economy, which was talked about so much in Lisbon, requires not only high quality education at the same level in all Member States, but also mobility amongst researchers and students. Greater harmony between higher education and researcher training is necessary as well. I would like to hear the Commissioner's point of view on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements reached in Nice concerning flexibility, variable geometry, or cooperation between a limited number of Member States in the field of research, create an obstacle for the Industry Committee. This forms a central part of Commissioner Busquin's plans. The Industry Committee expresses the strongest possible reservations concerning this cooperation between Member States, particularly if it involves spending European research funds. As it so happens, the Research Committee, this Parliament in other words, has the power of codecision where research at European level is concerned. If this brings about cooperation between the Member States, whereby the Member States finance this themselves, then there is no problem at all. But as soon as European funding is put into research from which only a couple of Member States profit as a result, then the codecision procedure will indeed have to be retained. That is laid down in the Treaty. That is why I would like to see the details of these plans take on a clearer shape, although we are definitely not opposed to more cooperation – because for all that, I have also said: let us do away with techno-nationalism – but as soon as European funding is in the picture, Parliament's power of codecision remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of research. In the fifth Framework Programme we argued in favour of spending at least 10% on small and medium-sized enterprises within the thematic programmes. That was successful too. It appears that even more funding is going to small and medium-sized enterprises from the Fifth Framework Programme. In my report for the Industry Committee, we established once again that at least 10% must be spent on SMEs. Nevertheless I believe that having regard to current spending we can well afford to be a bit more ambitious, so I put it to you that in the coming Framework Programme the amount should be increased to 15% and, of course, I welcome your views on this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, Mr President, relates to an issue about which there is considerable doubt in Parliament and that is nuclear fusion research. Essentially, Parliament has very little to report on this, except that we do have to make the budget available. We were surprised, therefore, that you went to the Council to ask for their opinion on what should happen now with fusion, even before you made a statement yourself which would normally go to the Council and Parliament at the same time. I think that that is a slight reversal of the procedure. We hope therefore that you will ask our opinion on this as well and indeed also give an opinion on the budget that you would like to have seen, but we shall have to approve that first. So in fact we are asking to be fully involved in determining the policy regarding fusion research, as well as in determining the direction that it should take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How utterly astonishing, then, that every country in the world and every Member State of the European Union wastes half of its most valuable resource, that is, the brain power of its citizens. It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are not encouraged at school level, they face discrimination in their careers, and this is something which we have to tackle in the European Research Area. I congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, the rapporteur, and Commissioner Busquin, both of whom have realised the importance of this gap. I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Busquin has upgraded the work of his directorate-general in this matter to the status of a unit, that he is ensuring that statistics are being kept, and that networks which help and encourage women scientists are being supported by the European Union. This must be a key part of the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, as the phrase goes, research by women, for women – so that the gender implications of the research we undertake are examined – and about women. It is important that the socio-economic aspects of the research programme concentrate on gender matters. Why is it that almost every country in the world wastes the brains of half its population by not encouraging them?</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her support of the Committee on Women's Rights' opinion and look forward to the gender perspective being an important aspect of the European Research Area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that the report takes these questions on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which unanimously adopted a report, part of which has been incorporated into the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; I want to emphasise the word "part".</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I am very glad that the human and social sciences will henceforth be regarded not just as a means of research but also as an end. The issue of women is part of the question, but, of course, today we are discussing something much wider. The fact that human and social sciences are now becoming a field of research in their own right means that we have reached a turning point in research in Europe. I think that needs pointing out. Perhaps it will help us think about how to achieve the political and cultural integration of Europe, given that research is an element of this integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also struck by the emphasis placed on the extent to which the new technologies, which are so important today – we discussed that yesterday, in relation to copyright – promote cultural diversity through the question of languages. That is another point we in the Committee on Culture consider extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Sixth Framework Programme, I am pleased to see that the research on cultural identity that we proposed has been incorporated into the report that the Committee on Industry adopted. I hope the Commission will also take this into account. I think it is important to have the possibility of carrying out research on cultural identity, as it is to renew some of the key actions of the Fifth Framework Programme, such as 'multimedia content and tools' and 'city of tomorrow and cultural heritage'.</p>
<p class="contents">I somewhat regret, however, that the Committee on Industry has not incorporated our opinion on Internet costs. Research on Internet costs could have made it possible to reduce them and finally make the Internet more democratic. As for networks of excellence, that is all very well, but we can also, within the European Research Area, create networks that are not just networks of excellence. That is something we also need for the sake of mobility but also for the sake of research itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, of course, there is the question of intellectual property. It could be a great help to Europe in safeguarding its cultural identity and democracy if research were carried out on the technical aspects of intellectual property rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must reiterate what a pleasure it has been to work with her on these matters. Likewise, I should like to express our sincere appreciation to Commissioner Busquin for his constant readiness to take our contributions on board. His door is always open, he is increasing his contacts with the groups and we are grateful to him for that. I do not believe it is an exaggeration to venture to say that as regards working with Parliament his conduct has been exemplary This bodes very well for the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union is not the product of constructivist rationalism, of enlightened tyrannical elites who impose themselves on the people. Rather, it arises from the very promising idea of working together. If there is one area where the European Union was in need of stimulus to integrate policies, broaden the area of cooperation, coordination and synergies, it is the area of research, development and technological innovation. Consequently, the European Research Area is one of the key concerns of the present College of Commissioners. Commissioner Busquin is to be credited with launching and developing such an ambitious idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Area does in fact introduce new and potentially very beneficial instruments. Examples of these are cooperation and coordination regarding the research policies of Member States, concentrating on a small number of promising priorities, exploiting to the full the concept of added European value, the notion of large scale projects and of networks of excellence. There is no doubt that if proper use were made of these instruments they would all play their part in improving the quality and competitiveness of our system of research, development and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our amendments arose out of a number of concerns. To give you some examples: to facilitate the movement of researchers, which we consider essential, to ensure openness and cross-fertilisation amongst the research systems of the Member States, to improve basic research and to establish clearly the criteria which will allow us to set priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Area creates new expectations and is a source of great hope for us all. We wish you success, Commissioner, because your success in this field will be Parliament’s success and the European Union’s success too. Rest assured: as you move forward along the route you have presented so enthusiastically, you will find us marching shoulder to shoulder with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Desama (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the European Commission presented its first communication on the European Research Area, through the intermediary of Commissioner Busquin, we wondered whether this was just another gadget, the kind of publicity stunt the Commission has sometimes favoured, or whether it really did represent a new direction, a turning point in the development of European research. In other words, we wondered whether the Commission was taking on board the fact that strictly Community related research makes up only a small percentage of global research activity in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, after the first communication and, in particular, after this one, which defines the instruments more clearly, we know that we are definitely on the eve of a major change of course in research – although I would not go quite so far as to describe it as a Copernican revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the purpose of research and of its main instrument, the Framework Programme, has been to keep European industry competitive. Today, obviously without neglecting that fundamental objective, we feel that there is a higher ambition, a new dimension. It is clear that if we want to achieve this European Research Area, which corresponds to a genuine Community policy, cooperation with the Member States is absolutely essential. In that respect, I do not agree with Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, even though I find her report quite excellent. I think we must not be overcautious. The Heads of State knew what they were doing when they incorporated that form of cooperation into the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. We must make that cooperation strong and vigorous. I believe it is an essential element and one that must form the basis of the ideas and proposals in the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must embark resolutely on this cooperation, but without forgetting that, in itself, that will not be enough to create a European Research Area. We will have to invigorate the European Research Area by making new efforts to promote the mobility of the researchers, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca so rightly said. We must also invigorate it through joint efforts in the field of major infrastructure. We must also, of course, invigorate it by setting up networks of research centres, whether or not they are networks of excellence, but it is true that we have centres of excellence and they will have to get used to working together. Here you face a formidable choice, Commissioner, in regard to charting these centres of excellence. These days, one could no doubt call it a benchmarking exercise. To call it so is one thing, to make it so is, of course, another, more difficult thing. However, when all is said and done, we have confidence that you will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that over and above the European Research Area, which I believe will be a structural component of the next Framework Programme, we will also have to create links between the research areas and the whole field of university education. That is another dimension, but it is a crucial one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are grateful to him for that and I want to congratulate him personally, just as I want to congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel on the excellent report she has drawn up on the subject. Of course, we are in favour of this idea, and we would like to point out the aspects that the Group of the Verts/ALE considers most important.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must move towards closer European integration in research. We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Point two, this European Research Area must focus on sound basic research carried out by public establishments and it must be accompanied by a European innovation area that is geared to enterprises, be they large, small or medium-sized. At each step, we must try to create a real European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, we must also consider introducing new tools. It is clear that the Sixth Framework Programme we are beginning to work on is the most important one. We must renew it and make it more accessible, more flexible and more legible. We must look into the idea of integrated programmes, of networks of excellence, but, at the same time, we must not forget the smaller entities, which can act as sources of discovery and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Four, we are aware of the need to develop means of promoting exchanges, such as grants, to invest in young people and to create a balance, giving more time to research.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, we must continue to promote pure science. We would like to see more attention paid to the subject of sciences and society and more support given to the human and social sciences.</p>
<p class="contents">Six, the European Research Area must place more emphasis on sustainable development, by drawing up very concrete research projects, such as projects relating to the environment or to renewable energies. But we are not in favour of the inclusion of military research or research in the defence area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my seventh point, we are paying close attention to the international aspect, which is not just a question of competition with the United States or Japan and which must take account of the candidate countries and the cooperation programmes with the developing countries and the Euro-Mediterranean countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also a desire to make the EU a common scientific area, eventually to become a scientific superpower. In many fields the EU is already a scientific superpower. Not all the results and methods applied become common practice, however, as many large countries appear to have their eye purely on their own national, commercial and military interests. They should be opening up their projects to others more. If that does not happen, the EU will not be a genuine European Research Area, and EU money will be used to finance just the scraps and leftovers, for which there are insufficient national funds owing to the fact that the work is deemed to generally lack importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland we use the expression ‘meaningless research’. That means research that produces results that no one needs, uses, criticises or adds to. The European Research Area must not become an area of meaningless research and EU money must not be spent on financing meaningless research. We have to solve the problem that there is no qualitative monitoring of the use of EU funds in which radically scientific achievements might be appraised. It is to be feared that the use of funds is inefficient in scientific terms. It is possible that a common research centre will mean more bureaucracy than science. For that reason, we must demand that any common research area must be developed according to scientific criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her thorough work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. The report’s only flaw is its call for an alliance between science and the armaments industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination and cooperative arrangements are good, but there should be no anti-competitive assimilation. Subsidiarity defines the limits of the Community’s powers, and those limits must always be borne in mind. Whether the Commission’s ambitious projects are realised will depend on the breadth of vision demonstrated by national decision makers, who must rid themselves of the notion that the awarding of research contracts is a means of subsidising their own national economies. The foremost priority must be to achieve each research aim as quickly as possible for the benefit of the entire European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Union probably have the best training courses for scientists, but sadly they often emigrate to more attractive countries like the United States after obtaining their qualifications. Every effort must be made to keep them in Europe, which is why it is up to us to create the best possible conditions for research activity and thus to make Europe a more appealing option for top researchers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is working resolutely towards high quality research, towards greater recognition of the value of the research profession and towards freedom of research.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of networks of excellence, increasing the mobility of researchers and setting priorities in the neuroscience sector – witness the tragic situation of BSE and Alzheimer's Disease and gene therapy to control as yet incurable diseases – are key parts of the project. I hope that the rapporteur – who has done an excellent job, although the time frames and the deadline for tabling amendments were a question of "blink and you've missed it" – will, together with Commissioner Busquin, accept one of my requests, which is aimed specifically at avoiding the brain drain from Europe to the United States of America and other competitive countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that it is only by means of economic and social incentives, making the research profession more competitive with that of the United States and combining it, as is the case in Italy, with senior management posts, as we do for judges, that we will, at last, be able to attract young people and to offer them a position with a future and profound respect for their dignity and the role of research scientists in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also say to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel that I congratulate her on her work, even though, as she knows, I regret the fact that, for reasons which I believe were often ideological, she rejected out of hand all the amendments I had tabled with the aim of improving the report. I want to tell her that I personally will be more generous than she was when we collectively draft the Sixth Framework Research Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With this document, the European Commission is, in effect, proposing guidelines for future measures to support research prior to the discussion on the Framework Programme for 2002­2006. Among these very interesting ideas, I want to take up one, which is and will be one of the leitmotifs of our debates. It is about the need to concentrate European research activity more closely on a limited series of priorities. The key concept here is that of European added value. I know it will not be easy to define these priorities, but I think European research will have everything to gain if we do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same context, the innovations that will mark the Sixth Framework Research Programme are the networks of excellence and the integrated projects, concepts that are also bound to give rise to wide debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission document also addresses the question of the mobility of students, researchers and scientists. That will be one of the central themes of the Sixth Framework Programme and I know that the Belgian Presidency intends to organise a conference on the subject. I welcome that. I am glad that the role of the SMEs has been acknowledged. I approve the call for the inclusion of the human and social sciences under the Sixth Framework Research Programme. It is vital to hold a debate on science and society now that we are at the beginning of the third millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report establish sound foundations for the major task on which we will be embarking together, on the basis of transparency, which also covers the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion. As rapporteur, I am now available to any colleagues who wish to join me as from this moment on in working on the Sixth Framework Research Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The clear references to strengthening competitiveness, the proposal to compile a list of priorities, the recommendation on reducing the number of priorities in order to focus efforts on smaller research projects, the suffocating controls on every research activity will, if adopted by the Council and the Commission, result in a nightmarish structure which will smother research and researchers, wipe out any freedom in the search for new knowledge and radically change the nature of research as a process of producing new knowledge and as a productive force, especially in countries such as Greece, where nearly all research activity revolves around European funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, linking the European Research Area with security and defence policy, paragraph 28, will encourage the militarisation of research, a highly dangerous move. In addition, the reference to new Member States, paragraph 35, is clearly disparaging, given that most of them have a long history of research. I want to believe that Commissioner Busquin will have the sense to ignore most of the European Parliament's recommendation. Otherwise, as I said earlier, we shall have a nightmarish structure in the research area rather than a European Research Area. Needless to say, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.</p>

I believe that Commissioner Busquin bears a heavier burden of responsibility than anyone else in Europe at the present time. The main objective in the context of the BSE crisis is to restore consumer confidence, which we can only achieve by means of objective research, by means of evidence from scientists that the foodstuffs we consume are absolutely safe. For that reason, I believe that the whole question of BSE, which covers biotechnological and genetic research, is an important and central issue. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I am even in favour of our making a special allocation without delay for BSE-related research, because I believe that research is the only truly important contribution that we can make to the clarification and solution of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, small and medium-sized businesses are one of my main areas of concern, and I can only endorse the rapporteur’s view that we should move from 10% to 15% and that funds should be earmarked for companies with fewer than 250 employees. I would also add, however, that provision should perhaps be made for a second threshold for cooperation between large and small companies, research establishments and university institutes. We should insist that the knowledge of large companies and the research findings of scientific foundations and institutions be passed on to the universities and recycled from there into the business world through incubators in order to create new jobs and new businesses. We know that the market is particularly keen on small and medium-sized businesses that are innovative and produce highly marketable products. We should, however, work hard to shift responsibility for the achievement of the aforementioned aims to the national level, because another aspect of the research guidelines is, of course, the idea of dividing up large projects and making them accessible to small businesses too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say a word or two on Mr Alyssandrakis’ remarks, which invite the comment that, if Greece spent more money on research, it would be less dependent on Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is the problem for many countries in the European Union. They have cut back on their research funding for both large and small projects. European research cannot fill this gap. If we want to have a European Research Area, the EU and the Member States must both play their part, otherwise we shall be faced with an imbalance that we cannot redress.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see the administration of these research projects as a major challenge, especially when we enlarge the European Union. Brussels will not be able to go on administering them in the long run. That is why we should try, perhaps with the budgetary control apparatus, with the Court of Auditors, to develop procedures that will lighten the administrative burden in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the research effort cannot be governed by the principles of prudent accounting. Research means taking risks, and some of these risks will inevitably be financial. The crux of all research activity is the final outcome. The bottom line is the result of the research and not necessarily the financial balance. I should far rather have a successful project on which some losses might have been sustained than a project with a perfect balance sheet but no useful findings.</p>

The unanimity of our general aims, however, does not make them any easier to achieve in practice. The foundations of future research policy are, in our view, concentration of effort, in other words prioritisation, as well as flexibility and coordination.

However, as soon as it comes to putting the theory into practice, questions inevitably start to arise. The devil is not only in the detail. To put it another way, you want a concentrated effort, and indeed we all want to have priorities. So what clearly defined criteria will you be using to set these priorities, Commissioner? All I can say is ‘Have fun!’</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria have never been defined in the proper degree of detail, and both of us, Mr Caudron, have been using the term ‘European added value’ for the past ten years. Is that not so? Neither of us has ever defined what it means, nor have we ever been able to. Enough has already been said about flexibility, but then comes the third point, namely coordination. A European Research Area necessarily involves coordination between the Union level and national research, and here I see party-political differences rearing their heads. How much do we want to coordinate centrally, how much do we want to plan and specify centrally, and how much should be done from below in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity? It will be an absorbing debate, and the political parties are already fuelling it, but we are ready and willing to engage in that debate. Congratulations to the rapporteur – we shall continue our cooperation.</p>

Similarly I would like to thank the Commissioner for a very thorough presentation. These days information is the most important factor in production and what we are calling for is an improvement to the content of processed information. It is in this way different, therefore, from plain information. Technical innovation and technical lead are slowly receding into the background as the importance of content and the content industry is being stressed more and more. We are moving away from a sort of information society hopefully to one of education, culture and values, and these guidelines really do speak of a European Research Area. That, in my opinion, is only right, and they say it will be a way of revising the basic social structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation being as it is, I will make two proposals. As a result of the change already under way, we should create a cluster of projects within the framework of the European Research Area, which would help develop content and the production of content. Europe would have much to do in such a project. Another cluster would be one that revised basic social structures; namely, the globalisation of commerce and communication. This is a major factor in the changes taking place today and an enormous challenge in terms of research. For that we would need a study undertaken, as it affects us all. We need information because commerce and communication have taken the place of politics, measured globally. For that reason, Commissioner, I would hope that the proportion of social research can be increased. Finally, I would like to ask what you intend to do to allow research into globalisation to strengthen and grow and give us politicians more weapons to use in debating this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to fill in an important piece of detail within the framework. The oft-recited Lisbon Summit sets the overall objective of "making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world". The biotechnology industry can make a major contribution to achieving this ambition. It is therefore vital that research in the life sciences is given the highest priority in the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there is much despondency, even despair in certain areas of research. We are seeing moratoria on crop trials and new product approvals; deliberate damage to trial crops; delays in transposing essential legislation; verbal and even physical attacks on healthcare researchers; environmental scare-stories that are unfounded and unsubstantiated; harassment of researchers – even threats to life by animal liberation extremists; and the use of emotive and inaccurate terms such as "Frankenstein foods" by antagonistic spokesmen and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">All these pressures, often exacerbated by weak responses by governments and public bodies, are threatening our ability in Europe to realise the great potential which biotechnology offers us. Certainly, a reasonable level of regulation is necessary but this must be directed towards encouraging rather than discouraging advances. Only within such a positive environment will it be possible to realise this potential and be competitive in the industries of the future, in the agriculture of the future, in the highest standards of healthcare, in our contribution to third world development and the elimination of starvation and disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also say how encouraging I find my relationship with all the Members who are deeply concerned with this issue. They have offered me their contributions, their experience and their advice on how to construct this European Research Area, which, I believe, is widely recognised as an essential political objective for Europe. I would also like to thank Mrs Fraisse and Mrs McNally, representing the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities respectively, for their contributions. Clearly, Parliament's support for this European Research Area is essential if we are to make headway with this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of establishing a European Research Area was accepted at the Lisbon Summit. It has become a political fact. But it is true that much remains to be done to make it a reality, as you have made abundantly clear; in that regard Parliament's proposals are an essential component for creating a dynamic at European level. Let me add that, at the forthcoming Stockholm Summit, we will have a progress report on this concept of a European Research Area. The issue is also on the agenda of the Heads of State and Government who are meeting in Stockholm, where it is one of the aspects to be considered precisely in relation to the objective of creating a dynamic European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few comments on the various points raised in Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report and Members' statements. Of course, I broadly agree with what was said, but perhaps I can be a little more specific on some aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the European Research Area will be created thanks, on the one hand, to the Framework Programme, which is designed to facilitate it, but thanks mainly to open coordination between the Member States and those involved in research. So, if the Framework Programme is an instrument, it will have to be adjusted so that it can help structure the European Research Area. That is what you will find in the new Framework Programme: elements contributing greatly to structuring a European Research Area. Indeed, the five-year evaluation report highlighted the need for this measure and made it very clear that the Framework Programme needed to be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of open coordination, I agree that our role still needs to be defined and the criteria need to be more clearly adjusted. But our role is to facilitate and promote open coordination between the Member States. We must consider how we propose to achieve this. Clearly, therefore, this will be a long-term job, a job that will require partnership between the Commission and the Member States, with support from the European Parliament and support, Mr Alyssandrakis, from the entire scientific community. It is indeed a project that concerns all European scientists. There is no distinction. There are, of course, elements of subsidiarity; there is research that is carried out in the Member States and there is added value research. So we are still far away, light years away, in fact, from the kind of monopoly to which you referred and which is certainly not what any of the Members of this Parliament have in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, we will have to adapt new intervention formulae and, in this context, some speakers, including Mrs Fraisse and Mr Desama, referred to the question of the link with education. This science-education link is very relevant and it will, in fact, be on the agenda of the meeting of Ministers for Education and Science in Upsala. We will be holding a joint meeting between Ministers for Education and Science, an informal Council, in Sweden on 2 and 3 March, on the subject of science, society and education in the sciences; we will also be holding an initial discussion between Ministers for Research on the future Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the new instruments I welcome your support, and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca highlighted the importance of these new instruments very clearly. It is in fact thanks to them that we will be able to act more effectively while also, as Mr Linkohr said, simplifying the management procedures, and therefore avoid duplication. So that is the spirit in which the instruments proposed by the Commission were defined. But I also understand your concern about the need to ensure that these instruments offer equal opportunities for all. They must not look as though they were reserved for one category or another, for one group or another or tailored to any particular group or category. So it is in that spirit that we will need to define the new instruments more precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">On the networks of excellence, I think it is quite clear that this is a crucial point, but I am also aware that we have to agree on the definition of networks with a capacity for excellence. In fact, we should use that term rather than referring to 'giant' centres. These are not 'giant' centres of excellence. They are networks with a capacity for excellence, depending on the subject and field of research. So the objective is to establish virtual centres of excellence that incorporate the capacity for excellence in the priority areas. It follows that this is certainly not intended to be a tool, amongst other things, for the small and medium-sized enterprises and the countries that are least developed in terms of research. There are centres of excellence in all the European countries, based on the criteria, which we will be discussing, of the European added value of the programme. That is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in passing that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel was quite right in what she said about infrastructure. As you know, we have already tried to establish an infrastructure with the GEANT programme and to reconcile the infrastructures of all the European countries, with the aim of attaining a capacity of 10 gigabits. But, as she pointed out, we will have to achieve 100 gigabits, so the infrastructure programme will give priority to encouraging coordination between the Member States, since they have to make the effort on their own territory. We will be discussing that priority when we come to the new Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Variable geometry, or what has been called improved cooperation, is evidently one of the issues that raises questions, since Article 169 of the Treaty provides for it but it has never been implemented until now. That is why a very major debate is being held on this issue, which concerns efficiency but is also an institutional matter. We therefore believe that it is up to the Member States to take the initiative. We can only make proposals on the participation of the Union if we have real participation by the Member States. But I agree that we must ensure that this instrument does not discriminate against certain Member States and that Parliament is fully involved in the major decision making in this field. We will have an opportunity to discuss this in greater detail when we come to consider the proposal for the Framework Programme. It will be a major theme of that discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on priorities and criteria, I believe we have outlined the general criteria to illustrate the priorities set out on an indicative basis. These criteria draw on the replies we received in a wide-ranging opinion poll of all those involved in research, which we ran on the Internet throughout the year 2000. We consulted a wide range of scientific and industrial groups on these questions via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This showed that there are clearly three major subjects that are guaranteed to produce added value. They are: everything concerned with post-genome research; the information society, together with the cost of the Internet, which is an essential factor of democratisation; and the question of the nano-technologies and advanced materials and processes.</p>
<p class="contents">These are three important subjects, without forgetting questions of food safety, which is, of course, very much on our minds in Europe today, the quality of life and sustainable development. These will indeed be discussed in the communication the Commission intends to draft in preparation for the Gothenburg Summit. It will discuss sustainable development as one of the key lines of research in the field of the environment, energy and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">On SMEs, Members are clearly right to emphasise their importance. Initially, it was said that at least 10% of the appropriations under the Fifth Framework Programme should be allocated to the SMEs. It seems we are now moving towards a more ambitious target and we might be able to argue for 15% in the next Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now tell Mr Caudron that European added value is clearly the key component. How should we define it? I think it should be defined according to the research projects in question. The concept of European added value is not a global one. It is defined according to the subject of the research, which must be carried out at least at European level if it is to match up to world competition.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of nuclear research, I have no objection, quite the contrary in fact, to Parliament being widely involved in the discussion. You referred to the meeting on nuclear fusion. Let me point out that it was in no way a formal meeting but simply a question and answer session on a document, which is, in fact, accessible and which sets out the four possible options in regard to fusion. I think we cannot avoid a debate on this question. Indeed, it has already been discussed in earlier debates on the previous Framework Programmes. I, personally, am in favour of an open debate on this subject, because it is a fundamental social issue, an entirely legitimate question.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and society, young people and society: that is clearly the subject of the follow-up activities of the Helsinki Group we set up to look at the position of women in the sciences, both in the public and private sectors. Clearly there is also the question of international cooperation. There is that international dimension: the role that Europe plays in the world in relation to research and to serious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and so forth. We have drafted a communication on development with my colleague Mr Nielson, which will be on the Commission's agenda next week. The international dimension must always form part of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I have spoken at great length, but this was an opportunity for me to spark off some debate on the forthcoming Framework Programme, which will probably be adopted in the next few weeks, or even next week. That would allow me to come and present the broad outlines of the new Framework Programme in about a fortnight's time, as a follow-up to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report. Let me close by once again thanking her and all the Members for their contributions.</p>
