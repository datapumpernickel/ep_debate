That section of the European intelligentsia whose approach is still marked by naïve optimism and which still believes that, after 11 September, we can respond to violence without using violence and to war without using weapons, has spoken out about the conditions in which al-Qa’ida fighters, captured in Afghanistan, were transported to Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us try to imagine what would happen if, in the light of the tragic experience of the revolt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the Americans had not taken all the necessary precautions to enable these fanatical fighters to be safely transported; fighters who, for years, have been trained to seek martyrdom by carrying out acts of the most mindless violence. Had they not been treated in this way and had they simply been collectively transported by aircraft, they would have become unbalanced and uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is going on now in Guantanamo Bay? All eyewitness reports testify that the prisoners are being treated well and that the injured are receiving all the care needed for their recovery. So, why is this urgent resolution now being tabled, given the wave of solidarity that Parliament voiced unanimously after the attacks? The only possible reason is so that we can, in the name of fine principles and grand sentiments, distance ourselves from the war that the Americans are continuing to wage against international terrorism. No, ladies and gentlemen, this war cannot be waged by applying international conventions, which were approved at a time when we needed to protect fighters engaging in traditional battles, and when civilians were not an automatic target, as they are now. The war waged by terrorists against defenceless people renders all the Geneva Conventions null and void. The essence of the war against terrorism resides, first and foremost, in collecting information, the aim being to prevent further attacks by infiltrating groups in order to destroy networks which, as we all know, still exist on our territory and in the United States. This is what the Americans are trying to do at Guantanamo Bay. We can only congratulate them on their efforts. That is why our group will not be associated with the joint resolution tabled by other groups, but we will table our own resolution, which, in essence, calls for a revision of international law so that we can adapt to the conditions of the new era that began in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament cannot demand any less than what is being demanded by various legitimate voices in the United States, at the UN and even in the European Union. By Mr Powell himself, by Mr Robinson, even down to Mr Solana. The world cannot be governed by the law of the Far West, including Texas, or by the customs and habits of the town of Leeds. Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands. Because otherwise we shall end up, Madam President, with a world in which what we see is tragedy rather than cinema.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, and I appeal here also to my fellow Members on the other side of the House, when we rally against the death penalty, we are not defending the wretched crimes of some murderer or rapist. We are defending ourselves, our perceptions and our culture. It is for the same reasons that we are calling for the prisoners at Guantanamo to be treated as required under current international law or even American law, which cannot of course be limited to members of the Taliban who are American nationals. This sort of discrimination is unacceptable even in the jungle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This call comes both from United States society and this House itself, which I hope will adopt the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the al-Qa’ida fighters held at Guantanamo Bay who were taken prisoner in Afghanistan, there are two problems. The first is that of their detention, in that there are disturbing International Red Cross reports on the conditions in which they are being held. The second is the legal status of the detainees: there is some uncertainty regarding this but the fact that John Walker, an American citizen, is being tried by a civil court while the other detainees are being tried by a secret military tribunal is there for all to see. This is unacceptable. General Morillon may well be right when he says that the Geneva treaties need to be updated, in that the Convention provides for the status of prisoner of war but, where such status is uncertain, provision needs to be made for the existence of prisoners of an undeclared war, for there is no reason why they should have fewer guarantees or receive less care in terms of respect for human rights as far as<span class="bold"> </span>detention conditions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also makes the important request that the United Nations Security Council set up a court responsible for Afghanistan, so that both the issue of the legal status of the prisoners and that of the detention conditions can be addressed. In endorsing this request, we will be taking a very sensible step which will also help to advance the fight against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue of how they are being treated has given rise to international concern. We have protested in the European Parliament, and we are not alone in having protested. Most countries – except, for once, Cuba where the base is situated – have in actual fact protested. The fact that there have been no protests in Cuba may possibly be due to the fact that the Cubans are pleased that the focus has been shifted from the way in which they themselves treat their prisoners there, but that is not perhaps a subject for discussion right now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some confusion about the legal status of the prisoners at the base at Guantanamo Bay, and this issue needs to be clarified by a competent court. Such a court could be set up by a UN Security Council resolution. Irrespective of what crimes and evil acts the prisoners at Camp X-Ray may have committed – and which we would vigorously condemn – the prisoners must be treated in accordance with international and humanitarian standards and principles. Until such time as their legal status has been established, they must be regarded as prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="contents">The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Graham Watson, said yesterday in the House that we are actually in favour of a review of the Geneva Convention. It would be good if newer and more modern rules could be established that could be applied to prisoners and to acts of terrorism in situations in which, as Mr Napolitano said, there has been no declaration of war. It would be good if the whole Parliament could support this.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament supports the United States and the international fight against terrorism. We have shown this very clearly through our vote earlier today. When democracies engage in such a fight, they must however show respect for human rights and legal principles. I therefore share the concern expressed by my fellow MEPs where the military courts are concerned. It is unacceptable that just one Taliban – an <span class="italic">American</span> Taliban, John Walker – should be brought to trial before a civil court when others are to be tried before military courts. We require that there be common rules and that everyone be treated in the same way and be given ordinary legal rights and legal protection in civil courts.</p>
<p class="contents">It should nonetheless have been possible to avoid a large part of this debate if the United States had ratified the protocol concerning the International Criminal Court so that there had been a permanent court in which people who had committed acts of this kind could also be brought to trial in accordance with international rules. I would really urge the United States to ratify that protocol.</p>

This is outside American jurisdiction. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the only American al-Qa'ida member so far captured is to be tried in a court in Virginia with full legal representation!</p>
<p class="contents">This military order breaches all provisions for a fair trial as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the US is a party, such as the presumption of innocence, choice of counsel, impartial and timely hearing, and the right of appeal to a higher court. The US Government has introduced a category of unlawful combatants, an unknown term in international law, while refusing to grant the suspected al-Qa'ida fighters and Taliban troops captured in Afghanistan the status of prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="contents">These concerns have been highlighted by renowned lawyers throughout the world, who contest the legitimacy of forcibly taking those now detained in Cuba out of Afghanistan without any extradition order, as well as their status as combatants, and calls for them to be treated as ordinary criminal suspects with all associated rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take into account the fact that some of these people, who are merely suspected of being al-Qa'ida supporters, have been deported from Bosnia to Guantanamo Bay. The reports of ill-treatment of prisoners is absolutely shocking. Nobody can deny what we have seen for ourselves on television, including reports that they have been shackled, hooded, sedated during transfer and their beards forcibly shaved. This sensory deprivation is something that was criticised in Ireland in the past in relation to prisoners in Northern Ireland – even by our own government. Yet everyone is turning a blind eye to what is happening in Guantanamo Bay. We have to speak out in the interests of international justice, respect for human rights and respect for the Rule of Law. America should abide by those international covenants as well. Parliament would do very well to speak out and send a very clear message that we do not agree with the policy they have adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is fully in the interests of Europe's citizens that the American security forces be allowed to interrogate these suspects. This would not be permissible were they classified as prisoners of war under the 1949 Geneva Convention, since POWs are only obliged to divulge their name, rank and number, whereas unlawful combatants – their correct classification, in my view, according to the provisions of Article 4(2) of the Geneva Convention – can be interrogated.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to speakers on the other side of the House that a declaration or non-declaration of war is an irrelevancy under the Geneva Conventions. The US needs to interrogate these individuals as it is an essential part of the worldwide struggle against terrorism. The decision by the US to classify them in this way is, therefore, not vindictive but practical and necessary, but it exposes the inadequacy of the anachronistic international jurisprudence in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is my belief that many of these individuals are so dangerous that they would not have hesitated to attack their own guards. If they became aware that one of their fellow detainees was likely to crack under interrogation, they would have made efforts to kill him as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The only possible alternative – beyond the physical restraints which were placed upon them, both in transit, when they might well have bitten their way through the avionic cables in order to down the planes, and on land – would be the use of high doses of intramuscular tranquillisers which, although effective, would have carried significant risks to the detainees and would have required medical and nursing personnel to accompany them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no evidence that the Americans are treating them cruelly or inhumanely, and we should support them rather than engage in speculative and ill-informed criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is twofold: firstly, as regards what will America do with those it does not file charges against who, if returned to their own countries of origin, may face torture and death for reasons of unrelated Islamic militancy; and secondly, with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution, which suggests a role for the international criminal court, which has yet to get off the ground? Unfortunately, as well-intentioned as this may be, my understanding is that certainly domestic terrorists, rightly or wrongly, are excluded from the Rome Statute provisions, but it may be that international terrorists could fall under its remit. This is not clear at present.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of additional concerns about the ICC, such as command responsibility, which blames military commanders even if they had no knowledge of the crimes committed, and also the fact that amnesties and peace and reconciliation processes would become more difficult to achieve between belligerents.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this whole area of jurisprudence ...</p>

<p class="contents">It is not simply a question of condemning the attitude of the United States authorities, but also of rejecting the shameful comments made in the initial days by the base’s military commanders. Some of them, in very bad taste, showed disdain and racism towards the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">A superpower which is not just a military, but also a civil, power should, in my opinion, set a proper example of respect for human rights, even if two twin towers had been destroyed for each of the 50 states of the Union.

We saw them in Yugoslavia, together with their friends on this side of the Atlantic, killing civilians, flattening infrastructures and destroying the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Barbarianism is a fundamental aspect of imperialism. Mistreating any person is a crime. Mistreating prisoners of war is an even more serious violation of international law. And let there be an end to the discussion as to whether or not the detainees in Guantanamo are prisoners of war. If the Americans were waging war on Afghanistan, then they are prisoners of war. If the Americans were not waging war on Afghanistan, then the detainees have simply been kidnapped. And they have been transferred to occupied territory on the island of Cuba on purpose, as a serious provocation to the heroic people of Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans are making no secret of what they are up to with the backing of their friends, and unfortunately some of their friends are here in this Chamber.

<p class="contents">I have arrived late for this debate, but I have had time to listen to some speeches and I believe we should return to the basic issues. I believe there are three basic issues: firstly, terrorism is the great threat to the Rule of Law and to open and democratic societies today; secondly, the United States and Europe share the same vision, the same social organisation and, of course, the idea that respect for human rights is the very cement of our organisation. Thirdly, we must clearly state that, if the European Union flies any flag, it is the flag of respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, we clearly can and must raise our voices and, rather than ask, say, because asking would mean believing that the prisoners in the Guantánamo base are not being treated in accordance with humanitarian principles and the truth is that all the indications suggest that they are.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to enter into the argument about whether or not the Geneva Convention applies to them. We in the European Union must say that, in the case of any doubt, the principles of the Geneva Convention must be applied, but that the Geneva Convention itself lays down a legal basis to resolve all those issues which may endanger the security of the organisation or the prisoners themselves, while a judicial tribunal establishes whether they have the right to protection under the Geneva Convention or not.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, Mr President, I have the impression that they are being treated absolutely correctly and that therefore this debate is unfocused. This has probably been an error in terms of European public opinion – if not in terms of American public opinion –, a public relations error, because the truth is that it has been the United States itself that has published these photos which so offend our sensibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clearly continue, and we will continue, to be vigilant, but always on the basis of the idea that we are fighting this war together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it to be, above all, respect for constitutional legality. Whatever the temptations to deviate from the path of constitutional legality, the fight against terrorism can only be carried on if the Rule of Law and also, above all, international agreements are respected. The USA, then, should not even give the impression that that it does not regard international agreements, the Geneva Convention, and so on, as binding when it comes to the treatment of terrorist suspects. That is also the reason for our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to say something else. The lady who spoke before me said that Europe and the USA have the same vision. That is, unfortunately, not entirely true, as the fight against terrorism in which the Americans are currently engaged is not, from our point of view, a very effective one, although it is a fight against terrorism which, as such, we all support.</p>
<p class="contents">I might just say that the Americans had a highly ambivalent, not to say, sometimes even tolerant, attitude towards terrorism when it suited them, but, following those first fearful seconds on 11 September, they have, unfortunately, again left the path of multilateralism and of the quest for allies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to defend any of the regimes of North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which differ greatly from each other. Yet this simplistic way of lumping all these regimes together and making them out to be an axis of evil in fact demonstrates that the US government, despite Secretary of State Powell's very honourable attitude, is unfortunately taking an approach that does not effectively combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We know, for example, that there are several groups in Iran that are not very keen on going down the same road as President Khatami, his foreign minister, and his government. We are also aware, though, that there are powerful forces in Iran in favour of going down this road, and I therefore believe that, no matter how unequivocal the fight against terrorism, we have to make it clear to the Americans that their way of fighting goes against constitutional legality and is not very effective.</p>

It takes us back to the suppression of the free expression of opinion during the Soviet era. Hence our criticism of it, for the accusation is still founded on the secret martial laws of the Soviet Union, which are not recorded even by Russia's Ministry of Justice. In them, military personnel are forbidden to talk to foreigners. They cannot even go shopping any more, as for a long time many of the traders in Russia have been from other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have appealed to Mr Ustinov, the State Prosecutor-General, to review this case without delay. We call to mind the case of Alexander Nikitin, whose appeal took sixteen months, especially bearing in mind the fact that Gregori Pasko is extremely poorly accommodated. There are not even windowpanes in his cell, and that in winter. Gregori Pasko does not want a pardon. I wish to point out to the Commissioner that there are remarkable false rumours circulating about that. This is not about an admission of guilt. He is in the right! He is within his rights to use freedom of speech. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner to tell Mr Patten that this topic must at last find its way into the discussions between the EU and Russia!</p>

We are, though, obliged to do the very opposite. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and has a special partnership agreement with the European Union, so, on human rights issues, we must apply stringent standards to this country even if it is a powerful one and partnership with it is in our own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russians signed up to stringent standards when they joined these organisations, and now they must meet them. What has been done to Mr Pasko is therefore wholly unacceptable. Mr Pasko is a person who has acted in the interests of the people of the European Union, Russia, and its Asian neighbours in warning of dangers menacing the Russian people and all of us. As a Russian democrat, as an environmentalist, and as a human rights activist, he deserves our support. He campaigns for freedom of opinion and constitutional legality in Russia, and so, in contrast to those who are trying to silence him, he is a patriot.</p>
<p class="contents">This case in particular, then, obliges us to speak plainly and to demand that Russia's secret laws, martial laws, and military courts should disappear and that Mr Pasko be set free, not by being pardoned, but by the utterly unfair and unjustifiable charge against him being withdrawn. There is one other thing we must say loud and clear. There is a need to create the conditions in Russia for the restoration of nationwide independent media. The closure of TV-6 is a scandal that cries out to heaven, and stands out as the conclusion of a coordinated policy engaged in by the Kremlin and by President Putin himself.</p>

I was very much reminded of this phrase during a recent incident at the Russian Kultura channel. In a programme, the presenter recommended a recently published book on the position of intellectuals under the Stalin regime. He had deduced very subtly that the publishers must have thought the time had come to reflect on almost forgotten survival techniques. This is a discerning way of ridiculing the Kremlin’s authoritarian press policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the penniless directors at TV-6 have little to smile about these days. Last month, their channel was taken off the air by judicial order. In that way, the last, national, private channel, with its own independent reporting, disappeared in Russia. More than half of the Russian population were able to receive the TV-6 programmes. From now on, these citizens will have to rely on the two public channels, ORT and RTR, to provide them with information. In short, the forced closure of TV-6 certainly spells a decline in the Russian press landscape. The present draft resolution is therefore right to point this out.</p>
<p class="contents">Has TV-6’s fate now been sealed for ever? No, for, next month, the Ministry of Press Affairs will decide on a new licence for Channel 6. There is therefore a chance of this independent broadcasting channel being given a new lease of life. Interestingly enough, the day before yesterday, it received public backing for this from the right and the left political opposition camps in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">This option is definitely not the Kremlin’s preferred choice. The leaders in Moscow much prefer the idea of turning Channel 6 into a special sports channel. In their view, this also fits in perfectly with Putin’s new campaign for national fitness. Whether watching television for hours will indeed produce a healthier nation is very much to be doubted. With a view to the desired de-politicisation of society, however, it is an effective instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft resolution also makes reference to the case against the military journalist Grigori Pasko – with very good reason. The obvious link between his case and the closure of TV-6 is that both rest upon a shaky legal foundation, something which is not compatible with the fundamental principle of the Rule of Law in the Russian Federation. This is one of President Putin’s basic principles, which we gladly share with him. Given the expressions of endorsement conveyed by Russian society to Grigori Pasko and the editors of TV-6, there are surprisingly many more like-minded Russians. This sober resolution is a welcome affirmation for them and is designed to ensure that justice prevails for Gregori Pasko personally and that press freedom in general is protected in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two cases involving Grigori Pasko and Igor Sutyagin are more or less identical. Although Mr Pasko was sentenced in 1999, the Kaluga regional court has only recently acknowledged that there was no legal basis for his imprisonment. He is still in prison. This illustrates the Russia of today, Russia under Mr Putin, the Russia of Mr Putin’s friend, Mr Oostlander, who had us vote on a report on Russia – which I voted against – and in which we approved substantial funding of programmes for the media and for freedom of the media, for an independent judiciary and for the protection of the environment. At almost every part-session, however, we have to remark upon the fact that, in these areas and in many others, things in Russia are not working.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the policy of the European Union. In other words, we are funding the fight to protect the environment and, at the same time, we have to fight to have environmental protesters released from prison and so on. This is a ridiculous policy. It is obvious that Mr Prodi’s concerns do not go much further than Gazprom and gas. We all know this and I urge those who tabled texts to include a small oral amendment. I also urge the Commission to express its strongest opposition to the Russian authorities. I do not think that this is a matter for the Council alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on, it is most shameful that we are not spending enough time discussing the situation in Chechnya. Not a day or week goes by, however, when there is not an article on Chechnya in our newspapers. I urge you to read the latest article by Mrs Politovskaya in ‘Courrier International’ magazine. What is happening in Chechnya, which is still part of Russia, even though it should not be, is absolutely atrocious. Of course, there are no pictures like those taken at Guantanamo Bay; there are no pictures but the situation is obviously much worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against the background of our joint efforts with Russia to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has repeatedly made clear that it expects Russia to act in accordance with the values that it committed itself to respecting when it entered the Council of Europe and the OSCE. These basic principles, including free and independent media, necessarily constitute an integral part of our partnership, underlying the strategic partnership that we are building. Besides legal considerations, editorial freedom in Russia has suffered a number of setbacks in recent months. This is a worrying development. In addition, the Pasko case raises concern due to the dim and unclear circumstances surrounding his trial, including the lack of any public incriminating evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">At any rate, we will continue to use all CFSP instruments to support the causes of independent media and editorial freedom in Russia, including by raising all relevant cases in the framework of our bilateral political dialogue with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission will continue to devote special attention to supporting civil society and independent media in the context of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, for which Russia will be a priority in the short and medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is claimed that Mr Ratsiraka has rigged the election results and his intentions remain a mystery. He is not stepping down and his silence is leading to fears of violent actions being carried out by his supporters. Although the Ministry of Home Affairs attributes only a small majority to Mr Ravalomanana, he is claiming to have won the first round and is calling for the second round to be cancelled. However, the official results mean that the two men must face one another in a second round and the international community is hoping and praying that it will be organised. Mr Ravalomanana appears to enjoy the support of the people, as hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in his favour, bringing the country to a standstill with a general strike and claiming victory over the opposition. This strike is having disastrous consequences for Madagascar’s economy, and last week cost between USD 8-10 million. The losses incurred, following 10 days of strike action, have already exceeded Madagascar’s annual education budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no misunderstanding about this. This is not a question of us supporting one candidate over another, and I have no more sympathy for Mr Ravalomanana than Mr Ratsiraka. What could be a cause for concern for the future are his autocratic tendencies, which came to the fore when he was the capital’s mayor, and if elected, Madagascar’s power would be in his hands. Human rights supporters are becoming disillusioned. But what we need, first and foremost, is respect for democracy and the Rule of Law. That is why it is essential that the two candidates agree to the ballot being checked and that the High Constitutional Court agrees to compare the results. This comparison is the only democratic means of establishing the real results of the ballot. The Commission must do everything in its power to resolve this conflict, which is pulling the country apart, but also to help in establishing a genuine Rule of Law. The conflict must be resolved with respect for human, political and civil rights, but also for political pluralism. Respect for fundamental principles is essential in consolidating the democratic process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do feel, however, that we must reiterate the need for transparent elections, for we must promote the development of democratic awareness and culture just as we must promote the growth of civil society.

The slow procedure and the quasi-monarchic nature of the regime that has been in power for almost 20 years, which, in particular, had led Madagascar’s government to refuse the presence of international observers, and the ambiguities found in the public statements made by the opposition, sow more than a seed of doubt as to whether these results are reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">But are Madagascar’s leaders solely responsible for this parody of democracy? Why was this country, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, not the focus of particular attention from international public opinion before these regrettable events occurred? Have the countries of Europe, and France in particular, forgotten the past they share with Madagascar?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Madagascans do not need us to take them by the hand, nor do they need us to make electoral choices on their behalf. However, Europe cannot, under any circumstances, stand aside and do nothing. In spite of the ‘good behaviour’ that the observers have emphasised – which is one of the Madagascan people’s defining characteristics – the situation is exceptional for this country. More than 500 000 people take to the streets every day to demonstrate on a scale that has not been seen since the country gained independence. Madagascar has been brought to a virtual standstill by a general strike that is having disastrous consequences, and the support for which is as strong as ever despite being in its tenth day. We cannot remain indifferent, given the serious nature of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore adopt initiatives to help the people of Madagascar to rediscover a dignified way of life. And this will only happen if the second round takes place in a transparent fashion; in other words, if the international organisation and if the European Union ensure the elections are conducted in the proper manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demand that the two candidates show respect for the Rule of Law and safeguard civil peace so that the electoral problems do not escalate into an ethnic dispute. We must quite simply call for the voice of the people to be heard and for their verdict to be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A tide of intimidation directed at the opposition parties culminated in innumerable violent deaths and mysterious murders. That being so, these elections cannot be described as free in the true sense of the word, even though our colleagues have reported from Cambodia that the ballot itself seems largely to have been conducted in a correct manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, though, register the fact that there is still a great need for democracy to really take root in this country, which has been tested by adversity and has suffered more than any other in the world from the horrors of the twentieth century. No other country in the world has seen a totalitarian rampage such as took place in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, and so the wounds are not going to be healed overnight. We must, though, nonetheless see to it that we apply clear standards and promote democracy and the Rule of Law – and that can only be done through the local communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to the Commission and the Council to systematically promote and support the newly-elected local assemblies, by which I mean not only the representatives of the ruling party but also those of the opposition parties, which must not be allowed to degenerate into fig leaves, but which are needed so that this first tentative step towards democracy may result in real democracy and not just a propaganda show. We therefore need training and development for local politicians; they, their access to the media, and free media themselves, need to be fostered. These need to be the priorities of our future policy on Cambodia. Forces such as Funcinpec, too, as well as others, need to be promoted by us, so that a genuine and stable multi-party system may arise in this country that has suffered so much more than any other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we spent EUR three million in the form of technical assistance to ensure that the recent municipal elections ran smoothly and why we sent observers from the European Union at Cambodia's request. The European Commission coordinated a total of 120 observers in Cambodia on the day of the election. This is the first time we have sent observers for purely local elections. I must say that I was especially pleased that Carlos Costa Neves headed the mission, as this shows that Parliament and the Commission are now working even more closely together on election observer missions.</p>
<p class="contents">According to initial reports, preparations for the elections and polling arrangements went smoothly and voters arrived peacefully and in an orderly manner. We did, of course, receive reports of incidents of violence, murder and intimidation which are giving us serious cause for concern and which took place despite the fact that both the government and the other political parties stated they wanted no violence during the elections. And we consider that media coverage of the elections was biased. As the electoral process has not yet been completed, the results have not yet been announced and accusations and appeals have not yet been filed, it is too soon to draw any final conclusions as to how the elections passed. But clearly, for the first time in its history, the people of Cambodia had the opportunity to vote for local councillors and they turned out <span class="italic">en masse </span>in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission representation, together with European Union diplomatic missions in Cambodia, will continue to monitor progress in the post-election period. Only then shall we be in a position to evaluate the full importance of efforts to ensure that this country continues on the road to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In September 2001, 11 members of the Eritrean opposition, including several former ministers who had published a letter calling for a return to democracy by the ruling party, were arrested by the government. As well as the arrests, a ban, described by the authorities as temporary, was imposed on the private press. The elections were also adjourned and the formation of new political parties was prohibited. Journalists and Eritrean dissident politicians were gagged by the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">These repressive measures, which violate freedom of expression, are worrying and unacceptable. They blatantly contradict the Eritrean authorities’ proclaimed desire to undertake democratic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the expulsion in October 2001 of the Italian ambassador, who represented the European Union on the ground, severely undermined relations with Eritrea.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, in order to enable relations between Eritrea and the European Union to return to normal, it is essential that human rights and fundamental freedoms be respected. For this to happen, the Eritrean Government must not only release all political prisoners and journalists, but it must also lift the ban on all independent journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union must re-examine its relations with Eritrea in the light of the Cotonou Agreement, Article 96 of which calls for an inter-Eritrean national conference to be held, bringing together the various political leaders and representatives of civil society, with a view to finding a solution to the current crisis and to setting the country on the path to democracy and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From 1889 to 1952 Eritrea was under the flags firstly of Italy, then of Britain. It was then given by the international community to Ethiopia in federation, and then it was annexed by that country. It then suffered 32 years of war during which its economy and its environment were ruined and its people dispersed.</p>
<p class="contents">We then came to 1993 and its referendum for independence. I was there as a UN observer. There was a spirit of hope abroad in that country. The refugees were returning, reconstruction was beginning to take place. 90% of people voted in that referendum. 99% voted for independence. President Isaias was elected president. With a moderate lifestyle and a period of optimism stemming from it, we hoped for the best. For some years the problem was border conflict. Now sadly the problem is internal.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights have deteriorated, opposition is not tolerated, eleven former leaders of the government party have been arrested, the press is suppressed and journalists arrested. The Italian ambassador has been expelled. Multiparty elections which were promised for last December were cancelled and now parties themselves have been banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy has been cancelled in Eritrea. Eritrea is desperate for support in rebuilding a country ravaged by war. They need our aid, but aid must not be without guarantees of good governance. To our friends in Eritrea we say: "come back to the world community of democratic government. Turn away from totalitarianism". To the Commission I say: "be firm". Human rights are not just for our benefit. They are not to make us feel good. They are for the benefit of the people of Eritrea and Eritrea needs those human rights now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Eritrean Parliament, which is made up of elected members who all belong to the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, has decided to ban the formation of political parties. The independent press has been suppressed and many journalists, politicians and political opponents, including former government ministers, have been arrested, accused of treason against the national assembly. There is an increase in repressive measures being taken to control the citizens, especially students, two of whom died while imprisoned in the desert. The Italian ambassador has been expelled. The state of the economy and of citizens’ living conditions is becoming increasingly serious. The non-governmental organisations operating in Eritrea report situations which have reached hitherto unknown severity: even doctors, nurses and paramedics have been removed from hospitals and sent to the front, leaving the people with no health care at all. The violence inflicted on the people, particularly women and children, is indescribable.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community cannot just stand by and watch. We need to intervene as swiftly as possible to help define the borders. The UN Security Council and the Algiers Commission have committed themselves to doing this, but we need a European delegation, a troika, to go to Eritrea and we need to reassess relations with this country on the basis of the Cotonou agreements. We need to demand the announcement of parliamentary elections – already scheduled, moreover, for December 2001 – elections which must take place under international supervision. We must demand the release of all political prisoners, and that the freedom of the press, the freedom of association, the freedom to develop society and the freedom to form political parties and trade unions be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">All this must be an essential prerequisite if the Union is to resume the financing which is absolutely vital for the reconstruction of the country’s war-torn economy and for its development. The Council and the Member States need to adopt a coordinated approach to relations with Eritrea which is as effective as possible and such as to contribute quickly to the process of achieving peace at the country’s borders and within Eritrea.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will take place as of mid-March. We hope that, at that forum, we will be able to debate the processes announced previously as having already taken place, and that we will be able to find a way to initiate a peace process with the Eritreans as well, to restore democracy and, most importantly, to restore to the citizens, men, women and children acceptable living conditions which are no longer shameful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Eritrea is extremely critical, and we now have a better understanding of what prompted this people to go to war against Ethiopia. However, the solution reached was not a mutually agreed solution but a concession obtained from Ethiopia, which won the war by military force. Moreover, Eritrea brought down a regional resolution at the ACP Assembly of November 2001 by refusing to discuss the issue of relations between the two States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Italian ambassador, we should ask why he was expelled. He was expelled for the ‘crime’ of conversing with Eritrean civil society rather than just with the country’s leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must be resolute in addressing this situation, first and foremost in order to free the Eritrean people from the ruling power. I feel that maximum effort and total commitment on our part will be needed to bring growth to civil society, to create a world that is civilised and not excluded from the assembly of the civilised nations. That the Commission use the Cotonou Agreement to this end is not just necessary but, given the situation, its responsibility. We cannot allow the situation in this area to persist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is good that issues such as the arrest of political protesters, the electoral law and the bill on political parties have been debated in the long-awaited gathering of the national assembly in Eritrea but we are, of course, sorry that no decision was taken on when detainees will be referred to the courts or released and that the formation of political parties has again been put on hold.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the committee set up to safeguard the future of the press in Eritrea will be able to help get the restrictions on the private press lifted soon. The Commission is working with the presidency and the Member States, so that it can react in a forceful manner to the present crisis. Without question, the whole endeavour is based on international law, human rights and human rights conventions and our efforts will be directed towards making sure that political dialogue with Eritrea continues and is reinforced within the context of article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A visit to Eritrea by the high-level troika is being planned as soon as the report by the Boundaries Commission is published, hopefully within the next few weeks. Because of the tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Commission believes that every effort should be made to prevent the conflict from escalating. And the Commission needs to make an active contribution towards conflict prevention and the restoration of peace and stability in the area. However, we need to tread very carefully and avoid any action which might leave the political leaders in the area with their backs to the wall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
