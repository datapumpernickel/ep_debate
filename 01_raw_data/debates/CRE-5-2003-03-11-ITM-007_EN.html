<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Friedrich (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, this is indeed an important issue. What is at stake, after all, is the stability and development of our single currency, the euro. At present, the voting modalities in the European Central Bank are as follows: we have twelve central bank presidents – or governors, if you will – plus six central bank directors, making a total of 18 votes. That is a relatively small and manageable body. Every member has full and unrestricted speaking and voting rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We can assume that sooner or later, other countries will join as well. I hope that Great Britain will be one of them, but some countries from the Central and Eastern European accession candidates will undoubtedly join too, which means that it is essential to consider how these voting modalities can be amended and adjusted to the new dimension, given that in future, some 15, 20 or 25 countries may be part of the euro-zone. The Council has now asked the ECB to draw up its own proposal on this issue. Under pressure of time, a proposal has been drafted which really is not acceptable. Let me cite just a few examples: it proposes forming three groups of countries, although it is very difficult to explain why any country is in a specific group. I could do so, but it would take about ten minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this system is not remotely transparent, especially since a rotation system would then be introduced. This means that the first group comprising the ‘biggest’ countries would not take part in 20% of the votes, but would take part in 80% of votes. In the other groups, it is entirely possible that a country, that is to say, a central bank governor, would not participate in as many as 40% of votes.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, this could mean that a large country belonging to the first group would look precisely at when it is not entitled to vote, in a bid to influence the agenda and ensure that important items are excluded from the agenda when it has no right to vote. This will mean that there will be massive debates about the agenda. What is more, the details of this rotation system still have to be hammered out by the Central Bank's Governing Council. As we can imagine, it is quite likely that a country which is not entitled to vote will make even greater efforts to influence the voting behaviour by delivering lengthy speeches during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – quite rightly, in my view – has now said that this model is not functional, transparent or efficient for such an important body as the Governing Council. We have also taken the trouble to speak with academics from France, Germany and Great Britain because we believe that the academic sector should have an input here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday, at 7.15 p.m., the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepted my proposal which – without any prior discussion on our part – is also endorsed by many other bodies and parties in this House. We say this: we are not under any real pressure of time! We say this: Let the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, put forward a new and better proposal. It will be 2006 at the earliest, and most probably 2008 – in other words, four years – before any of the new Member States joins the euro. So take time to work out a new, transparent and viable proposal!</p>
<p class="contents">We have presented two options in this context. We have said that even if weighting is needed, there should be no rotation system. Give us a ‘one country, one vote’ system every time, but with a weighting system based on population size, GDP and the relative size of the financial services sector – we were thinking to some extent of Luxembourg here. We have also said that in the long term, you really do need to get down to brass tacks. If confidence in the euro has increased to an adequate extent in a few years' time, the academics' proposal could be adopted. This entails differentiating between short-term operational decisions and long-term institutional/strategic decisions. The short-term decisions could then be taken by the board of central bank directors – currently six, but in future perhaps nine people – while the strategic decisions, such as the overall monetary strategy and monetary policy instruments, could remain the responsibility of the Governing Council as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason – and let me cite the relevant passage in English to conclude my brief speech – we are asking for ‘calls for proposals to be made by the Convention in view of its adoption’<span class="italic">.</span> I just want to say that the ideas I have put forward here have been drawn together in writing as a compromise amendment, for we anticipate that a new proposal – if these principles are accepted – will produce a better voting procedure than the untenable solution which has been put forward at short notice by the Governing Council, and which is not acceptable to anyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall outline our differences with Mr Friedrich’s report and refer also to our final position.</p>
<p class="contents">Any reform of the Central Bank must comply with four conditions. Firstly, decisions have to be taken quickly and efficiently. Secondly, decision-making bodies have to act taking account of the interests of the Eurozone as a whole. Thirdly, the system has to be impartial and fair to present and future Members. Fourthly, the markets and the public as a whole have to be aware of transparency. This is crucial to understanding the operation of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">The model advocated by the Central Bank does help to ensure efficiency. Nonetheless, the key feature of the Central Bank’s proposal is based on the enabling clause in the Treaty of Nice. It is therefore based on the premise that the system legally in force may not be modified. I should like to return to this when I have heard what Mr Friedrich has to say. The Commission is of the opinion that taking the European Central Bank’s proposal as a point of departure, the rotation model may be improved by reducing the maximum number of voting rights on the Governing Council. Such improvement should be substantial. It should involve adjusting the method of classifying countries into groups. There is no need to develop new types of weighting. The Bank’s own classification should be used instead. This takes account on the one hand of population and, on the other, of GDP. Improvements are called for, however, to clarify the frequency and order of rotation in this type of voting. This is the thinking behind our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Having considered the proposals in the report, we believe them to be ambitious, but find they pose a fundamental problem. They envisage interpretations going beyond the enabling clause. We differ on this in two respects. Turning to the most significant first, the report rejects the Central Bank’s model and presents a counter-proposal. The latter is no doubt technically valid, but it is not in line with the enabling clause. The notion of a double key, involving double weighting of the vote, is not in line with the clause either. This is because according to legislation currently in force, every Member of the Council must have a voting right. Such adjustments are therefore better suited to a different context, to a more ambitious position, like the one you yourself referred to, Mr Friedrich.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision we have to take in the near future is whether or not to go ahead, following the accelerated procedure, and adopt the Central Bank’s proposal. A decision must be made within the next few weeks if it is to comply with the enabling clause. Were this to be the case, a unanimous vote in the Council of Ministers would be required. As you are aware, this is still outstanding. Nonetheless, the Commission agrees with the House that a more thorough reform is called for. Such reform should go further than what is envisaged under the enabling clause. We should be prepared to tackle it at the next Intergovernmental Conference on the basis of a different model. As has been rightly pointed out, this can be done at the Intergovernmental Conference, but not under the current enabling clause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Against this background, we welcome the fact that the ECB has put forward a proposal unanimously. We also welcome the fact that a clear political message has been sent that the ECB should in future regulate its decision-making mechanisms itself, and that we do not want to make any special provisions here. There is absolutely no reason why this decision should be adopted hastily, as the rapporteur has already pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">We can continue in familiar fashion and prepare a fundamental reform with the next Intergovernmental Conference. The fundamental reform which is necessary, and which we intend, differs in one key respect. We say: everyone should remain on board; there should be no rotation principle; in a common Europe, everyone should have a say in the ECB. The solution is not rotation but weighting. This weighting could be based on the weighting in the Council, but must build primarily on economic and financial market policy parameters.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than more complexity, we want greater transparency. We do not want new forms of discrimination, but more integration and therefore greater clarity for the public. Take us up on our offer, which is to prepare a comprehensive reform instead of an over-hasty short-term solution! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because it was developed from the perspective of national representation, not a European perspective, that it must be rejected. What we actually need is an ambitious European solution. Here, no Member of this House can be neutral, for the way in which such a key macroeconomic partner arrives at its decisions is important. We must therefore know how the decisions are shaped, but there is still time for that at the next Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifying that representation should be on a national basis conflicts with the aim of an integrated monetary policy. However, I should point out here that when drafting its proposal, the European Central Bank's hands were tied, for the paltry spirit of the Treaty of Nice is also reflected in the enabling clause contained in Article 10.2, and we therefore do indeed need a proposal from the Convention for the Intergovernmental Conference so that a number of issues become clear: should the Executive Board have a special role? Should we differentiate between monetary policy and operational decisions? Where should the strategic decisions be taken? This is possible with a unanimous amendment to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do think it is important for us to make this distinction, simply because it is necessary. As the European Parliament, we also have a particular interest in doing so because we attach importance to transparency. Like our colleagues in the USA, we want to be able to follow how decisions are taken and also how weightings occur in the discussions. In this respect, the difficult proposal by the ECB, which we in the Socialist Group cannot endorse, sends out quite a hopeful signal – for up to now, we have always been told that the outcomes of the votes in the ECB's Governing Council could not be published because no votes take place. I think that in a democratic system, majority voting should apply, and then the voting behaviour of the individual members of the central banks or the Executive Board can also be published.</p>

The ECB proposal would create a third class of Member State with fewer chances of voting and, outrageously, only candidate countries would be in this inferior grouping.</p>
<p class="contents">Tiny Luxembourg gets a special lift into the second group thanks to its financial markets, even though it has had a central bank for substantially fewer years than many of the candidate countries, including Poland and Hungary. This is a proposal designed to protect the vested interests of the eurozone's existing central bankers. They are just trying to pull the ladder up behind them.</p>
<p class="contents">We support instead an Executive Board of nine members, as Mr Friedrich has mentioned, taking operational decisions, plus a wider Governing Council that would involve all Member States' central bank governors in strategic decisions, such as the definition of price stability, and the emphasis on other objectives, such as monetary reference values.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups that the Governing Council should decide by a double majority system, giving more weight to the members from the big Member States, we beg to differ. We support the principle of one member one vote when it comes to decision-taking, and a double majority system implies that a Governing Council member from a big Member State is representing that Member State, rather than voting for the eurozone as a whole. This would be retrogressive and would undermine the collegiate outlook of the Governing Council. However, there should be some checks and balances on the Executive Board, which is why we propose that the Governing Council should be able to overturn decisions of the Executive Board by a two-thirds majority. The Convention should look at this issue so that it can be discussed as openly as possible and with full consultation of all the interested parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The distribution of powers and responsibilities between parliaments, governments and independent authorities – the independence of the European Central Bank is a valuable asset which has worked well and must be safeguarded – does not give independent authorities the power to decide on their working procedures or, as in this case, on changes to the working mechanisms, particularly where it is a question of enlarging a club. It is clear that the current members of the club have presented a proposal which, first and foremost, affords themselves and their prerogatives some protection against the prerogatives of the members who will join the club in the future. It is absolutely obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a serious procedural defect that has led to this situation and to a proposal containing a number of shortcomings, which have already been pointed out by Mr Huhne, who said that the hierarchy of countries is dubious. I hope Mr Goebbels will forgive me if I say, just by way of example, that I too believe that Luxembourg must not have a greater role than Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the presentation of the European Central Bank’s proposal is in line with the Treaty of Nice, which, moreover, stipulated that the Council could decide on either an ECB proposal or a Commission proposal. I believe that we must somehow go back to square one and that the Commission must produce its own proposal, taking Parliament’s recommendations into consideration. The ECB will be consulted, but it cannot be allowed to be the promoter of this decision which concerns it so closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have shied away from it!</p>
<p class="contents">We want the Council of Heads of State or Government to devise and adopt a different model, with other weighting criteria being used in this context. The draft on changes to the voting modalities proposed by the ECB Governing Council and endorsed by the European Commission, is unnecessary and unjust. It is unnecessary because we are certainly not under the time pressure that you, Commissioner, have described. Summer 2006, in a best-case scenario, is theoretically the earliest that we will achieve a figure of 15 eurozone members. We therefore do have enough time.</p>
<p class="contents">With this model, you will create a two-class system among the members of the ECB Governing Council, with the governors of the smaller countries' central banks suffering a severe curtailment of their rights. In a single currency zone, it is essential for every member of the ECB Governing Council to have a permanent and equal vote. To ensure that this is guaranteed in future too, and thus to retain the existing rules, we have proposed that other weighting criteria should be used. Our colleague Dr Friedrich has already spoken about this. My proposal to use population as one of these criteria has not found support among a majority in the committee so far this time. Since the rules have to be agreed unanimously, there will be no movement without a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The rotation system, Commissioner, is a bad compromise. I have proposed that in addition to a simple majority of votes, at least half the population of the Member States of the eurozone must be represented. This will avoid majority decisions being taken in the ECB Governing Council without taking sufficient account of the economic realities in the European Union. Population as a criterion is more appropriate and more representative, for a variety of reasons, than other criteria such as the relative size of the financial services sector or GDP. Current and precise population figures are available for all Member States; they are calculated on a per capita and therefore absolutely comparable basis, and take account of the fact that the primary focus of a rational monetary policy based on the EU treaties must not be on the capital markets, but on the people affected by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Whether within the Convention or in bodies such as the European Central Bank, representatives of the large countries believe they are under threat of being tied up by a gang of small countries, which are by definition irresponsible and which, following enlargement, will form the majority within the Council in terms of numbers. Although it is true that the European Union theoretically brings together States that are equal in rights and duties, some, like George Orwell’s pigs, believe themselves to be more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of the European Union does not provide a single example of an alliance of Lilliputians against the Gullivers of Europe. In fact, every case of obstruction in Europe, from de Gaulle’s empty chair policy to Maggie Thatcher’s famous ‘I want my money back’, has been the work of the large countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact was invented to establish budgetary discipline in the so-called ‘Club Med’ countries in order to guarantee the external value of the euro. The Pact is respected by the small countries, but far less by the large countries. Gulliver’s syndrome, however, leads some capital cities to believe that governors from small countries might be led to impose a lax monetary policy. The result of all these fears is the ECB proposal to restrict the number of governors deciding on monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">President Duisenberg claims that governors do not vote according to their national interests, that there are, in fact, no votes and that monetary policy is decided by consensus. Why, therefore, this proposal to change the voting system? We are told that it will no longer be possible to vote when there are 25 Members. Although a discussion between 25 Members would certainly be longer, a vote for or against a change to key interest rates can take place just as easily with 25 as with 18 or 9 governors.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, therefore, the real reason behind the proposed reform. In fact, the five large States, which represent approximately three quarters of the Community GDP, want to be able to define monetary policy themselves. In this regard, the ECB’s proposal is ingenious, since it would set up a system of rotation between three groups of countries which would ensure that the large countries are able to vote in 80% of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The Friedrich report proposes to restrict monetary policy decisions to an Executive Board of nine Members, which would be selected on the basis of the two-fold criteria of the population of each country and the total size of its economy and the relative size within it of the financial services sector. As regards this latter point, the Friedrich report is in line with the unanimous proposal of the Governing Council. However, there are still some doubts in relation to all these proposals. As this is not a matter of urgency, why not grant us an additional reflection period?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to respond to Mr Della Vedova that, according to the ECB proposals, Poland would still be ahead of Luxembourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Friedrich’s report is along the right lines but, in common with others in Parliament, I wonder why there is all this hurry. We should stop and reflect and produce a securely founded proposal for the next intergovernmental conference. It is a requirement of democracy that voting rules be fairly simple and comprehensible. Ordinary people too must in fact be able to understand them and how they work. The principle should be one of ‘one member, one vote’.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Huhne pointed out, the important requirement of efficiency can be met in an enlarged EU. Commissioner, we must prevent an unduly divided Europe. A division into A, B and even C teams is not acceptable. The ECB must demonstrate greater openness, with public reporting of discussions and votes. That is a requirement that cannot be abandoned.

The issue of the voting rules for the ECB’s Governing Council is very important, especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement and, so too, of the probable expansion of EMU cooperation. The present rules must be reformed. Everyone seems to agree that reform is necessary. It is not, however, entirely clear what that reform is to look like.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Friedrich’s report rejects the proposal put forward by the ECB on 3 February: a model with 21 votes on the part of 15 Central Bank governors and six auditors, and a rotating system once 16 or more countries have entered the currency union. That means that, in the extremely near future, not all Member States’ voices will be heard. There will be a system in which not everyone participates, but which is nonetheless unwieldy and complicated. If decision-making is unduly complicated, this will lead either to the Bank’s not being able to respond quickly enough to economic changes or to decisions’ not being seen as legitimate. The rotation system will make it difficult to demand accountability, because it will become almost impossible to decide which individual or individuals is or are responsible for a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Friedrich’s report, considerably compromised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, proposes fundamental principles: the principle of one member one vote and principles concerning representativeness, transparency and accountability and about taking the lead in devising a new decision-making model that will be more efficient but also designed in such a way that all members still participate.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this will be important for the small countries. It will also be significant for the new Member States. For myself, coming as I do from a country that is facing a crucial referendum on exchanging the krona for the euro, it feels only right and sensible to recommend a decision-making model that can be efficient and responsive in the long term and, at the same time, give everyone the opportunity to participate in a process in which it is also possible to demand accountability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a long time, it was too early to discuss it. This was true, in particular, when, by means of a report presented in autumn 2000, we tried to discuss it within the context of our work on enlargement. The report was by Mr Brok. Today, it would be hasty to take a decision solely on the basis of the work of the European Central Bank. The truth is that, in fact, the institutional solutions we adopt with regard to the Central Bank are sometimes frightening, because we sometimes have the impression that they could be imposed on other institutional mechanisms, or even the Union itself. That is the reality of the debate we are holding here.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, I believe that the Convention can undo what the Treaty of Nice has done. The Convention must be able to reverse proposals from the Central Bank because what is basically proposed is a change to the system, whether this involves the establishment of a rotation mechanism or differentiation between the decisions taken within the Central Bank. Essentially, once again, I believe that we cannot reject the entire proposal made by the Central Bank, for example the idea of restricting the number of members of the Governing Council if we want this body to be able to continue to take decisions. Essentially, I also believe that we should examine these proposals and try to extract what we consider to be the main points.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we can extract some information, some criteria, from the experience gained by the Central Bank in its short life. The first criterion is that the distribution of power between the Executive Board and the Governing Council must be examined carefully to ensure that the Bank is in a position to take decisions. The second criterion, which the Chairman of our committee, Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, has mentioned, concerns the transparency of decisions within decision-making bodies. The third criterion concerns the Bank’s ability to define monetary policy in the interests of the whole euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should examine the Central Bank’s proposal in light of these three criteria, and, in particular, it is in light of these three criteria that the Convention – because I think this decision is principally the responsibility of the Convention – will have to propose a solution for the future of decision-making within the Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor do I see how it is possible to reconcile the fact that a few large Member States that now happen to be obstructing the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact should have a prominent place in this lead group, while smaller Member States, which from the beginning have conducted a responsible and correct monetary policy, are relegated to second class. These proposals affect the equality of the Member States. Must those in the second and the third groups simply keep quiet in the discussion or stand aside while the great of the earth cast their votes?</p>
<p class="contents">No, Mr President, I think that the situation as we know it at present is perfectly all right. The rapporteur rightly says that we still have plenty of time to look calmly at a better system. Let us first acquire some experience of enlargement before we turn things upside down and subsequently opt for a simple and transparent management system with a European and not a national perspective. My own country would find the whole situation even more disagreeable. The Netherlands is one of the countries that have conducted a strong monetary policy for years. Initially we will be allowed to go along with this lead group, but as soon as the United Kingdom joins the euro zone we will be thanked for services rendered by being returned to the bench. Whilst I fervently hope that the United Kingdom will join at some stage, it is a rather sorry state of affairs when it entails consequences of this kind. Countries that have for some years been sawing more or less vigorously at the legs of European monetary stability are seeing themselves rewarded.

The work of the European Central Bank’s main decision-making body must be reformed in order for effective decision-making to be possible after enlargement. The model proposed by the ECB Governing Council, however, is overly complicated and vague, and will not make it any easier for the general public to follow how monetary policy is formulated. We all want to make decision-making on monetary policy more effective, but the system must be more transparent and comprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem at present with decision-making in the ECB is not how votes are cast, but the fact that the Governing Council is trying too hard to avoid voting in general. The existing version of Article 10(2) of the Statute of the European Central Bank states that the ECB Governing Council takes its decisions by a simple majority. Proposals for decisions are not, however, put to the vote before there is consensus in the discussions. According at least to the statements made in Parliament by the President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, consensus means more than a majority but less than unanimity. For the ECB to be able to react more swiftly to market changes it should practise majority voting. From this point of view, it is not sensible for the voting procedures to be made complicated and off-putting with even less voting happening than before. Moreover, the rotation model being proposed by the ECB violates several principles which both Parliament and the central bank governors themselves used to consider of vital importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparatory work to reform the ECB’s voting procedures is to be postponed until the Intergovernmental Conference takes place. Two proposals by Parliament are worthy of support. The first is the call for double key voting and the second the proposal that operational decisions concerning practical monetary policy should be distinguished in decision-making from longer-term institutional and strategic decisions. We hope that Ecofin takes Parliament’s opinion into consideration when it makes its decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, our German rapporteur relinquished his initial proposal to give each eurozone country a vote in the ECB Governing Council but to counterbalance this exclusively with the represented population. I would remind you that the ECB Governing Council examined a similar proposal by the Bundesbank during its lengthy deliberations and finally rejected it. Why? Because in a eurozone enlarged to 25 or 27 members, it means that four large Member States would have a de facto veto in the ECB Governing Council at the other countries' expense. This is unacceptable. Even if – as was agreed yesterday as a compromise in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – the two objective criteria of GDP and TAPs were additionally considered, this would result in a far less balanced system than the ECB model, which only uses these two criteria for ranking the Member States that are granted voting rights in a rotation system.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the ECB model is new and takes time to adjust to, but it is not so complex and lacking in transparency as to make it incomprehensible to those who have to deal with it. That would be an indictment of the Member States' politicians and their central bankers! Ultimately, a currency is influenced by economic and financial strength rather than by a country's population. The ECB's proposal reflects this truism.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why I did not endorse the so-called ‘compromise’ amendment is that it would lead to what amounts to renationalisation. It envisages even more enhanced competencies for the enlarged Executive Board of nine members at the expense of the ECB Governing Council, which currently meets twice a month, but which – with as many as 27 members in line with the Committee's proposal – could henceforth naturally only play a subordinate role. I hope that the Council will endorse the ECB Governing Council's far more balanced recommendation and that this can be ratified before enlargement – for the scenario which is now being proposed would deal a fatal blow to confidence in the euro.</p>

Two different issues have emerged during this debate. The first concerns the system proposed by the Central Bank, based on the implementation of the enabling clause. The question arises as to whether it is logical or not and whether a better system could be devised. The second issue concerns what a better system might involve. It might be the system detailed in Mr Friedrich’s report or it might be different again.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are concerned with at present, however, is the enabling clause established at Nice. The governments are referring to it authorising the Central Bank to present a proposal which must be unanimously approved. They are also referring to it in connection with a Commission proposal, which must also be unanimously approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The enabling clause only provides either for all the members of the central banks to be present and for all of them to vote, or, alternatively, for a system of restricted voting. Such a system would have to involve rotation. Clearly, a system of rotation means that not everyone would be involved in everything. The issue of the nature of the system of rotation then arises.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the model presented by the Central Bank does provide for a weighting of the countries based on their respective financial and economic significance. As a result, the smaller countries are given a significant role.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion, however, that there is not sufficient justification for the proposed system of rotation. The Commission therefore proposes adjusting the system of rotation only. All the Commission has done is to propose using the current Central Bank criteria to define its voting system. As I said, all this means is using the system the Bank has in place at present.</p>
<p class="contents">This system will of course involve a change. Not everyone will be present. The enabling clause does however provide for this. It would not make sense to table a further proposal for a different system of rotation, instead of suggesting an amendment to the Central Bank’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been argued in the House that the enabling clause will not resolve all the problems, and that a more ambitious stance is called for. I sympathise with these views. The Commission has adopted a similar position in some cases. Nonetheless, if a vote or decision is taken on the basis of the enabling clause, there is no doubt that the Central Bank’s proposal, suitably amended, could prove useful. It would resolve the potential problem of the transition. It is worth remembering that any alternative model would also require unanimity and ratification, and would not be easy to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
