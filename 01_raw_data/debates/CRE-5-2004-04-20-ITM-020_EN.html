I also asked in committee, on the date of the debate, for a legal opinion to be issued by its secretariat, by Parliament’s legal services or by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market, on serious issues concerning the legality or otherwise of this report; issues that I raised and tabled at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I was under the impression that my request had been accepted but to date I have still not heard this opinion. In fact, the report makes some legal and factual observations that are inadmissible in Parliament. In particular, statements are made for which the Commission has never produced any proof, such as, for example, paragraph 50’s accusations about <span class="italic">Agora, </span>a Polish publishing company; comments on the composition of <span class="italic">Mediaset</span>, which I admit are true but no evidence has been presented in paragraph 57(1); or paragraph 58(1), on the division of advertising revenue in Italy, about which I know nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more seriously, the report raises points of law that are completely inadmissible in Parliament because they would force us to discuss the laws of Member States and furthermore, the legislative powers of Member States and even the rulings of Member State courts. An example of this is the reference in paragraph 49 to a ruling of Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court on a legislative proposal introduced by the <span class="italic">Bundesrat</span>. I am shocked: how can we possibly question the legislative process pursued in Germany’s <span class="italic">Bundesrat</span>, or determine the legality or otherwise of certain facts in light of Italian national law, or of Law 249/97, of the deliberations of the Italian national authorities or of the rulings of the Italian Constitutional Court?</p>
<p class="contents">These are all matters which I am not in a position to discuss for one simple reason: they do not fall within the sphere of Parliament’s competence and I would therefore ask that this report be deemed inadmissible or referred back to the Commission until a legal study in the true sense of the word is submitted on these issues, which are serious ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I have applied a large number of tests that, in my opinion, should be applied in such a difficult situation. For example, at the beginning of this year we organised a hearing at which many experts spoke and gave their views on freedom of expression and protecting pluralism. In addition, the European Institute for the Media in Düsseldorf, a highly renowned institute, has been asked to carry out an investigation in all the countries in Europe. In my opinion, an investigation that should, in fact, have been carried out by the Commission long ago. This research will soon be available to the Commission. I have spoken to a very great number of experts and all of them, whether they represented journalists, public media or commercial media, expressed their appreciation for my recommendations. I have also drawn up a series of recommendations to promote pluralism in Europe. One of these recommendations concerns the defining of minimum conditions throughout the European Union to make sure that public broadcasters are independent and free from interference by government, as recommended by the Council of Europe. Other recommendations relate to rules on transparency and ownership of the media, especially ownership across borders, and the publishing of information about substantial interests in media. I am also requesting research into the need to include a pluralism test in the concentration regulation and the lowering of thresholds with respect to media concentrations, and also into the need to include regulations on these matters in the national rules. I am not going to sum up all my recommendations here. I only know that very many people in Europe are waiting for an update to the Green Paper from the Commission and for proposals to interpret more clearly its role with respect to freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important in a democracy that pluralism be respected. Based on all the talks I have had and also based on the report of the Institute for the Media, I have expressed a number of concerns and one of these concerns did indeed relate to Italy. After all, this was in the terms of reference for this report and I did not make up these terms of reference myself, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This assignment with this title was given to me by the Conference of Presidents. It was my duty, therefore, based on an application and based on the request of the Conference of Presidents, to pay particular attention to Italy. Many of my colleagues reinforced the attention that I had given to Italy myself even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Are matters raised in this report which should not have been? Mr President, I do not think so. Facts are presented, based on which we say to the Commission: do you not have a moral duty to develop policy on pluralism in the media? I think that the Commission does have this duty. I also noted from the advice I have taken that, when it comes to pluralism, we need to set higher standards for public media than commercial media. As rapporteur, I am very well aware that the market does its job and in general I have no objection to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The question it comes down to is whether pluralism is under threat from concentrations or any other threat, because certain media are over-concentrated in one hand. That is not new, Commissioner. We do this in all kinds of policy areas. It is one of our tasks as an internal market to watch that over-large concentrations do not develop. All I am asking is that freedom of expression be guaranteed, in the interests of a sound democracy. I think it is a great pity that some members, who have not been involved in the debate from the outset, have now suddenly submitted large numbers of amendments to bring this report down. I do not think this report deserves that, I did not expect it and I also think it is undemocratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the light of the fact – and this is where I come back to my policeman role -that Parliament has not yet agreed on the final shape of this report, I will reply tonight in fairly general terms and the Commission will follow up with a more detailed written response in the normal way.</p>
<p class="contents">The freedom of expression and information, which includes the freedom and pluralism of the media, is one of the principles common to all Member States and on which the Union is founded, as Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states. This right is also provided for in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is therefore no surprise that the Commission fully agrees with the statement that a free and pluralist media sector is a prerequisite for freely functioning democracies. We all need to remain most vigilant as regards all aspects of media pluralism in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should stress that the protection of media pluralism is primarily a task for the Member States. The question of subsidiarity is crucial in this context. National measures to promote medial pluralism could, for example, include provisions determining share ownership in media companies or measures promoting culturally and linguistically diversified content.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of all measures aiding media pluralism is to protect freedom of expression and to ensure that the media reflect a spectrum of views and opinions characteristic of a democratic society. At present, secondary Community legislation does not contain any provisions specifically aimed at safeguarding the pluralism of the media. However, Community law allows the application of national safeguards with regard to media pluralism. Nevertheless, a number of existing Community legal instruments contribute either directly or indirectly to the aim of preserving media pluralism. For example, the Television without Frontiers Directive contributes to the safeguarding of media pluralism through a number of content-related provisions, in particular through its provisions on the promotion of European productions and of the work of independent producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Media Programme also plays an important role, whilst the application of competition rules impacts positively on media pluralism. Whilst the primary objective of Community competition law is economic – that is, to ensure workable competition between market operators – it also helps to prevent an excessive degree of control or cumulative holdings in media companies which might endanger the existence of a wide spectrum of views and opinions in the media market.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate what was said by my colleague Commissioner Vitorino during the debate on fundamental rights last month. The Commission is committed to ensuring that respect for all fundamental rights across the Union is properly monitored. We also very much look forward to the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitutional Treaty, giving it full legal status.</p>
<p class="contents">I am only sorry that this debate has not given me the opportunity to comment <span class="italic">in extenso</span> – as they used to say in Rome – on the ownership of the media in the country which I know best. I would have been able to express my views to Parliament about media, much of which believes passionately in nationalism except when it comes to the ownership of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have been able to express my views about media proprietors who wish to exercise considerable political influence without ever standing for electoral office, partly because they are not citizens of the country I know best. I am sorry that I do not have the opportunity to make those points this evening. News International and Mr Murdoch are also very sorry that I do not have the opportunity to make those points, but perhaps on a future occasion there will be a plethora of members of the party with which I am associated who will press me to make those points about media ownership in the United Kingdom; and when I am encouraged to do so, I will try to ensure that Commissioner Vitorino handles the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It did so having in-depth knowledge, being totally objective, without any disagreement and in an extremely rigorous way, calling for a commitment to diversification of ownership and control of telecommunications and television broadcasting, calling for free competition, calling for the principle of pluralism to also be observed by broadcasters, and stressing the need for media pluralism because this is a fundamental right.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore drafted a series of assessments and put forward amendments to be incorporated, which the Committee on Freedoms did not take into consideration at all. We discussed matters impartially yet a majority in the Committee on Freedoms want to be obstructionist – that really is obstructionism –<span class="bold"> </span>and somehow consider just the political aspect of the situation. Thus they try to foist onto Italy a situation and an assessment that it does not deserve, since we must not let Italy as a whole be given a negative assessment.

One only has to read the British press today and speculations on why Tony Blair has made his U-turn on an EU referendum to see that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret the focus in this report on the attacks made on the Italian Government. That has detracted from the quality of the report. The Committee on Culture, for which I am speaking, has taken the issue very seriously and has repeatedly underlined that pluralism in the media is fundamental for safeguarding democracy and cultural diversity in Europe. In our report on the television without frontiers directive, we asked for a Green Paper from the Commission and a special study on this subject. We are still waiting for that Green Paper. We recognise that the Member States have primary responsibility. However, in today's rapidly shrinking world, the European Union cannot ignore its responsibilities and its special position free from the power of one or two powerful press magnates. It is a pity this report has confused these aims with naked political attacks on the Italian Government. The issue deserved better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs unanimously adopted its opinion, which can be broken down into three basic points. The first point is the conflict of interests, for which we all hope – and I stress the word hope – that there will be legislation intended to prohibit political figures or candidates from having major economic interests in the media. The second point states that it is necessary to draw up a procedure whereby Parliament can independently – I repeat, independently – initiate proceedings to make it possible to carry out investigations into the human rights situation in a Member State pursuant to Article 7(1) of our Treaty. Finally, the third point is the one in which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs considers that any action by a Member State that results in limiting the freedom of expression and the freedom of information within the country will represent a breach of this article.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that there is no hostile intention but simply a unanimous desire, at least in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to draw up a procedure to know how the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission must act in such sensitive cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The document that we are discussing has, in fact, been hijacked by a hidden agenda – depriving the cultural, scientific and technical research that the title announces of any value – even though the fact that the title itself picks out Italy as a country in which freedom of information is allegedly under greater threat than elsewhere, gives an early indication of biased conclusions that are simply meant to hurt the Italian Government and particularly its Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">In support of this report, the rapporteur presents the conclusions of a study carried out by a Düsseldorf institute – which was never authorised by this Parliament – with findings that are anything but clear and definitive. The study starts by announcing its aim of comparing the information situation in the 25 Member States; it then provides a few data on only eight countries, explicitly pointing out the provisional nature and shortcomings of this survey. A question springs to mind, Mr President, which I put to this Chamber: why the hurry? Why not wait until the study was complete with the full complement of 25 countries? I could give an answer, but perhaps I am too cynical.</p>
<p class="contents">The original text has been padded out with a raft of amendments that present the situation in Italy in a paradoxical light, to say the least, with personal references and criticisms of the Italian Prime Minister that are not in keeping with the style and language of the European Parliament. The President, Pat Cox, wrote as much in a letter today, in which he called on the rapporteur to correct the tone and cut out the personal references. The rapporteur has indeed proposed a few cosmetic touches – as she describes them – as a gesture of willingness. Frankly, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, they are not enough. What is needed here is a complete face-lift to restore some dignity to the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Italy is very different from the way it is described. This is confirmed by a report last year by Reporters Without Borders, an organisation that is certainly not close to the Italian Government or its Prime Minister; on the contrary, it is highly critical. Nevertheless, it states that the Italian press on the whole reflects the variety of political positions that are expressed in Parliament and presents an exhaustive spread of opinions that is often critical of the government. The report then analyses the various affinities of the news programmes on television and radio, the daily press and periodicals, etc., and comments: ‘While the print media offer a range of political views that fairly reflect the reality of the Italian political arena, they suffer economically from the broadcast media’s dominance.’ Finally – the last point – it says that the print media as a whole are unfavourable to the government and the ruling majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, then, Mr President, is the truth? It is a shame, because one just cannot see where the truth lies. This report could have helped to uphold it. We know where it is. Unfortunately, the report betrays it and mortifies it.</p>

I particularly thank her for the great patience she has shown in the face of the unjustified criticism and obstructionism of the last few days, which were certainly not inspired by an interest in protecting a fundamental right of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, which was drawn up with the authorisation and according to the instructions of the Conference of Presidents, addresses the subject of the freedom and the political and cultural pluralism of the media, which are essential elements in a full democracy. This, in turn, is a founding value of the European Union, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty. The report, which is entirely acceptable, analyses the criteria to be observed and the instruments that can be adopted to ensure that freedom and pluralism of information are guaranteed, and suggests possibilities for intervention by the Community and the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. With its analyses and proposals, this work will be of great significance for the future of the enlarged Community of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also examines the risks of violation of freedom of expression and information, particularly in Italy, as specified in the mandate given to the committee. There are risks everywhere and all the time, but it is difficult to deny the anomaly in Italy due to objective and incontestable factors: it has the highest level of concentration of the audiovisual market in Europe, characterised by the duopoly of a public organisation, RAI, and a private group, Mediaset, which collect 96.8% of advertising resources; by the fact that the Mediaset group is controlled by the current Prime Minister; by the fact that in Italy the structure and programming of the public television service are influenced by the government and its ruling majority; and by the fact that the conflict of interests of the Prime Minister has still not been resolved. In addition, as demonstrated by numerous judgments by the Italian Constitutional Court, the Italian broadcasting service has for years been operating in unlawful circumstances, which the legislators have not yet remedied; indeed, the laws passed so far, which have ratified the <span class="italic">de facto</span> occupation of frequencies – that is to say, the operation of installations by the largest private group without concessions or authorisations, totally at variance with any concern for greater pluralism – have gradually been declared unconstitutional, and the latest law reforming the audiovisual sector has been referred back to Parliament by the President of the Republic because it did not comply with the principles laid down by the Constitutional Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these incontestable facts, it is impossible not to see the serious risk of concrete, repeated breaches of the fundamental right to pluralism of information that the citizens of Europe are facing in Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can it be possible that Mediaset is lying? Then again, the facts that have been presented to us regarding the risks to freedom of information in Italy are so obvious and serious that it would be pointless to repeat them. I should like, instead, to offer some comments and thoughts on them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not wrong to state that there is still freedom of expression in my country, but the space for freedom of information has been greatly restricted. What we see happening, in fact, is something that is spreading to a dangerous extent these days. The lack of plurality of information in Italy is today becoming a lack of information, full stop. Even the case of a Member of the European Parliament who is facing criminal charges for colluding with the Mafia has been met with silence in the media. The breaches are so numerous and so frequent that they make one think of a closed, self-referential system tenaciously pursuing those antidemocratic objectives that were at the root of the revival plan of Licio Gelli and his breakaway masonic lodge, P2, one member of which was Mr Berlusconi, whose card number was 1816.</p>
<p class="contents">How much space would be devoted in another European country to news of a Mafia trial involving the premier’s right-hand man, the co-founder of his party? A law to resolve the devastating conflict of interests of the Italian Prime Minister – and many of his ministers into the bargain – is now absolutely essential. We have all seen the obstructionism that has been deployed against the Boogerd-Quaak report in the last few days. They want to prevent it from being discussed in this House so as not to indict an information system designed to produce only approval for the person who owns or controls it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is never pleasant to speak ill of one’s own country, but the most negative aspect is represented by the events occurring in Italy. We must speak out against them loud and clear, in reproach and condemnation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent report, which stems from her concern – shared by the overwhelming majority in Parliament – for the freedom of information and expression in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We would, of course, have preferred it if the Commission had put forward a specific proposal for a directive during these five years. The situation is indeed causing ever greater concern in all the countries in the Union as a result of massive concentrations of the media and increasingly blatant attempts by governments to steer, control and use the media in order to maintain and increase their own power.</p>
<p class="contents">The dreadful example of Italy, however, concerns us most, both because of the damage it has done to freedom of information and because of the example it sets to other European countries. Europe cannot continue to remain silent about the scandal of a Prime Minister who owns the three private television networks, owns the largest company collecting television advertising revenue and controls the three public networks, at the head of which he places all his political sympathisers, and he even publicly announces the dismissal of journalists like Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, whom he considers undesirable.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe that is becoming more and more neoliberalistic and antidemocratic, where the power of the media actively contributes to a single way of thinking, to wars and to the dismantling of the welfare state, we have to give a sign that we are changing direction or, at least, rethinking things.</p>

The first is to reaffirm yet again that the majority in this Parliament believes that dealing with the freedom of expression of the media lies perfectly within the competence of the European Union, and that it is therefore necessary to act since this issue may become a real problem – indeed, a danger – for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new subject. This time it has been treated in a more specific and elaborate manner and it is better substantiated with examples, but it is not very different from what Parliament unanimously approved some time ago, when it asked the Commission to take action. No action was ever taken, and I should like to hear the reasons for that, if you know what they are, Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to give a number of concrete examples of these dangers, which certainly exist in several countries but are demonstrated in Italy in an absolutely flagrant way: purely and simply the concentration of political, media and economic power in the hands of a single person. From a political, cultural and legislative point of view, this would be practically impossible in any other western democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I want to underline in this report is the recommendations it makes. These are recommendations addressed to the countries, particularly Italy; indeed, they are not very different from the conclusions of the report mentioned by Mr Santini. They are the resolution of the conflict of interests and also the resolution of the concentration of media power in Italy in the hands of two individuals, as well as – and I am repeating it again because I think it is particularly important – the request for the Commission to take action and legislate on this matter.</p>

I find it depressing that a certain part of the Italian Left, blinded by their need to indict the Italian Prime Minister and thus the whole government – which, I am pleased to recall, was democratically elected by a majority – should concoct and consent to an inquisitorial report like this, devoted to the situation ‘especially in Italy’, as it says in the title, with the sole purpose of discrediting Italy itself. I will not accept the unscrupulousness or the pretence at morality of this kind of constant anti-Italian crusade, which is also supported by certain Members of the European Left who first attracted attention for having insulted Italy during the Italian Presidency and then attracted even more attention for falsifying signatures in the attendance register, as suspected by their own party colleagues. I will not accept moral lessons from those who have still not had the courage to condemn the Commission properly for the disgraceful Eurostat scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should be pleased if this Italian and European Left could find the time and, especially, the courage to devote an equally detailed report to the conflict of interests of Mr Prodi, who is President of the European Commission in his spare moments and Ulivo leader in Italy full-time, and who, to further his political fight with Italy, has, despite our efforts, only succeeded in weakening and damaging the image of the European Commission itself.</p>

<p class="contents">As a Fleming, all I can do is note the hypocrisy with which the champions of selective indignation once again think they have to give the Italian Government lessons in democracy. The rapporteur has set them an example today however, and so I would strongly advise her to do some research into how the opposition in my country, Belgium, is being systematically boycotted by the public broadcaster. The rapporteur might find out how the First Minister of my country put pressure on an editor-in-chief to report favourably on the government. She might discover how the public broadcaster, in a kind of Pravda-style slavishness, merely operates to safeguard the cult of celebrity around that First Minister. She might note how the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently tried again to prevent the broadcasting of a documentary about the crimes of Belgium and the royal house in our former colony the Congo. She might note, finally, how my party, the Flemish Block, that represents 18% of the electorate, was summoned to appear in court by a generously subsidised government organisation purely for the offence of giving an opinion. They really are violations of the freedom of expression, yet I do not find them in this report. This is not a balanced report, therefore, that is sincerely concerned about any shortcomings within the Union in the field of freedom of expression. This report is an attempt at intimidation from the Left, that simply cannot stomach the fact that the Italian electorate turns out to have voted in a non-politically correct way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights states that plurality is essential to the functioning of democracy. What this House has observed is an undeniably increasing unease amongst large sectors of information professionals and large sectors of the public with regard to the information they receive through the media.</p>
<p class="contents">The concentration of private media organisations in a few hands and the misuse of the public media by public authorities, by governments, are the two central concerns in this field. So this is even worse when both concerns come together, or when a political position and a business interest in the media coincide.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation, Mr President, should take account of this need for plurality and should have instruments for actively defending it. This is what this House proposes in the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, whom I would like to thank for her effort and patience.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that the Commission and the Member States should study these proposals and accept them or, at least, tell us what they think of them. I believe this would be well received by this House and by the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, until the day it voted on this report in committee, voted and worked as it has done over the last five years, that is to say, in a reasonable and sensible way, listening – something which I believe is not very common in this Parliament today – listening to each others arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is going to be my final speech in this plenary, because I have chosen not to return in the next Parliament and I would like to thank the Chairman of the committee, Jorge Hernández Mollar, for the way in which he has led the committee to date and also on this extremely difficult issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the issue we are dealing with, I do not wish to end without saying – and this is the fundamental issue – that the citizens, Mr President – and they have demonstrated this in recent days in my country, in Spain – when they believe that information is subject to intolerable manipulation, react. I am therefore optimistic in this area. I hope that the institutions can act in the way the citizens expect us to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can only be dismayed and also somewhat amused by the very odd performance in this House by my honourable colleagues in the Berlusconi group. There are very serious parliamentarians – grave to the point of sounding ponderous – like Mr Podestà, who is also Vice-President of this House, suddenly behaving as if they have gone into a rhetorical spasm, with Mr Tajani transformed into the Incredible Hulk and many other respected Members of this House beating their chests like King Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened? Obviously, the gentleman in Rome has issued some very precise orders to his group, which he is quite entitled to do, and the order is to stop the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak at any cost. Filibustering is more than understandable and more than justified, even as some acceptable form of obstructionism; but I wonder whether we have not gone too far, beyond the rules and traditions of this House, with these continuous attempts – and we will see many more before tomorrow, because rumours circulate very fast in this House – to postpone consideration of this report and take it off the agenda. Let me say that I disapprove of this behaviour – not because I belong to a nostalgic Communist group or am a Bolshevik, as I have been called, but because I still respect this House, its traditions, its standards and its rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am from Valencia and, historically, the Valencians have close relations with the Italians – in fact two Valencians (Calixtus III and Rodrigo Borgia) were Popes in Italy during the Renaissance – but I believe that this is a fundamental and European issue and I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, for their speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, by means of subsidiarity and also the Commission's initiative, we should regulate and act on the structuring of pluralism, the media and, above all, neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a European region – Valencia – which has not seen neutrality in the public media. I am not talking now about <span class="italic">Televisión Española</span>, which is a flagrant case, but about <span class="italic">Canal Nou</span>, Valencian television, which is a textbook example of how a public television station is used for party political purposes. Neutrality means not being party political, nor being subject to governmental use, to manipulation of information or being used by a political party in the case of a public media organisation, as in the case of Valencian television. I therefore believe that, by means of the Commission's initiatives, we should put forward initiatives to legislate to create advisory councils. In this regard, we admire models of public television such as the BBC and we would like, as Valencians, both <span class="italic">Televisión Española</span> and <span class="italic">Canal Nou</span>, our Valencian television, to be neutral, and, in the future, to have a neutral television company which gives space to all parties. A party such as mine, which is the third biggest municipal political force in our country, has no presence on our television and I believe this issue is fundamental to European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to say that the topic of the pluralism of information is a European topic, and what Commissioner Patten has said underlines that strongly. That very fact, however, Commissioner, shows that it is the European Commission that has not fulfilled its duties in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last two years, Parliament has twice called on the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive, and this has not been done. This is not a matter of either Right or Left, and it is an over-simplification to think it only applies to Italy. The topic was brought before this Parliament by means of a resolution signed by myself and 31 other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats or other groups on the Right, because it goes much deeper than Italy and concerns a value which belongs to the whole of Europe and every civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in Italy the matter has gone beyond the danger point. In addition to a public television service that has never escaped from party control, private television too is wholly in the political hands of the government. That, unfortunately, is serious, and the report is right about that. I shall vote in favour of the report, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is written in this disgraceful report is not true, and the rapporteur could have based it, for instance, on data from an independent institute such as the Osservatorio di Pavia. But the rapporteur preferred to ignore many things: she even ignored what happened to the journalist Hans-Martin Tillach a few steps away from the European Parliament. There is not a word about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither TG1 nor the Canale 5 news programmes – the television news programmes owned by Mr Berlusconi or those that the rapporteur says are controlled by the Italian Government – are not Al-Jazeera, even though every evening, until a few evenings ago, seeing an elegant leftist woman calling the <span class="italic">mujaheddin</span> guerrillas ‘resistance fighters’ and the attacks on westerners ‘resistance’ might have made you think so. The public and private television system in our country, in which left-wing journalists get fat on hundreds of millions in pay, is not Al-Jazeera, while the far-left dailies – which are always blasting away at the government – take the government’s money. I should like to know whether <span class="italic">Libération</span> in France takes Mr Raffarin’s money. It is like that in Italy.</p>

Indeed, I am deeply disappointed and saddened by this report, in both its technical and its political aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">From a legal and technical point of view, it is almost an abuse of parliamentary procedure: it mentions facts and people often out of context, without any evidence to support the serious allegations it makes; it uses third parties as reliable sources of information without having gone through the proper procedure for assigning the task, according to the Rules of Procedure; it makes critical assessments of countries that have yet to become active members of our institution without any supporting evidence; it does not take adequate account of the assessments made by the competent committees asked to give an opinion; it violates a basic criterion of our legal activity – subsidiarity – particularly regarding legislation; it even censures national parliaments; and I could go on down a long list. It is such a poorly made report that the President of Parliament himself, Pat Cox, in reply to a letter by Mr Podestà, says that, even though they are admissible, certain parts of the text need changing so as to comply fully with parliamentary practice and our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In its political aspects, unfortunately, all this is overshadowed by the thirst for a political smear campaign. For me, an MEP who loves politics and believes it to be an irreplaceable tool for building a better society, that is truly the worst part of it. Reports like this and the use of the institutions as an election tool strike at the heart of our institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This institution has a dignity of its own and a credibility built up over years of hard work, years of adopting consistent and serious positions. Becoming a theatre of national quarrels for electoral purposes deals a mortal blow to the future of this institution and undermines its foundations and its credibility in the eyes of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
