<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frédérique Ries (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I should like straightaway to start by thanking my fellow shadow rapporteurs, who are present: Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mrs McAvan, Mrs Evans, Mrs Sinnott and Mrs Belohorská. I must say that my contact with them has been particularly intense and fruitful since my appointment as rapporteur, nine months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote some particularly striking figures in this report: 38% of women, 27% of men and almost five million children in the EU are obese, with between 300 000 and 400 000 new cases of obesity recorded among our youngest children each year. This is both a simple and a terrible situation. In 2000, the WHO defined obesity as the major health problem of the countries of the West. How could it be otherwise when, on average, 6% of the national healthcare budgets are devoted to all those diseases that are caused by a person’s being overweight: type 2 diabetes, breathing problems, heart problems and other kinds of problems? Over and above these figures, it is important to add and to spell out that the most worrying thing is the fact that this disease is now on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an initial observation to be made, which we all agree on: we have not reacted in time and, when I say ‘we’, I am indeed referring to governments, to boards of health and education and indeed to us, as parents.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation, which is just as obvious, is that it is not easy to fight effectively against obesity and all its consequences for people’s health. That requires a global, holistic approach, which takes account of such varied factors as heredity, lifestyle and education in terms of eating a balanced and varied diet, and this from as early an age as possible. A person’s family and professional background is a crucial factor. We cannot overlook the fact that job insecurity and poverty are factors that sometimes trigger or, in any case, cause a further rise in, obesity.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation is that we are not starting from scratch. There are currently sixty or so initiatives on the prevention of obesity and the promotion of physical activity that benefit from or warrant monitoring at European level, such as Fleurbaix and Laventie and Food Dudes, to name but two.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said time and again, when it comes to this fight, Europe does not just have something to say; it has a huge contribution to make. If Europe’s aim is to provide real added value, it needs to integrate nutrition and physical activity into the other Community policies, and to do so across the board, in areas in which, fortunately, the European Union’s largest budgets are concentrated: the common agricultural policy, the seventh research framework programme and the structural funds. I am also delighted that, as part of the reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables that was launched last week by Commissioner Fischer Boel, one of the seven priorities – the seven major objectives – was to promote people’s consumption of this type of highly nutritious food.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I should like to repeat in this House, as I did in the report, that I prefer an incentive policy, price cuts, tax reductions or other kind of subsidy, to any system resembling a tax on calorific products that is of the ‘fat tax’ kind, because, ultimately, such a system would penalise the lowest income households in Europe the most.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with all of the compromises we have reached in our work on important points in this report. I will not mention them all, but I will, however, mention one or two of them. The compromise on paragraph 4, which recommends that, like the WHO, all the Member States officially recognise obesity as a chronic disease: this is a strong demand, backed by patients’ associations, which we have a duty to pass on; it is also undoubtedly the surest way of preventing certain kinds of people in our society from being stigmatised and of ensuring that healthcare systems provide a reasonable level of care. The compromise on paragraphs 16 and 17, next, which point out the importance of schools in terms of teaching children how to lead healthy lives – whether they are in the school canteen or on the sports field. The compromise on paragraph 30 lastly, on the urgent need to do as we propose and implement a simplified and harmonised form of labelling foodstuffs that are high in salt, sugar and certain fats.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make it clear that I agree with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when they attack foods and drinks that are too high in calories. Yes, we must stop this slightly tiresome political correctness that leads to inaction. Who can still believe and declare today that, from a nutritional point of view, there are not good foods and bad foods? The fact that there are bad foods highlights why it is also important for the European Union to get to grips with reducing people’s consumption of saturated fats – which is the subject of our paragraph 28 – as they are responsible for bad cholesterol and, by extension, for a whole host of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I regret that our debates are, as I see it, far too focused on the issue of banning television advertisements for food and drinks that are high in sugar, salt and fat from being broadcast during children’s programmes. It seems to me that this debate has largely been settled by our vote on the revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive in December 2006 – very recently, then. That is the point expressed very precisely by our compromise amendment 5. For my part, too, I would have difficulty explaining to a mother the logic of a policy that bans television advertising for, for example, chocolate bars but that, on the other hand, authorises the same advertising on the Internet or on the big screen, and that is the reasoning behind our paragraph 24.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I am convinced that all of us here, in this House, share the same desire. Firstly, to halt this epidemic, by making discernable progress in four or five years, particularly where children are concerned. Secondly, we need to try to reverse this trend by 2015 at the latest, through ambitious policies at every level of power, including at European level. That is why we expect a great deal from you, Commissioner Kyprianou, and of the forthcoming White Paper, too, which you will be presenting to us in the spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can easily say that I agree with her approach taken in the report and especially of course the underlining of the need to place public health at the centre of considerations right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for all of us is to make this happen. We are talking here about a big challenge because we are referring to changes of lifestyle and that is not always an easy task. It is a long-term and constant effort and we have to insist and persist on this. It is a complex problem which requires complex solutions. The Commission did not follow the blame game because, in reality, we are all to blame for this. We saw the problem creeping up but we tended to ignore it; we always thought it was more of a problem for North America and we were ignoring the fact that it was becoming a European problem. So we all have responsibility and therefore we all have to contribute to its solution.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is very high on our agenda, and I can repeat here once again that obesity could easily be the most serious health threat for the European Union for the 21st century. There is no need to analyse the problems and the health concerns and harm that arise out of obesity. Even more worrying is the rising prevalence of obesity among children. The figures are really worrying: 40 million children today, increasing by 400 000 a year. This is really something of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will adopt a White Paper this coming month. In developing and drafting this paper – I can call it a strategy – we will take the ideas and the views raised in the report seriously into account.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, this approach will follow a combination of self-regulatory, voluntary and – why not? – some regulatory measures as well. In relation to regulation, I could easily refer to health claims or the review on food labelling that will be coming out soon, this year most probably. But of course we have the platform, you are aware of that, where we have concrete commitments on the part of the stakeholders. These are commitments that have to be verifiable and monitored and independent in an objective way. We will soon be issuing the second monitoring report from the platform.</p>
<p class="contents">The report touches on many issues and many topics with which we agree, such as food reformulation, incentive schemes for self-regulation and the very sensitive issue of the advertising of foods to children. The truth is, until now we have been concentrating very much on the intake of food, on nutrition. We now aim to put more emphasis on the physical activity part, which is also a serious concern for European citizens. Member States also have a great responsibility here and I would like to highlight the reference in the report to sports in schools. This is a very important factor. It is embarrassing for me to say that in the European Union there is not enough physical activity in schools among children and teenagers. The big challenge is not only to bring it back but to make it fun again. This is an important factor. I can very briefly refer to a parent who was complaining to me that his son comes back home from school and plays basketball on the computer and does not play the real game outside in the schoolyard. This is the reality. So your reference to video games is very important, but we also have to use a more scientific, a more advanced, a more modern approach to bring fun back to physical exercise so that schoolchildren and teenagers exercise for fun. Sport should not just be for athletes and competitors, but for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already referred to the reform of the common organisation of the markets in fruit and vegetables. We intend to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables. This is a very important aspect, but we will also continue working on the aspect of affordability as well, because unfortunately nowadays healthy food is much more expensive than what we have come to know as junk food.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish here and thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work. I assure you that we will take Parliament’s views very seriously into account when we are drafting our strategy over the next few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality where this issue was concerned, and I should have liked to have seen a clearer gender equality perspective in the work done on the report. I think it important for Parliament to task the Commission with further developing its gender-based strategy on excessive weight and obesity, diet and exercise, especially when it comes to collecting data and sharing best practice. We also need to devise a communications strategy for the whole Community. We must not forget that women and men are different. Women’s obesity should be investigated more carefully, especially given the discrimination within the healthcare system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many EU countries, over half the adult population is overweight, with nearly one-third of all adults categorised as obese. There are also three million children in Europe already in the obese category, with a further 14 million considered overweight. Children have even been observed developing diseases normally associated with old age, such as Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a major problem, it is getting worse and it affects us all. In my own country our National Audit Office has quantified the economic consequences of obesity to be around half a billion pounds annually in direct health costs, plus a further two billion pounds in wider costs to the economy. As taxpayers, we all pay for the problem, so we are all stakeholders in finding a solution. Something must clearly be done, but the issue is, who decides?</p>
<p class="contents">This thoughtful report from Mrs Ries makes clear that it is not for the EU to decide. There can be help at EU level by sharing best practice, promoting new ideas, etc., because health promotion is an agreed EU competence. Health provision is for Member States. However, responsibility lies not just with Member State governments or food and drink manufacturers, but with parents and individuals themselves. We do not want a big nanny state or a big nanny Europe only permitting us to do what it considers good for us. We want to help people decide for themselves, and that is also why we have referred to the Television Without Frontiers Directive, calling for Member States and the Commission to develop codes of conduct regarding children’s advertising, rather than compulsory controls. For avoidance of doubt, I am referring to the revisions approved by Parliament to that directive last December.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should remember that calorie inputs represent only half the problem. I am delighted that the Commissioner in his opening remarks referred to the other half, which was energy output, i.e. that people of all ages should take more exercise. I am also delighted that he referred to the need for governments and others to promote competitive sports and stop selling off school playing fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone has a responsibility to address the problem. It is time that everyone faced up to it. I congratulate the Commission on its paper and particularly the rapporteur for the care and thought that she has put into this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs. We have all worked together and I think, Commissioner, you will see that we have a general consensus that something must be done. We are grateful to the Commission for putting this issue at the top of its working agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot do everything. Mr Bushill-Matthews said that. Responsibility is at national level, but there are three areas where the EU could make a difference. The first has already been mentioned: food labelling. What we in the PSE Group want is mandatory back-of-pack labelling of the eight key nutrients. We do not want labelling where the industry itself decides which nutrients it is going to make consumers aware of. Many retail companies and food companies are doing this already and they want a level playing field as well. Many of them want mandatory labelling on the back of the pack, and I think it is something you should be looking at in the revision of your regulations, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We want front-of-pack signposting and clear systems, and we want this to happen soon. As regards advertising, we must not play lip-service to tackling advertising to children. We have to do something real about it. In the UK something real is happening. Our regulator is now stopping advertising of foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt to children, and I think we should look for this across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a key area you could work in, Commissioner, is that of product reformulation. This week is National Salt Awareness Week in the UK. Many food manufacturers have reduced salt successfully in foods in the UK. We want to see more action on that level and we want to see more action on trans fats. Mrs Ries mentioned this. Trans fats are dangerous. They have no nutritional value. They are banned in New York. Denmark has tried to take action. We want you to stop the action against Denmark and to take action at EU level to do something about trans fats. What is the point of adding things to food which have no value?</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the written declaration that I, Mr Higgins, Mr Jørgensen and Mr Bowis have launched this week calling for the EU to act on trans fats. I hope you will look at that, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They need to be re-educated, so to speak. What is crucial in this regard is the manner in which such information is communicated.</p>
<p class="contents">When considering appropriate ways in which to get this message across, we could bear in mind the experience we have gained in other areas of awareness-raising. For example, for a long time the general public ignored calls for individuals to take part in the efforts to combat climate change. But things have changed. Public information broadcasts on television have already fallen on fertile ground, but before the message hits home we will obviously need a long period of patient information-giving.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the need to convince young people to abandon unhealthy eating habits is concerned, we should not underestimate the role played by parents because they also need to be re-educated. Once they are convinced that healthy eating is good for their children, they will be able to make a greater contribution themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I have reports from my constituency that some parents, encouraged by our activities in the European Parliament, have obtained authorisation from a school to initiate the process of changing the external circumstances which affect the pupils’ eating habits. For example, they have removed vending machines that dispense unhealthy foods from the immediate vicinity of the school, they have started encouraging children to eat seasonal fruit at school lunches and, would you believe it, the children walk to school every day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore particularly important for the future of European society. Special attention should be paid to the health of children and young people and to the environment in which children spend most of their time, namely school and the home.</p>
<p class="contents">In many European countries, the quality of the food provided in educational institution dining halls is not what it should be. Easy access to sugary snacks and excessively sweet drinks makes it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. In addition, there is a tendency for children to be fed highly processed foods at home. One of the reasons for this is that healthy food, that is to say organic food, is expensive. The same is the case with fruit. Action should therefore be taken to increase cofinancing for organic agriculture in the Member States of the Union, especially where soft fruits are concerned. The price of fruit and vegetables would then decrease. The Commissioner referred to this earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Results can only be achieved through a clear health promotion policy accompanied by specific actions. Approaching the problem simply by making declarations will create a mistaken belief that we will muddle through somehow. In fact, if the mechanisms needed to support organic food production are not put in place quickly to ensure that this type of food is widely available, European Union countries will very soon have to increase their expenditure on health protection. Appropriate action in this regard must be taken in the relevant committees, including the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because soft fruit production is not receiving adequate support and aid from the Union’s budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would have liked to see more binding proposals in this Green Paper, of the kind that would have made it clear that we are embarking on a legislative process rather than appealing to industry to regulate itself. We have learned from experience in so many other spheres that these are just stalling tactics. </p>
<p class="contents">Figures from the WHO, showing that 1.5 billion people around the world are too fat, while 800 million are suffering from hunger, thus making clear not only that the problem is a global one, but also that there is a particular problem within the European Union, where one child in every four is overweight, with 300 000 new cases occurring every year, so it really is more than high time that we took action.</p>
<p class="contents">However good the proposals and ideas that the report contains, and which we do of course welcome, we would have liked them to include more obligations, and the Commission to have had the courage to propose banning the use of trans fatty acids in industrially produced foods. We know that trans fatty acids do harm, and I am glad that certain Member States have now summoned up the courage to ban them, but I wish the Commission had shown the same nerve in proposing a similar ban throughout the European Union, and I hope that we will be able to remedy that omission. Something else of value would be a ban on the use of toys as enticements to get children to eat junk food in fast-food restaurants and so on. It must, I think, be reiterated once more, loud and clear – and I am going to end on this point – that we really do have to do more about advertising in order to ensure that obesity and the threat of diabetes in children and young people do not get out of hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that excessive weight and obesity are serious problems that have consequences not only for those directly affected but also for society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we should ask ourselves, however, is whether this really is a problem that should be dealt with at EU level. I, for my part, do not think that it is. Why should the EU pronounce on where in the Member States schools should be located? Does this House think that people are unaware that fruit and vegetables are good for them or that exercise is important to good health? Paragraph 46 of the report expresses concern at the fall in the consumption of fruit and vegetables within the EU, and this on account of the fact that such products are expensive. That in itself gives one pause for thought, given the huge subsidies received by EU farmers via the common agricultural policy. Is the next step to demand an increase in agricultural aid? Obesity and related diseases are issues for each Member State to get to grips with in the light of the particular conditions that prevail there.

Of course, there are 800 million children in the world at risk of dying of hunger, while we, for our part, have 14 million obese children, and the number is rising.</p>
<p class="contents">So what, then, can be done, not to stop them looking like figures painted by Fernando Botero, but to save 7% of our health costs each year?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the option of diets. Apart from the Biafran diet, which is too dangerous, there is the Cretan one, but that requires olive oil, fruit, vegetables and white meats and, unfortunately, the overhauled common agricultural policy is destroying our olive trees and putting our market gardeners, tree growers and poultry farmers out of work.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also financial regimes, which are very effective. Indeed, obesity declines the further up the income ladder you go. At the top of the ladder, the rich are all thin. The poor need, therefore, to be made richer if they are also to be made thinner. To achieve this, however, we should need to reconsider the Maastricht austerity pact, which produces people excluded from society and, therefore, fat people.</p>
<p class="contents">As for myself, my only hope is that global warming continues. In that way, European children would get plenty of exercise travelling on their little camels to schools surrounded by sand dunes. I also hope that none of these children with sunken eyes and swollen stomachs will read Mrs Ries’s report, because there are two ways of throwing up: one is to eat too much, and the other is to read a scandalous report like this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think I am in a position to judge this, having spent three years examining the problem of increasing obesity among Europeans, particularly children, in connection with the famous – or notorious – issue of nutritional and health statements on food, which the Commissioner will not have forgotten. </p>
<p class="contents">I see it as particularly important that an holistic approach be taken to the problem, for it is one that has to do with society as a whole; it is not an individual food or the enticing advertising for it that is causing people to be fatter and fatter and hence more and more prone to illnesses. We know that the modern lifestyle is the real problem; we do not get about enough! </p>
<p class="contents">Is this, though, a problem that can be resolved by legislation? Generally speaking, I still have my misgivings about bans on advertising, for these simply suggest that it is the product that is bad and to be blamed for people’s suffering. The ordinary public see that as <span class="italic">dirigisme</span> on the part of the State, the sort of thing that puts people off Europe and leads them to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever became of individuals’ personal responsibility? Have they suddenly become something less than adult? What about parents’ responsibility for their children? That is something we should be insisting on! But Europeans, of course, need better education, comprehensible labelling of food, and information about a healthy lifestyle in order to be able to exercise that responsibility for themselves; after all, parents do want a good and healthy future for their children. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us not, while we on this subject, forget the European principle of subsidiarity. We cannot and must not be more than brokers of ideas between the Member States. It is no part of our function to interfere in such things as schools, which are organised on national – or, as in Germany, on regional – lines. It is a fundamental principle that coercion by force of law is misguided, that pressure produces resistance. By our policies, we must persuade people and carry them with us; that is the only way we will get anywhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These proposals also emphasise the important role of school canteens, which must offer children and adolescents a balanced diet involving healthy produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever they have been implemented in our countries, these measures have produced satisfactory results, and several studies indicate that such programmes, designed as they are to prevent obesity and to promote healthy eating, have made it possible to stabilise the obesity rate among overweight young people - a rate that, overall, is otherwise constantly increasing. The figures were pointed out just now. That is what leads me to say that we really must urge the Commission to bring such programmes into much more widespread use.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I think it necessary to point out that, confronted by this growing public health problem, we must also turn our attention to its underlying causes. The link between obesity and the social environment has been proved many times, the main reason for the link being the cost of food. A French daily newspaper published an article today entitled ‘The rich are slim’.</p>
<p class="contents">If obesity is mainly connected with the excessive consumption of sugar and fat, with fruit and vegetables eaten in correspondingly fewer quantities, it is certainly because of the cost of the latter. Moreover, it is hard to see how, in this respect, things might improve in the future, as it is well known that the overhauled common agricultural policy will lead to sugar, and even fat, being placed on the market at 25% of previous prices – a development that would lead to their wider use in products made by the food processing industry – while the prices of fruit and vegetables will continue to rise, leaving them still far beyond the reach of the poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it would be helpful if European Union food policy could complement health policy, with foodstuffs made accessible to everyone and their prices kept down. Nor should the impact of socio-economic policy be ignored, as the choice of food tends to be determined by households’ purchasing power. While waiting, however, for our policies to be revised, we must lose no time in using our food aid programme to ensure that fruit and vegetables can be supplied to those who need them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It now appears that this new disease affecting industrialised societies is also present in the European Union. As the rapporteur has pointed out, children are the worst affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with all the analyses and statements made in the report. I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that one needs to have access to healthy food if one is to eat healthily. Sadly, healthy food is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the Union. Unfortunately, we have now been held hostage for many years by large agri-food businesses and have been forced to consume what they supply. These large businesses impose a certain type of food production on farmers, leading to the production of ever more food that is ever cheaper and of ever poorer quality. Farmers are encouraged, and indirectly forced, to engage in intensive agriculture. This is detrimental to the environment and to our health.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst other issues, we are today debating obesity and excess weight. Meanwhile, scientists are highlighting an even more alarming situation. They believe that instead of going up, average life expectancy in Europe is going down rapidly. What is even worse is that we are all subsidising the farmers and, in the end, neither we nor they benefit sufficiently from the food produced. Part of the solution to the problems currently under discussion lies in a return to traditional organic farming which, incidentally, is GMO-free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Psychological problems lead to overeating and also create a predisposition towards other addictions triggered by poor self-esteem and frustration, which are caused by a stressful lifestyle and frenzied efforts to achieve financial success and improve one’s material standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Another significant factor responsible for such widespread obesity is unnatural and unhealthy food laced with preservatives and artificially prepared that is now available anywhere and everywhere, 24 hours a day. This disrupts the normal physiological sensations of hunger and satiety. Lack of physical activity due to the mechanisation of daily life also contributes to the aforementioned condition. Awareness of these and other factors should be reinforced by legal provisions. These fall within the competence of Members of Parliament and other decision-makers. It has to be said, however, that labels showing the composition and calorific values of food are not very helpful to a sick person who resorts to food in an attempt to deal with fear or depression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Commission initiative of drawing up a Green Paper on promoting healthy diets and physical activity, in relation to preventing obesity, has been extremely well received by all of the actors involved in the process. That reflects the many facets of the problem and the need to adopt measures that involve society as a whole. All of this is laid out very effectively in Mrs Ries's report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to point out that the European food industry participates in numerous initiatives and has made specific commitments in different areas of promoting healthy diets and lifestyles, within the framework of the European Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, launched by the European Commission in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more such efforts are being made to offer consumers an increasingly wide and varied range of products that meet their needs. We must therefore continue to promote the industry's efforts to innovate, something which will ultimately benefit the consumer. This commitment on the part of the responsible European industry is directly linked to the promotion of healthy diets and lifestyles and is demonstrated in certain examples of self-regulation and marketing. Specifically, in Spain, the industry has signed an agreement to this end with the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, and that agreement is working very well. It involves promoting nutritional education for consumers, healthy diets and, above all, physical activity, which are very important tools in terms of controlling obesity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, however, that there is no such thing as good foods or bad foods as such. Everything can and must be eaten. There are healthy diets and not so healthy diets. It all depends on variety. We must insist on the need to make less use of cars, remote controls, video games and so forth, and forget the idea that the whole problem can be solved by means of prohibitions and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other thing I would like to point out. We must not demonise overweight people, because if we insist too much on this we will be faced with another problem: anorexia, which is much more serious, if that is possible, particularly for young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people suffer psychologically because of other people’s view of them and are at risk of sometimes serious health complications.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out too, obesity affects more than three million children, that is to say one out of every four children in Europe. This statistic should lead us to take action, especially in view of the alarming rate of increase, with almost 400 000 new cases per year. Childhood is a stage of life in which people adopt a large proportion of their eating habits. It is therefore time for the European Union to encourage the Member States – as it is they who are competent in this matter – to take the necessary measures to promote healthy eating and regular physical exercise from childhood onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">As recommended by the report, it is imperative for the measures taken by the Member States to be supplemented by the provision of information to consumers and, in particular, young consumers, by which I mean the implementation – not only in the media but also in schools and, in particular, in school canteens – of campaigns to inform consumers about the problems connected with obesity and to raise their awareness of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also emphasises the essential role of health professionals in detecting the risks of chronic diseases linked to obesity, for example diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases, the consequences of which are particularly serious for people who are overweight. Thanks to their privileged relationship with patients, health professionals can, moreover, help educate and inform people about the risks they run and, in that way, play a crucial role.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the big problems raised here is, as previous speakers have said, the fact that people are not eating enough fruit and vegetables. We all know how essential it is to eat fruit and vegetables and, as the report indicates, people cannot eat them because they are too expensive. Let us therefore propose some practical solutions with a view to preventing this intolerable discrimination in the field of health. It is vital that the European Union support as closely as possible the practical measures taken by the Member States when it comes to health and nutrition, and this with a view considerably to reducing this growing phenomenon of obesity in Europe, particularly among children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For many years now, a number of different countries have been trying to rise to the challenge of healthy eating, physical activity and preventing obesity, excess weight and chronic diseases. Certain firms are doing well promoting miracle products to deal with obesity which actually do more harm than good. Books on various diets state that food is the best cure, whilst there is an increasing number of ‘plump’ people in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that consumers are not very well informed about food and its consequences. Education, the promotion of healthy eating through the mass media and information on packaging, concerning the nutritional value of individual ingredients, should help citizens. I believe all these measures should be supplemented by testing individuals at risk of becoming obese, to show which substances in food tend to accumulate in the body and which ought to be consumed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad to see that we are thinking along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I would like to say that of course we all agree that it is an individual’s choice at the end of the day. We will not put the food on the consumer’s table, and we cannot make them eat or not eat something. But at the same time we have a responsibility to make sure that consumers can make an informed choice, which means education, that is true, but it also means making sure that the information they receive is accurate, truthful, correct and science-based with reference to health claims. I note the call for nutritional labelling. That is something we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make sure that consumers get sufficient, understandable information so that they can make their choices. That goes for the citizens and the parents who have to make choices for their children, and they do have a responsibility to say ‘no’ every now and then. This is also an important factor, because we do not want to ban any food. I should like to make that clear. We do not want to exclude any food from the diet of the consumers. I cannot imagine a child growing up and never having an ice cream or a chocolate bar, but they do not have to have ten a day, and this is a question of moderation. This is a challenge for all of us. I also understand that advertising to children is an important issue. I think the compromise reached when we discussed the Television Without Frontiers Directive is a prudent one, but we are also working, as you know, on self-regulation within the industry to make sure that it is responsible in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always said that it is more practical and much faster to go with self-regulation to a great extent, but we have always said in the Commission that if that does not work, then we will not hesitate to come back and take more binding measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry Mrs Breyer is not here, but I have to say that this Commission has been very ambitious and courageous on many issues – I am referring to tobacco and alcohol and also to raising these issues. You will remember two years ago, when I first started presenting these issues on behalf of the Commission, the reaction that came from various sides. But now we are having this debate. We are now discussing a Green Paper. It is a strategy that will formulate what the next actions are going to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Product reformulation is a very important factor for us. We are working on and studying the issue of trans fatty acids. I can assure you that I know the situation on that. It is a challenge. We have to make sure that if they are removed, nothing worse replaces them. That is something on which we will be working closely with EFSA.</p>
<p class="contents">The factor that we always have to remember is the social dimension, and the issue of inequality when it comes to health harm arising from obesity, because unfortunately, it does mostly affect lower-income families. That is a reality. So we have an increased responsibility to act in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to say that I thank you all again for a very interesting debate. I am looking forward to discussing with you our strategy, once it is presented, and how we can achieve practical results and make it work for the benefit of the European consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for the excellent work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I would just say, however, in response to Mr Martinez’s speech is that it is in Tartuffe, I believe, that Molière tells us that to neglect to respond at a given moment amounts to offering support. I feel obliged to respond, in this House, on behalf of the Commissioner, since Mr Martinez did, after all, use the terms ‘throw up’ and ‘scandalous’ on the subjects of the Green Paper and of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been in this Parliament for seven years, and those are terms that I have never before heard used here. I do not think that this report is particularly controversial or polemical. I think it is fairly consensual, if the speeches made are anything to go by. I therefore totally refute the accusations made or, rather, the insults poured out. It is very clear that Mr Martinez views this scourge only through a North-South prism. That is his own perspective. We do in fact emphasise from the very start – and Mrs Breyer, who is no longer in the House, pointed this out – that, although there are 1 500 million people in the world who suffer from obesity, there are also 800 million who are dying of hunger. To give an example as anecdotal as that used by Mr Martinez, I would also point out that in Micronesia too, in the Samoan Islands, there are people who are obese.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add in conclusion that, when it comes to humanitarian aid and to showing solidarity, neither I nor anyone else need take lessons from someone like Mr Martinez, given the particular corner of the political chessboard that he inhabits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Policies for the prevention and control of overweight, obesity and chronic illness should encompass the entire lifespan from the womb to old age. </p>
<p class="contents">Older persons and those with reduced mobility are more affected by being overweight due to the lack of exercise that leads to ill health. As a result, older people on occasion suffer from cumulative detriments.</p>
<p class="contents">A good example for this is the spread of diabetes all over the world, the treatment of which risks further complications. Older patients often become victims of reduced mobility by necessity in the course of therapy, thus facing the battle not only with their affliction but also with an added impairment to their living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that given its aging population, Europe must put the main emphasis on prevention. But for older people we have to guarantee their right to a chance for a life of human dignity; an indispensable part of that is the right to a healthy life as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to point out that different Member States have different capabilities for prevention. The price of healthy living varies from State to State. At the time of setting up prevention, in the course of identifying underprivileged groups one must look at older and handicapped people and adjust the preventive/rehabilitative programmes as much as possible according to local needs. This can only be achieved if all EU Member States join forces and share their best experiences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The obesity growth rate has indeed already reached a dramatic level within the Union. The issue should therefore be addressed seriously by establishing an EU Action Plan for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Not only have we to cope with the bad consumer habits and the lack of physical activity, but all the economic consequences have to be addressed appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of fact, it has been demonstrated that many deaths and illnesses could be avoided with the use of appropriate diets and daily physical exercise. Not only would lives be saved, but it would help decrease the financial burden on national budgets, as the socio-economic impact of diseases relating to the problems of being overweight is said to account for between 4 and 7% of the Member States’ total health expenditure. The economic consequences of obesity have not yet been fully assessed. Obesity is a genuine disease, a real challenge for the Union, for the health of its citizens, and for consumer habits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that, in the areas where Europe can add real value, such as consumer information (nutrition labelling), we must take real action. Ultimately, the lion’s share of the responsibility falls upon the Member States themselves, in that they have to make an all-out effort to get their people to eat more healthily, and, above all, to take more exercise, for that is at the heart of the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many important things have been said about choosing the right diet and living a more active lifestyle, so I will just mention a few of the less obvious but no less important factors in obesity.</p>
<p class="contents">MSG, which is now in many savoury snacks and processed foods, is increasingly being linked to obesity, especially when eaten by children in their early years of development. Similarly, Aspartame, an artificial sweetener found in many sweet processed foods, is linked with appetite disturbance. Ironically, Aspartame found in many foods labelled ‘diet’ or ‘lite’ can make those who ingest it want to eat more. Both are synthetic chemicals that work by exciting the taste buds. These flavour enhancers can also dull the taste buds, making natural un-enhanced foods unattractive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lack of sleep in children and teenagers has also been identified by a major recent UK study as a primary cause of obesity because of the effect it has on hormones and on metabolism, and a secondary cause because feeling tired encourages kids to snack and discourages them from being physically active. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a chronic illness, it represents a serious moral and financial burden not only for the person in question, but on both his or her family and all of society, and unfortunately we are seeing the number of those affected constantly increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the groups at risk, we have to pay special attention to children, since each year the number of obese children in the EU is increasing by more than 400 000. Of course it is obvious that preventive measures can be taken. But what do we mean by prevention?</p>
<p class="contents">• Providing society, and especially children, with information and adequate education on healthy eating</p>

<p class="contents">We rarely think of consumer protection, yet this is a fundamental tool of prevention. We need to ensure that food labels clearly indicate what percentage of daily nutritional requirements is consumed when eating the item.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of foods with low nutritional value and yet which are high in carbohydrates – such as chocolate, sweetened drinks, and so on – it should be made clearly visible (in the manner of tobacco products) that excessive consumption of these can lead to diabetes and to heart and circulatory disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
