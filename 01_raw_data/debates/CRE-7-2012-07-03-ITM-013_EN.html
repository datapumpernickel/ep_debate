<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jürgen Klute, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like.</p>
<p class="contents">The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, what Mr Klute has just said in the report that he is presenting to you is very important for the fair, humanist dimension of the internal market, which I have often mentioned to you, as it is proof of our shared hope, our shared ambition to bring citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) closer to this large market, even though they feel that this large market was not made for them, but that it was designed only for the big companies. That is why I have made consumer protection one of the priorities within our activities for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">A short time ago, I presented, on behalf of the Commission, three texts which are focused in this direction on investor protection, small investors, savings products, financial products, insurance products and the responsibility of depositaries, three legislative texts which will come to your table and, this evening, we are talking about the same thing: this ambition to regain confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, it is not simply about the confidence of the markets, or the confidence of major financial institutions, or confidence in the price setting mechanism. Of course, those things are important, but today it has more to do with the confidence of citizens, of consumers, who have had many reasons to take issue with or grow tired of too many problems or crises, sometimes even cases of embezzlement in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about confidence, we are talking about the subject that Mr Klute mentions in his report, a subject which is in no way anecdotal: 30 million people in Europe, 7% of the Union’s adult population, do not have a bank account; of those, at least 20% have been deprived or have not dared ask to open or re-open a personal account. Consumers must have access to payment services in order to have their place and play their part in the large European market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome your work and I thank you, Mr Klute. I would also like to thank Ms Gebhardt for her work within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) with several of your colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, as you know, played the game of entering into dialogue and making agreements with the Member States. In the initial stages, which perhaps you found a little long – the consultation and reflection stage – this recommendation by the Commission was only followed partially, or to varying degrees, in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a few of them have put into practice certain guidelines from our recommendation. 10 or so Member States have done nothing at all following the adoption of this text, and some have acted only partially. That is why your report, Mr Klute, comes at the right time to serve as a basis, a very good basis, for the legislative proposals that I will present to you subject to the agreement of the college in November, that is, in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to briefly mention some points that will guide our proposal. Firstly, guaranteed access for persons without a bank account. This is about the beneficiaries, of course, who are at the heart of the matter, that is, persons without access to payment services within a Member State, those who have been denied a bank account because of their social or financial situation, unemployment, debt or even because they are not residents in a Member State where they nonetheless need a bank account – I am thinking of students and seasonal workers. That is who we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to providers, should they all be required to offer basic accounts or should only some of them be required to do so? In that case, how do we determine which ones?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, firstly, we have to study the practical aspects of the different solutions and look at national traditions because what matters here, above all, is that there is real access to basic payment accounts. Beyond that, we must establish quality standards for the content of basic accounts, as you said yourself, Mr Klute. I will not be satisfied with a cut-price basic payment account which does not enable users to carry out the simplest operations needed for day-to-day living. At the same time, we must ensure that we do not make disproportionate demands, but I do not want this basic bank account, which we are going to work on, to be a cut-price account.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of whether or not to include the possibility of an overdraft, I have no preconceived ideas. There are advantages and disadvantages and we are ready to work on the basis of the proposals that Mr Klute wanted to outline.</p>
<p class="contents">The third subject is the principle of affordability. In some Member States, there are basic payment accounts which entail unlimited banking costs. Furthermore, we can see that the banks which offer basic payment accounts often do so at a higher price. Can we then consider affordability to be ensured? I suspect not. I believe in the virtue of a principle of reasonable affordability, which allows for real affordability, more so than a ceiling fixed around a precise, uniform amount.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of reasonable cost should therefore not stop providers from innovating and proposing diversified forms of basic payment accounts, within our common standards of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore quite in favour, honourable Members, of the idea of maintaining a certain amount of flexibility for Member States on the question of prices. We will have to work, and that is what I am doing, on the question of relevant information for consumers and also on possible dispute settlement mechanisms between consumers and professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last important point is the role of the Member States. We need the Member States in order to adopt this text. We must look very closely at what is being done at national level and build on what is being done best. As you know, honourable Members, some Member States are not in favour of this idea or are not enthusiastic about this initiative from the EU. We will therefore have to act in a convincing and determined way and draw up an effective, balanced proposal to persuade them to support our proposal in the Council. In any case, you can, of course, count on my own determination over the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that today, you are showing your determination to submit a legislative proposal by the autumn at the latest, I hope, because we all know that calls to the Commission simply do not achieve anything.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 30 million citizens are waiting to have access to a basic account, so that they can perform the fundamental tasks that are part of life in today’s society. These 30 million citizens are seasonal workers, people on low incomes, the homeless and students, and all of them have a right to a bank account. We need to make sure that they get one.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic account must also be cost-effective. We must not allow these people to be excluded again because of the cost, because they have no address or for some of the other reasons that are often given. We must ensure that they have a right to a bank account, because we cannot accept a situation in our society where there are first and second class citizens. For this reason, I very much hope that you will be able to persuade the College of Commissioners very quickly. We will help you, Mr Barnier, to make sure that the Member States ultimately also agree, because these really are fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should acknowledge that Commissioner Barnier has had a major role in protecting consumers and I am very pleased to hear what he said here this evening in relation to acting on proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven per cent of the adult population within the European Union is a very big number. In my own country, 100 000 adults do not have bank accounts and many of them receive, for example, social welfare payments in cash via post offices; they do not have the option to have it paid into a bank account because they cannot get a bank account. This has implications in this day and age for things like shopping on the Internet, for taking advantage of bargains that become available, for buying tickets, for booking events – things that we all take as the normal way of conducting our business.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on how to reform the banking sector have been going on now for some considerable time, but I think there needs to be more discussion and more consideration of how we get the banks to actually act in favour of individuals and in favour of the public good. Looking, for example, at the enormity of the bank rescue in Ireland, where the government injected or committed EUR 62 billion of public funding to the banks, I think banks should be going out of their way now to show that they have what Commissioner Barnier called that ‘humanist touch’ and should start to take account of people who are suffering and hurting.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very useful if the Commissioner were, at some stage, to give some thought to the idea of how he might encourage the return of traditional bank managers, managers who assess people on their track record, on their character, on their knowledge of the business, on the sort of person they are. There is far too much automaticity in the banking system. We need to get much further back to the human touch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being unable to make normal bank transactions at a reasonable cost is disabling in modern society. Millions of European consumers are currently struggling with this problem. It does not need to be like this, and it should not be like this either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore good that we are now asking the Commission to present a legislative proposal which will grant all consumers in the EU the right to open and use a basic payment account. This is a small reform that will nevertheless help many people.</p>
<p class="contents">Three aspects of this are particularly important. Firstly, all normal, everyday transactions should be included in this type of account. Secondly, the legislation needs to contain a ceiling for how much the basic payment services can cost per year. Without this ceiling, the cost would probably rocket sky high. This new right would then not be of much help. If the service became too expensive, many consumers would not be able to afford to use it in a normal way either.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the legislation should make all payment service providers obliged to offer the basic payment account. That will avoid the social stigmatisation that could arise if commercially less attractive consumers were to be funnelled to any one particular payment service provider.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have not yet done their homework. If that trend continues, we expect a hastily prepared legislative proposal.</p>

Many things become a problem in our society if you do not have access to such an account. Receiving wages, pension payments, paying utility bills and the purchase of products or services all become very difficult if we cannot open a basic bank account. Access to such a payment service is of crucial importance, certainly for disadvantaged and highly mobile consumers and people who are today increasingly on the move between the various countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Erasmus students staying abroad, frontier workers and retired people working part-time in a different country are still too often denied such essential and basic payment services. I am therefore pleased that we and Parliament are increasing pressure on Member States. We are also advocating the option that any consumer who is not able to get a bank account in one Member State <span class="italic">should</span> have access to a bank account in the Member State where he or she resides or carries out a particular job.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is very important that, if Member States take no action, we work towards a binding European legislative proposal before January 2013. In that sense, Parliament would actually partly be following what the Belgian Government did some time ago and, as a result of which, we have had a legislative framework since 2003 that has helped more people gain access to use basic payment services.</p>
<p class="contents">The information that should be distributed about basic payment services is important. Gaining access to them should be a transparent process. We need to examine various systems, as the Commission has announced, but obviously basic banking services must also be comprehensive enough to be inclusive and capable of processing the most basic payments.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to adopt a legislative framework, I would be pleased if both Member States and European bodies worked to ensure that this basic service is not abused. Access should be kept to as wide a segment of the population as possible, but a basic payment account obviously cannot compete unfairly with an ordinary banking service. I am therefore pleased that Member States will hopefully soon be required to provide everyone with access to these basic banking services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know it is a question of students, migrants and the poorest in our society, who are perhaps not the most attractive customers for banks, but that makes it no less important to ensure that they have access to an account, because this is also a tool for active inclusion.</p>

<p class="contents">If you defend this right here, then all of your arguments will follow the line that you are defending a mandatory entitlement, and that something that is a mandatory entitlement must be created. You well know that when we were looking for common ground and a joint compromise in debating Mr Klute’s report, we came up against problems which we were unable to decide on at that time. We were unable to resolve these problems and they will also clearly be difficult to resolve in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not forget, we debated what the fee should be for opening an account, and what the fee should be for managing an account. Is this project restricted only to EU citizens, or is it also for people living in the European area just for a short time? There are a whole series of problems there, on account of which we cannot support the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, having access to basic banking services is not only a condition enabling the single market to function properly, but it is also a requirement for economic and social progress. This access to basic banking services should be provided at the lowest possible cost to the public and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, we are in a banking world where we watch banks committing abuses against the public, especially the uninformed public, in terms of the charges levied for different banking services. In particular, we are in a banking world where we have learnt with dismay that some large banks have even manipulated the way in which the market determines those benchmark interest rates which are used as the base rates in credit contracts with variable interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Romania, as well as in other countries, the banking system is dominated by foreign banks. What do we notice then in these countries? That the charges paid for banking services by citizens in my country and other countries are higher than the charges which these banks levy in their own countries where they have their headquarters. There are also free banking services which are charged for in my country and other countries. This is why I will vote in favour of Mr Klute’s report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me explain. In Wales, there is currently a strong network of credit unions that provide basic banking services to the most disadvantaged group of people in society. They go far beyond simply providing people with bank accounts. They also provide advice and help to those people who have difficulty managing their basic finances. They help those who cannot afford to pay for help to understand financial services and provide a personal relationship manager that the large retail banks will never be in a position to provide; this certainly will not be a commercially viable proposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to bank accounts for everybody is likely to put the business of these credit unions in jeopardy and force them out, so that, while people will end up with a bank account, they will lose all the added value that they are getting from these local institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ms Swinburne and Mr Schmidt mentioned a point that I want to clarify. There is no desire to exclude establishments which are today already aimed at these kinds of people. What we want to propose is the principle of access. We are not appointing providers. This point should therefore be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to thank Ms Gebhardt, and also Mr Ludvigsson, Mr Tarabella, and Mr Daerden for their support and encouragement. Yes, it is indeed a question of having a real banking service for the 7% of the population who are excluded from it, that is, from real services, a real guarantee of access for all citizens living legally in the EU and also very low costs in order to respond to the concern that Ms Băsescu has just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Mitchell and Mr De Backer about the link between this basic bank account and everything that happens in the single electronic market, particularly with regard to paying wages, but also with regard to all e-commerce activities. We also mentioned this question in the Green Paper on electronic payments, which deals with the initiatives that we will propose in the autumn at more or less the same time in order to develop secure, efficient, low-cost payments. This will only produce results if all the citizens of the EU, and not just 93% of them, have a basic bank account.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Gebhardt and Ms Turunen highlighted the fact that we have completed the recommendation stage, which, it seems to me, was too long in their view, but which nonetheless took place over a limited period of time. I have not forgotten that some Member States, such as Belgium, Italy and others, have indeed taken action, but we can clearly see that, for many other Member States, a binding legislative act is needed. That is what I will propose to you in a few weeks’ time. We are very determined and very focused on our plan to offer this access to basic banks accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sanchez Presedo, who is very familiar with these subjects, which worry consumers, as he is rapporteur for the text on mortgage credits, and Mr Stolojan mentioned the economic and social conditions just a moment ago, and Ms Prendergast talked about equity. All of these ideas are covered by this proposal so that all aspects of the internal market, particularly the financial aspects, can be fairer and more human.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I can confirm that we will not stop there. In the autumn, I am going to tackle, through a legislative text, the question of the transparency of banking costs, which this time concerns all consumers and all citizens. Then, there is the question of banking mobility. These are the three points, along with the basic bank account, that we will tackle in this latest package on consumer protection, and particularly protection for the most vulnerable citizens in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please tell the College of Commissioners what you have heard here. You can be sure that you will have our broad support on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are one or two detailed issues that still need discussing, but I feel that we were able to work together very constructively across all the groups in the compromise negotiations.

The Commission’s work programme for 2011 announced that there would be a legislative proposal guaranteeing that all legally resident consumers in the EU had access to basic banking services. There are 30 million EU citizens who are currently denied this. In Austria alone, for example, 150 000 people live in households where no one has a bank account and, for most of them, this is not a voluntary choice. Financial exclusion is a major problem and, therefore, the basic account must be cheap to run. There must be an upper limit for charges which should cover all the basic transactions, so that the citizens of Europe can go about their ordinary everyday business. Mr Barnier, you need to take action. You must persuade the College of Commissioners quickly, so that we can consider this proposal in Parliament soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are persistent differences between interbank fees. There are large differences between the fees charged in different Member States, but also noticeable differences between banks themselves. The consumer is always the first to suffer from the resulting lack of transparency. I therefore believe that the Commission should focus on improving the functioning of the single European payment area and its transparency. The elimination of these problems is, in my opinion, an important building block for consumer confidence in respect of banking services, including the use of bank accounts. A separate chapter is devoted to citizens who, for whatever reason, are unable to open or operate a payment account. Here, the report provides a clear opinion that every consumer across the EU should have a guaranteed right of access to basic banking services, and I fully agree with this. I also welcome the call for access to a basic bank account to be free of charge, or for the costs of access to be reasonable. The use of a basic payment account should not be connected with any form of discrimination in terms of the end consumer. It is equally important for access to a basic payment account not to be conditional on the purchase of any additional services, whether of a financial or non-financial nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
