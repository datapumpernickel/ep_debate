These strategies concerned the transport, energy, agriculture, industry, internal market and development cooperation sectors. The General Affairs, ECOFIN and Fisheries Councils plan to present the three latest relevant strategies to the Barcelona European Council in the spring of 2002. The nine integration strategies must be implemented in the form of sectoral measures, adopted by the majority, through co-decision with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Cardiff process, we must highlight the Lisbon process, which integrates the 1997 Luxembourg social process on employment with the 1999 Cologne macro-economic process, which was given a third dimension in Gothenburg, an environmental dimension, made up of the strategy for sustainable development, which also seeks to achieve integration of the environment into sectoral policies. The European Union will present all this to the Global Summit on Sustainable Development which, as you know, will be held in Johannesburg in September 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">By creating this strategy on sustainable development, the European Council has given priority, in terms of the environment, to climate change, to ecologically viable methods of transport, to the responsible management of natural resources and, lastly, to the management of risks to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst continuing to function independently, the Cardiff process has been assessed and monitored since its launch in 1998, with results which are now integrated into the enlarged framework of the Lisbon process. The implementation of the strategy on sustainable development must, as decided at Gothenburg, be based on four points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is an annual synthesis report by the Commission, which will now concern the three dimensions of the Lisbon process, including the strategy on sustainable development. A report of the same kind will also have to be presented to the Barcelona European Council. The second point is an evaluation and a political direction at the spring European Councils. The third point concerns structural indicators on sustainable development which will be, on the basis of a Commission communication, endorsed by the Council before being submitted to the Laeken European Council. The fourth and final point is a Commission communication on better regulation, which will mean that all the major proposals from this institution will be assessed beforehand for their effects on the strategy on sustainable development, including integration of the environmental dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently working to implement the conclusions of the European Council on the structures of work. These will be designed with particular consideration given to the principles of governance in terms of transparency, stakeholder participation, better methods for regulation and the re-focusing of Community policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, as we saw at Doha, it is difficult, but interesting nonetheless, to integrate environmental policies into a much more multi-lateral context. This is an important step forward, considering our starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a positive aspect and that, in the wake of the Doha Summit, we will now have to make the most of the achievements of Doha and use them within the framework of the measures that are to be implemented at European Union level, so as to ensure that sustainable development not only continues to be an honourable and bold ambition for everyone, but more importantly, translates itself, whilst observing the principle of transparency and following constructive dialogue, into specific measures in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the correspondence between the two parts, what was achieved within a wider forum and what was achieved or is in the process of being achieved at European Union level and, in particular, what must be achieved at the Laeken and Barcelona Councils, should be coherent and should be the milestones of a structural position, that is specific and conducive to the integration of sustainable development in all the policies implemented at Council and European Union level in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council has already taken several measures to combat illegal immigration. The action plans that have been drawn up for the countries and regions producing illegal immigrants and/or asylum seekers, within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, is a good example of one such measure. Another example is that of the rapid alert system that was developed within the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi).</p>
<p class="contents">Measures to improve the effectiveness of checks by Member States at maritime borders were launched as part of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, these measures are now part of the Community acquis. Of course, Member States are responsible for performing these checks, and the surveillance of and checks on territorial waters are therefore a matter of their competence. The Council also stresses that the preparatory bodies are currently looking into introducing a good practice guide, the aim of which is to assist Member States in carrying out these checks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Reference to nationalism in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the horrific terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September and their tragic consequences, people in the United States reacted strongly, with clear expressions of nationalism or patriotism based on the democratic and moral values which underpin North American society. It was out of a similar form of democratic nationalism that most of the current Member States of the European Union were born in the face of despotic power. The fact that certain European states acted in a violent and imperialistic manner and were thus the cause of the tragic wars which have marked Europe's history should in no way detract from the peaceful aspirations which characterise the democratic nationalism to be found in most European countries. It is therefore surprising to note that, in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001, which was held in response to the terrorist attacks against US citizens, the term 'nationalism' is once more used indiscriminately as being equivalent to racism and xenophobia. This is quite clearly offensive to all those Europeans who see themselves as peaceful, democratic and caring members of a nation and part of a national culture, as well as members of the European and world community.</p>

<p class="contents">There has been an enormous upsurge in illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey, with thousands of clandestine immigrants reaching Greek shores aboard Turkish smugglers' boats. The Turkish authorities make no attempt to prevent such immigration, which is in breach of the accession partnership, while the measures taken by the Greek authorities are inadequate to stem the constant flood of illegal immigrants on to Greek territory and, by extension, into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the climate of insecurity created by uncontrolled immigration into the EU, which was intensified by the terrorist attacks in the USA, what is the Council's position on the flow of illegal immigrants from Turkey? What measures will the Council take in regard to Turkey as an applicant for EU accession, pursuant to the conditions laid down in the accession partnership concerning the prevention of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border management with a view to the adoption of the Schengen acquis, in order to prevent illegal immigrants entering Greece and to guarantee the security of the EU's borders? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regarding the measures that it has taken and is continuing to take in this area, the Council kindly asks you to refer to the answers that have already been given to numerous questions submitted by Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration. The Council reiterates that the Helsinki European Council decided to consider Turkey as a candidate country which aims to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria as those that are applied to the other candidate countries. The Helsinki European Council stated that, and I quote, ‘with a view to intensifying the harmonisation of Turkey’s legislation and practice with the acquis, the Commission is invited to prepare a process of analytical examination of the acquis’. In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Commission will report back to the Council on the progress made in preparing the analytical examination of the acquis with Turkey. The Council formally adopted the accession partnership with Turkey on 8 March 2000. Under this accession partnership, Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis, which sets out the framework for the policy to be pursued and the timetable of legislative work, as well as the budgetary and administrative requirements that are necessary in order for Turkey to adopt the Community acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the practice established for all candidate countries, the Commission will assess Turkey’s national programme for adopting the acquis in the 2001 regular report on the basis of the accession partnership. The European Union will closely monitor the implementation of the various measures announced as part of this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The national programme on the acquis contains various measures in the area of justice and home affairs. The main objectives on which progress was made during 2001 include the strengthening of border checks, the harmonisation of legislation and practices concerning visas with the European Union acquis, and, lastly, the adoption of the acquis in the area of immigration in order to prevent illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council again stated its concern given the enormous influx of illegal immigrants from Turkey into Greece or transiting through Greece. The European Union asked Turkey to implement appropriate measures as laid out in the European Union report of November 2000. The EU is also keen to help Turkey financially in pursuing the implementation of the recommended approach, in line with the accession partnership. In this respect, the Council noted with interest Turkey’s intention to waive, in the medium term, the geographical proviso formulated with regard to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also engaged in active dialogue with countries that produce asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration group. As I said earlier in my reply to the question by another Member regarding the Canary Islands, this group, set up by the Council in December 1998, has the task of drawing up action plans for specific countries. In order to draw up these action plans, the group adopted a global, trans-pillar approach, taking into account aspects relating to foreign policy, economic development and also the management of migratory flows. One of the countries chosen for this action plan is Iraq, since it is a country that produces immigrants and which immigrants transit through. Because of its geographical situation, Turkey is obviously an important country of transit. As part of the action plan for Iraq, the Council has already launched a dialogue with Turkey in order to implement the European Union action plan concerning Iraq of 26 January 1998. One of the measures under the action plan is to negotiate a transit agreement with Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Simitis, has said, we are working on an assumption of 260 000 illegal immigrants this year. Tell me, if you can, how two hundred and sixty thousand illegal immigrants can possibly pass through Turkey unnoticed? This being so, exactly what action has the Council taken with respect to Turkey, with its candidate status and partnership agreement, to make it improve its border patrols and prevent these huge numbers of illegal immigrants?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and more importantly, what exactly does the Council have in mind? Is it in a position to design a joined-up policy to ensure that this matter is resolved satisfactorily and that borders and illegal immigration are safely controlled? Of course, political asylum seekers are seeking political asylum, but there still has to be some form of control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, with regard to the more general question of migration, I acknowledge and the Council also freely acknowledges that, due to its geographical situation, Turkey is a country in a peculiar situation. And now, we are all acquainted with the consequences of this situation that you have highlighted. I would like to point out that, under the Belgian Presidency, we have in fact organised, for the first time, a conference, held in Brussels some weeks ago, on the issue of migration. This was a European Conference which was held as part of a necessary investigation into the issue of migratory movements. I think that this debate must run its course, and the Belgian Presidency wanted to launch this, independently of any decisions taken with regard to Turkey or Iraq, as part of the discussions that Europe is holding with both Turkey under the statute that was conferred upon it, and with non-European and non-candidate countries, to attempt to better manage the problems related to these migratory fluctuations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must also emphasise that the age limit is raised systematically, and up to a maximum of six years, in order to take into account family commitments, such as bringing up children, military service or physical handicap. The age limit is also raised in some other cases, in order to meet specific recruitment requirements due to the staff needs or the new requirements of an institution. This was the case, for example, for the recruitment of Nordic language translators and this also happened more recently for posts advertised for political and military staff. The Council’s General Secretariat would not deprive itself of the experience of an older candidate if this experience was indispensable, but it must also ensure that younger staff are recruited to fulfil the permanent tasks of the institution, such as translation or administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, you drew attention to the fact that the process to undertake administrative reform and strengthen inter-institutional cooperation that is underway intends to establish an inter-institutional recruitment office. The question regarding age limit has not been touched upon during the preparatory work carried out to establish this office. The issue is also likely to be raised when reviewing the proposals on the reform of the statute, on which the Council, in its role of legislator, will be asked to comment.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we await the results of this work, which should enable common rules for all the institutions to be drawn up, it does not seem appropriate to change the current practice used by the Council’s General Secretariat in the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade of a career. The practice appears to be in line with the rules of law and is also in the interests of the institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was alerted to this issue of age discrimination in the Council at our previous part-session when I was asked what I thought. My immediate reaction was that, while on the one hand we are trying to encourage fairer treatment of older workers, yet, on the other hand, in one of our own EU institutions – and from what the minister said in more than one – we are discriminating against those aged 45 and over. It is a sad state of affairs when those aged 45 are not considered for employment. What talent, knowledge and experience is lost because of this!</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what measures are being taken to treat all job applications equally? It was interesting to hear about the inter-institutional recruitment office. What is the time-scale for its creation and what common rules will all institutions have?</p>
<p class="contents">I just wish to clarify something you said. The base age has been raised by six years. Does that mean it has been raised to 51 or has 39 been raised to 45? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At its session on 8 and 9 October 2001, the Council reaffirmed that the European Union and its Member States are doing everything possible in order to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries, which must be organised in close collaboration with the HCR and other specialised agencies, the International Red Cross Committee, the United States, neighbouring countries and other partners from multinational organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, the Council reiterated that, faced with the humanitarian crisis, the Community and its Member States have already released EUR 316 million. The Council warmly welcomed the first steps taken by the Commission to assist refugees and has invited the Commission to present further measures as soon as possible. In this respect, I would like to stress that the reserve for urgent aid, which amounts to EUR 25 million, to be used for humanitarian aid to help the Afghan people, was already approved at a budgetary tripartite meeting on 15 October. Furthermore, the Council restated the European Union’s determination to support, when required, a political process launched in Afghanistan, with the support of the United Nations, and to contribute to the reconstruction, modernisation, development and opening up of the country. Current events confirm the need for us to work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is in favour of opening humanitarian corridors but it stresses that this requires the cooperation of the forces in control of the situation on the ground. In this context, the Council deeply regrets that the Taliban regime has, on several occasions, obstructed the delivery of humanitarian aid, harassed NGOs, destroyed humanitarian buildings, refused to cooperate with international institutions and, very recently, demanded that convoys, trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the needy Afghan people, pay road tolls.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current situation in Afghanistan, it is obviously difficult to ensure that any measure can be totally efficient. However, you will no doubt be aware that the European Union, whilst fully supportive of the efforts undertaken to eradicate terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, is taking an active part in the humanitarian operation designed to assist the displaced people in the region. The position of the Council, when faced with such situations, has always been to work to keep displaced populations within the neighbouring regions, in order to facilitate their return, as soon as circumstances allow. I would reiterate that, on 20 July 2001, the Council adopted a directive on the temporary protection, on the territory of Member States, of displaced persons in the event of a massive influx.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this directive will not be applied until December 2002, the Commission stated, at the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September, that it was willing to investigate how the rules specified under this directive could be applied, if necessary, before this date. From this perspective, the Commission has recently requested Member States to provide, on a fortnightly basis to Eurostat, statistical data on asylum requests and illegal entries of Afghan citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not have any information on the conditions in reception centres. And, in relation to this, I would like to say that the Council bodies are currently examining a proposal for a directive to set minimum standards for conditions in reception centres for asylum seekers in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to relations with Turkey, I reiterate that regular meetings take place between the Council bodies and Turkey, as part of the implementation of the action plan for Iraq drawn up by the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, as I also explained in answer to a previous question. The next meeting is most likely to take place towards the end of November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Pakistan is the only country – together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – which has been supporting the Taliban regime. It is a mistake to give the key to, and the administration of, the humanitarian aid to Pakistan. However, that is what is happening, and this political error is the reason why the aid is not reaching all the Afghan beneficiaries who should be receiving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, now that Kabul has been taken, could you please change this so that European Union humanitarian aid is not channelled via Pakistan, as has been the case up to now. Let us not give the key and the administration to Pakistan, but let us do it directly so that it reaches the people of Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Death sentence for 16 Afghans for converting to another religion</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Afghanistan, a prosecutor has brought 16 Afghans before a court in Kabul demanding that they be sentenced to death. They are being charged with conversion from Islam to Christianity, and the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for all of them in accordance with the Taliban regime's Islamic laws. In a trial taking place at the same time in Kabul, eight aid workers with Shelter Now International have been charged with carrying out Christian missionary work. Here, too, the prosecution is calling for all of them to be sentenced to death in accordance with the country's Islamic laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany, the USA and Australia are making diplomatic efforts to protect the eight aid workers' interests and ensure legal certainty. In a previous answer I received in the Chamber, the Commission stated that the three countries had said the European Union therefore does not need to become involved in the case. However, there have been no international diplomatic efforts, on the part either of individual countries or of the European Union, to assist the 16 Afghans who have been charged.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the world, the European Union actively supports the abolition of the death penalty and religious freedom based on tolerance and respect for different beliefs. How is this reflected in the Council's actions in the case of the 16 Afghans who have changed religion? What is the European Union doing, via the Council, to follow and monitor the trial of the 16 Afghans facing the death penalty in Kabul, and to influence its outcome, and what concrete steps have been taken to ensure that they enjoy legal certainty and protection and that their lives are spared? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The position of the Council with regard to the death penalty is well known. The promotion and the respect of fundamental human rights, including the freedom of religion and belief, are an essential part of European Union policy on third countries and are, thus, included in the common position of the European Union on Afghanistan. The main international legal instruments ensure that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right covers the freedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to express, alone or collectively, in public or in private, one’s religion or belief.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has expressed its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Afghanistan on an international stage, particularly to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which all EU Member States supported the draft resolution tabled by Italy on human rights violations in Afghanistan. Given that the EU Member States do not recognise the Taliban government, it is extremely difficult to communicate with them and to gain access to territories under their control. This was also the case before 11 September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The bilateral diplomatic efforts to protect foreign aid workers, which have been made by diplomats from Germany, the United States and Australia from Islamabad, have not yet had any tangible results. Since military action began in Afghanistan on 7 October, it has become even more difficult, of course, to closely monitor the fate of the 16 Afghan citizens mentioned in the honourable Member’s question and to contribute to a political resolution of this matter. Believe me, this is something I regret, but you will also understand that the situation is now even more difficult to assess than before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment? Would she also accept that in my country, Ireland, the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union, because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Would she, during her term of office between now and the end of the year, investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast, including my own area in the west of Ireland, which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet?

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 15 by Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0807_EN.html">H-0807/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 11 July 2001 I asked the Council whether it intended to revise the EU's common position on its relations with Cuba. On 5 September I received a detailed and satisfactory written answer. I also welcome the Belgian Presidency's initiative aimed at resuming the dialogue with Cuba, a country which has shown a strong interest in cooperating with Europe and counts the EU Member States as its main economic partners. Now that the President-in-Office of the Council has visited Havana and conveyed his impressions to the Council, I should like to raise the matter once again. Does it not appear anachronistic and out-of-place that Cuba should be the only Latin American country with which the European Union has not signed any kind of cooperation agreement, largely owing to the EU's current 'common position' on Cuba? Does or does not the Council consider that the time has come to revise and update that common position, which does not reflect the stance taken by each of the Member States towards Cuba, and the text of which appears obsolete, in addition to the fact that it has not had any effect in the direction which its supporters claimed to have expected? Is it correct that, in the current debate within the Council on the revision of the EU's common position on Cuba, there is one national government which is fundamentally opposed to any such revision, thus effectively blocking an updating which is in our view right, urgent and vital? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore hope to seize this opportunity to reiterate several points, and perhaps to clear up some misunderstandings regarding these relations. The European Union’s common position on Cuba remains the basis of the European Union’s policy on this country. As laid down in the Treaty on European Union, common positions are an instrument of the EU’s common, foreign and security policy (see Article 12) and the decisions concerning the common foreign and security policy are taken unanimously (see Article 23).</p>
<p class="contents">At the ninth revision of the common position on Cuba on 25 June, the Council noted that the common position was still valid. The EU’s objectives regarding Cuba are as before: to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this, the Council has always shown its willingness to maintain an open and constructive dialogue on all the issues of common interest. In June, the Council restated its intention to maintain this approach. It also showed a favourable opinion on establishing an open, political dialogue and on finding a future framework agreement on cooperation based on the respect of democratic principles, the principles of human rights and the rule of law. It is also in this spirit that an exploratory mission by the European Union’s troika, led by the deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Louis Michel, visited Havana on 23 and 24 August 2001. Moreover, at the ninth revision of the common position, the Council urged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate, particularly with civil and non-governmental organisations in Cuba, to enable greater numbers of EU players on the ground to contribute more effectively in achieving the objectives of the common position. Furthermore, and as you yourself point out, the Member States of the European Union are Cuba’s main economic partners. However, we must remember that it was the Cuban authorities who broke off dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, when they cancelled the EU’s troika mission at Director-General level, virtually the day before it was due to take place, on 27 and 28 April 2000. It was also the Cuban authorities that, in May 2000, withdrew their request to sign up to the Cotonou agreement. In addition, and as the Council already noted at the ninth revision of the common position, there has so far been no firm indication that the Cuban government has had a change of policy and is moving towards achieving the objectives of the common position. The next meeting between the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs and the EU troika has been scheduled, at Cuba’s request, to run in parallel with the 55th UN General Assembly which is currently underway, and, at this moment in time, I am as yet unable to give you any details of this second meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During that visit, our colleagues spoke to the Cuban authorities, to the church, to NGOs and to the eleven resident Ambassadors of the countries of the Union. All of them, apart from one Ambassador, agreed that the common position is useless, because it does not contribute to the progress of the Cubans nor to the progress of relations between the European Union and Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, must know that that common position has been surpassed, it is obsolete and an anachronism. It is unjust and scandalous that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union does not have any cooperation agreement, which puts it in a difficult position – in the disastrous situation it is in at the moment – in terms of helping with the reconstruction of what was destroyed by Hurricane Michelle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your reply was really very interesting. I was a member of the delegation referred to by Miguel Ángel Martínez and I was able to witness the fact that NGOs, Ambassadors and even the so-called dissidents in Cuba consider the common position to be of little use.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to point out, Madam President, that if there are many Members here who feel the common position relating to Cuba is unjust, it is because, for example, we have a customs agreement with Turkey and we all know that Turkey does not comply with basic human rights. In fact, the Kurdish Member of Parliament, Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize, is in prison, and a European delegation has not been able to visit her over recent days. We also have very special agreements with Morocco, another country which does not comply with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are saying is that the common position relating to Cuba demands that the latter make changes before we reach a cooperation agreement and that is what seems unfair to us, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. We therefore always insist that this review – which is going to be at the last minute – should take account of the opinions of all these people in Cuba, and we also note that two different yardsticks are being used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the Commission’s presentation of the second report on economic and social cohesion, representatives from the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament met last June, at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency of the Council, in Lycksele, in the north of Sweden, in order to share their experiences and discuss the future of depopulated zones, including rural areas, a matter on which the presidency that Belgium assumed this quarter, continues to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that the first thing we must do, at this stage, is to seek to use the full potential of the current regulations in order to combat depopulation and impoverishment of specific rural areas. This task is primarily down to the Member States, which should respect the criteria defined at Community level. Given that the Commission’s proposals for the future programming period are not expected until 2004, the Council believes that it is still too early to launch a new debate on the implementation of European Union policy for rural areas that are depopulated or becoming depopulated, which would extend beyond what is currently in force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Sellafield and the threat of terrorist attacks</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Council, meeting on 21 September 2001 in the wake of the terrible events in the United States, declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe. It has moved to block the funding of terrorist organisations as a decisive aspect of meeting this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">What contingency plans has the Council considered to respond to the threat of attack by terrorists on nuclear installations in the EU, and, in particular, on the Sellafield plant, taking into account the totally unacceptable decision of the British Environment Secretary to give the go-ahead on 3 October 2001 for the opening of the MOX (mixed oxide) plant at Sellafield, formal approval of which had been delayed because of the falsification of records by BNFL? Will it now use its good offices to urge the UK government to rescind its latest decision, will it call on the Commission to intervene in this matter, and does it accept that the only solution is the closure of the Sellafield plant?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Sellafield MOX Fuel Plant</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the UK government’s approval on 3 October 2001 of a new plutonium fuel facility at the Sellafield nuclear complex, will the Council state its position on this proposal, particularly with regard to the security aspects, given that there are worrying reports that such a facility will increase the global trade in plutonium, that such trade will increase the threat to global security, that transportation of 'weapons usable' material makes it vulnerable to terrorists and that the atrocity of 11 September raises the risk that Sellafield could be targeted by terrorists, with catastrophic results for the populations of the UK, Ireland and globally.</p>
<p class="contents">The £470m MOX Plant, built five years ago by the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels plc but not yet operational, has yet to establish that the economic benefits of such a plant outweigh the health and environmental detriments, as it is required to do under EU law.</p>

It is clear from the many meetings that the various Council formations and the European Council have held and will hold on this issue under the Belgian Presidency that the Council attaches a great deal of importance to this fight. From this point of view, we should also reiterate the European Union, in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meetings of 8 and 9 October 2001, reaffirms its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, regarding the two questions that have been asked, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that, overall, measures concerning the physical security of nuclear plants are an area of national competence. Quite aside from the specific circumstances that you mention, the Euratom Treaty specified safeguards of nuclear materials used for civil use in the European Union, in other words, all the measures that enable us to verify that nuclear materials and equipment are not used for anything other than the peaceful purposes for which they are intended. It is up to the Commission to ensure that these provisions and the ensuing Community regulations are implemented, particularly Regulation No 3227/76 concerning the application of the provisions on Euratom safeguards. The Euratom Safeguards Office has the specific task of verifying, by deploying inspectors if necessary, that the operators of nuclear power plants respect the security control obligations enshrined in the treaty, as well as those stipulated in Regulation No 3227/76.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several legally binding instruments at international level, which the United Kingdom and the other Member States are party, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material of 3 March 1980, several provisions of which cover, for example, the theft or other illicit means of obtaining nuclear materials, and which require other Member States that are contracting parties to cooperate and assist the party that is the victim of the crime. More generally, the Treaty on European Union contains provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters among Member States, notably in Article 29.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on this basis that the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council framework decision on the fight against terrorism. This proposal includes provisions drawing up – a list of terrorist offences in Article 3, a list of minimum sentences and penalties in Article 5, as well as provisions on extradition and prosecution in Article 11 and cooperation between Member States in Article 12. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Commission would – as we have requested for years – have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation, they would have found this out some years ago.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Dioxin rules threaten fish in the Baltic</span></p>
<p class="contents">A Commission proposal on the limit values for dioxin in fish could be a death blow to the Swedish fishing industry. According to the Swedish Fisheries Board, the proposal would probably result in a total ban on the sale of salmon and eels from the Baltic. The sale of Baltic-caught herring and small Baltic herring for human consumption would also be at risk. In the worst case two or three thousand fishermen could lose their jobs. Sweden will be hardest hit as Finland and Denmark also have fishing grounds in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important not to act in too much haste in this matter. The Swedish view is that for the time being it would be better to provide dietary advice on how often fish may be eaten, combined with a vigorous campaign against the release of dioxins, than to set limit values. That was regarded as satisfactory in public health terms as the quantities of toxin are extraordinarily low and fish is an important source of nutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Council adjust the Commission proposal to avoid the destruction of much of Sweden’s fishing industry? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
