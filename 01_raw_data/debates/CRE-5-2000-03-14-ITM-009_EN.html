Moreover, Mr President, if I wish to do my job properly, I shall have to return to the committee at 5.45 p.m., as scheduled, in order to present another matter which I am responsible for, to do with the Community support framework for Portugal, while at the same time I must also answer another question in the following debate. I am not very sure, given the joint, or parallel, organisation of our work, how I shall be able to do this properly. I shall do my best, and I am pleased to give you an explanation, keeping in mind that we shall have other opportunities, within the relevant committees, particularly the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to go into this subject, in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer a word of thanks to two of my fellow Commissioners, Frits Bolkestein and Anna Diamantopoulou, for the support they have given me in drawing up this text. I should like to remind you that I announced this text on 26 January when the Commission adopted its formal opinion and its proposals for the reform of the institutions. I did mention before this House our intention to outline and clarify some aspects of this opinion at a later date. A few days ago we did this with regard to the Union’s system of jurisdiction, the role of the Court of Justice and the role of the Court of First Instance. Today we are doing this with regard to an extremely important, delicate and specific subject, the scope of qualified majority voting in certain areas of taxation and social security. Mr President, we shall continue in this way to fuel the debate on the negotiations, particularly on the matter which is of interest to Parliament, the independent European public prosecutor responsible for combating fraud, but also on an extremely important matter, the reorganisation of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the subject which I have to present to you today, let me remind you that the Commission opinion issued on 26 January declared this to be one of the main areas we thought should remain subject to unanimity. We had identified five categories of exceptions to the general rule which we approved, according to which, within the Union, decisions would henceforth be taken by qualified majority vote. We had, however, identified, for institutional reasons, with regard to extremely serious or sensitive issues, five categories of exceptions requiring unanimity. This was one of them. We had also excluded decisions incompatible with the objectives of the internal market or which may give rise to distortions of competition. This is the point we have discussed today in order to complete our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to remind you that the proposals which you are to receive in a few moments, or in a few hours, do not include any transfer of jurisdiction, nor do they constitute an action programme in essence. These proposals concern the methods for decision making in matters of taxation and social security. Having said that, I should like to clarify three misunderstandings which sometimes arise. Firstly, the Commission is not demanding new jurisdiction for taxation and social security. Ever since the Treaty of Rome, the Treaties have provided for Community action in both these areas. Switching from unanimity to qualified majority is not a transfer of jurisdiction. The Commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take VAT as an example. in this matter, we are confronted with an important part of Community legislation which has been developed since the 1970s. The fact that the Council may henceforth update this legislation by qualified majority, in order to take account of the development of, for example, e-commerce, can certainly not be considered a transfer of jurisdiction. the jurisdiction was already in place at Community level. It is only the method of decision making which may change. This is the first point that I wished to make clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is that the Commission does not wish to impose the levelling of national tax systems or social security systems. The matter we wish to deal with is how to maintain what already exists and share it with all the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that in the exercise we are currently involved in, in these negotiations, it is a matter of knowing how the European Union will operate with 18, 20, 25, 27 or even 28 Member States, in order to ensure that each of these states, the ones who are already members and the ones about to join us, may get the most out of the single market, a market whose treaties have made a driving force of the economic and social development of Europe. It is a case, then, of introducing qualified majority where we think it necessary, and leaving unanimous decisions where they are preferable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission wishes to make it clear that this additional presentation does not encompass its entire programme for years to come in all areas. It does not include the measures that the Commission may envisage for the future, or the basic proposals that it intends to put forward at some point. My fellow Commissioners, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Bolkestein, will inform you when the time comes regarding the various aspects of the Commission programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to mention the principles which oriented our approach in the document which you are to receive shortly. Let me say again, unanimity is to remain the general rule. The Commission opinion issued on 26 January considered that, because they reflect the fundamental orientations of the national legislator in matters of economic and social policy and solidarity, taxation and social security are largely decisive in the national political choices of citizens. The Commission therefore considers it justifiable to retain unanimity in these areas as a basic principle. We confirm this approach. Moreover, these national choices are generally – let me specify – generally, neutral with regard to the construction of Europe. This is the first principle. </p>
<p class="contents">But this first principle gives rise to a second, which is as follows: qualified majority to enable measures to be adopted which are more directly linked to the proper operation of the internal market. We know, and you know, that some national legislation in the field of taxation and social security may, by virtue of its content or nature, have repercussions for the operation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the Community must be able to adopt, by qualified majority, those measures which are most directly linked to the proper operation of the internal market. That is the second principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my third principle, we must in future select the best instrument to respect subsidiarity. It may simply be a matter of coordination; it may be a matter of establishing minimum requirements; it may also be a matter, at a higher level, of harmonisation. But this selection of the best instrument must be limited to that which is strictly necessary. Generally speaking, the end goal of measures for which the transition to qualified majority is suggested would not be to harmonise the national legislative systems systematically, but simply to coordinate them. This is in any case, ladies and gentlemen, what has been going on for almost forty years in the field of social security. We also consider it important to introduce it to the field of taxation too.</p>
<p class="contents">Still, before answering your questions, I would like briefly to mention the content of the proposals as you will read them. Regarding direct taxation, we propose the qualified majority in order to coordinate the campaign against fraud and tax evasion and in order to ensure proper handling of situations involving the legislations of several Member States. For the remainder, unanimity shall remain the general rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding indirect taxation, in order to combat fraud, and modernise and simplify the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the light of economic developments, in order to take account of the objectives of the Treaty in environmental matters, we propose to act by qualified majority decisions. We further propose to retain unanimity for decisions on tax rates and the points of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, still on the subject of taxation, in the interests of clarity and legibility we are proposing to combine the provisions for all tax measures in a single article which will be reorganised and rewritten as Article 93. In so doing we are seeking to achieve coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point, this time, regarding the coordination of legislation in matters of social security, we propose qualified majority voting in order to update and adapt the conditions intended to avoid penalising people, not just workers. in addition to workers, there are also, for example, students who move about within the Community. We must avoid penalising them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the minimum requirements for social security, there is one possibility that we propose to extend to social security, which already exists for other areas of social policy, which involves adopting minimum requirements by qualified majority vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let me just say one final word to explain the state of mind I have continued to work in, as we had done under President Prodi in adopting our opinion on 26 January. The Commission undertook to carry out clear, proactive work. We eliminated any ideological thinking. We wish to keep to specific facts and tangible proposals in order to avoid approaching matters with slogans or ideologically.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me confirm, finally, that, in addition to this extra presentation, I shall be returning to this House to give further presentations of the Commission opinion on the whole of the reform of the European institutions prior to enlargement, as we did on 26 January.</p>

The fact that we are getting this rolling presentation of more detailed explanations of issues is very helpful. Secondly, I agree with the Commission that this is indeed an extremely delicate issue. Taxation and social security get to what Mrs Thatcher used to call the nooks and crannies of everyday life. It is something that affects Member States and their people in a very sensitive way and we have to be careful before the Community moves into these fields. From what I hear, the Commission has got it more or less right and I would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to say where the Member States have already accepted a Community competence, in other words where we have already passed a measure, then QMV should apply to adjust that measure. That makes absolute sense. What I was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work. How will that be defined? It sounds fine but how do you define a measure that is essential to make the single market work? That is a matter of intense debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the issue of harmonisation against coordination: one man's coordination can be another's harmonisation and we need clear definitions of what is coordination and what is harmonisation if this is to work. I wish him well in this area because it is an area in which we need a breakthrough. But it is not going to be easy to get an agreement and I would like to see the document in detail before passing judgement on what the Commissioner said this afternoon.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that it is related to the detailed analysis that you will make of the Commission text. The text will, as soon as it has been adopted – as is now the case – be made available towards the end of the afternoon. I took careful note of the reference you made to Mrs Thatcher and I appreciate the concern you feel, in the light of your own country’s particular sensitivity in this matter, in stressing that we must adopt a pragmatic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, ladies and gentlemen, I expressed my concern in this document, and in the discussions we will be having, to avoid ideology, to keep to a precise approach. This is what I said in the course of one of my presentation sessions in one of the national parliaments – your own parliament in Westminster, Mr Martin – and I think I made myself understood. Indeed I believe that this is the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me repeat that our watchword was to say that qualified majority should be extended to everything that directly affected the operation of the internal market and which might compromise its proper operation in an enlarged Europe. We have, of course, worked on the three instruments which I mentioned, coordination, minimum requirements and harmonisation, treating harmonisation as the additional stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to this general answer, with thanks for your remarks, I shall be attentive to your criticisms or your proposals when you have had time to peruse this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would it not be possible to start by making adjustments to the current VAT systems, so that harmonisation systems can be implemented more efficiently at European level? Or another example: double taxation, which causes so many problems. My question is this: will the Commission’s work programme include a schedule for this, or how do you intend to proceed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers. If you are increasing qualified majority voting and therefore taking away the national veto, you are effectively transferring powers from the nation state to the European institutions. I am also very uncomfortable with your statement that you would only seek harmonisation of tax in areas "linked to the single market" because we know that, if that phrase is interpreted liberally – as the European institutions are inclined to do – practically everything can be said to be linked to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Are you aware, Sir, that the leader of the British Conservative Party has said that we have reached the limits of European integration?

You ask me about the Commission’s work programme and I had said, as a precaution, that we had not discussed this matter today, that the Commission had established its work programme and that the Commissioners directly concerned would be coming to address you at the proper time. </p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, you have asked me, broadly speaking, whether the great VAT modernisation project might be adopted with your proposals by qualified majority? I must answer that it depends what you mean by ‘great VAT modernisation project’. More specifically, if you are thinking of the changeover from the transitional arrangements for levying VAT to the final arrangements, which would involve changing the points of taxation, we have clearly indicated that this matter would in any case be decided by unanimous decision, and I can confirm this. As regards modernisation of the system in the light of recent economic developments, and I am thinking in particular of all the implications of globalisation, liberalisation and e-commerce, this is a question that you should ask Mr Bolkestein. Jointly with the Member States, we are currently identifying what should go into this package. A meeting was held on 2 March but, frankly, I think it is rather too early to be able to give you any further details.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have now spoken about updating the VAT system, which means that I can now turn to Mr Helmer and say that I am well aware that these are sensitive issues, I am well aware of the importance accorded to taxation, in the name of national sovereignty, and to the matter of voting upon taxes and, in particular, upon the rates of taxation. After all, I did have a seat in the parliament of my own country for twenty-two years. I should merely like to use the force of my conviction together with you, certainly, and if possible also with the negotiators and Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok, to say to the States which are reluctant and more sensitive than others on this subject, ‘Please pay careful attention before rejecting the application of qualified majority voting to proposals which the Commission has made in a reasonable manner.’ </p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the proper operation of the internal market, and about the success of this internal market and all the countries involved in it, because it is in the interests of all the countries of the Union. But what will happen in a much enlarged Europe, where disparities are even greater than they are at present in social terms and budgetary matters? This is why we recommend an extremely thorough, and I might almost say clinical analysis of these matters, in the interests of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Professor Tsatsos for having mentioned the connection between these proposals and the role of the European Parliament. Since I have been given the opportunity, let me confirm that one of the Commission proposals is to associate codecision directly to all measures decided by qualified majority as soon as legislative measures are involved. It is evident that in these matters affecting the internal market and its proper operation – social security or taxation – there are legitimate grounds for the European Parliament to express its opinion and adopt a position. Professor, we shall have further opportunities to state this and to try to convince the other negotiators of this throughout the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we can limit these changes to the rules on qualified majority voting in connection with the operation of the single market to minimum provisions and to practice developed by the Court of Justice, I believe, in fact, that it may well be possible to implement these changes with the approval of all the countries, which is of course incredibly important. At the same time, I have to conclude that, if the Commission wants to adhere to these three good principles, then it must, at some point or another, disagree with the note which the Presidency has submitted. The Presidency has, of course, tabled the proposal that qualified majority voting should also apply to those areas dealt with in Article 137, paragraph 3, subparagraph 3, concerning the defence of employees’ and employers’ interests, and in Article 137, paragraph. 3, subparagraph 2, concerning the cancellation of contracts of employment. I have difficulty in seeing what the justification is for this on the basis of the three principles which have been laid down and which have been emphasised by the Commission. In the light of this, may I conclude that the Commissioner does not wish to comply with the Presidency’s note on these proposals?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does strike very much at the heart of what is perceived as the national ability to conduct one's affairs. I am thinking in particular of things such as the withholding tax, which it would have been quite unacceptable to have subjected to a QMV regime. I hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through.

This is why I would like to direct two specific questions to the Commissioner. First of all, citizens who are very badly affected by non-intervention are mainly those who wish to enjoy free movement and, more specifically, cross-border workers. Dossiers concerning the coordination of social security, expansion into third countries, supplementary social security systems have all been on the Council’s table for years, untouched. Could the Commissioner tell me if the present issue is also affected by qualified majority voting?

Mr Leinen discussed this, as did Mr Baltas and, just now, Mrs Van Lancker.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one preliminary remark. The purpose of this speech is not, let me repeat, to foreshadow the conditions for the execution of the Commission’s work programme. In order to facilitate the task of reforming the institutions, we wish to distinguish the everyday administration of policies (the normal work of the Commission, and we have regular meetings on the subject) from the reform in the context of the accession of thirteen new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Monti package is related to the proper operation of the internal market. This is why Mr Monti, a few months ago, and now my fellow Commissioner, Frits Bolkestein, continue to make it a political priority. I hope that all these efforts will produce a result before the conclusion of this IGC, before the ratification which will follow the Treaty of Nice, and that we shall have this tax package at our disposal, in the interest of the proper operation of the internal market, before any amendments to the Treaty may be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and a number of you, including Mrs Van Lancker, mentioned the social matters which are extremely important, particularly with regard to third country nationals. We do wish to include them as beneficiaries of social policy (Articles 42 and 137, which are to be subject to qualified majority voting).</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, regardless of ideological considerations, we have reordered the paragraphs of the new Article 137 in order to subject to qualified majority voting everything which affects, from our objective point of view, the proper operation of the internal market: social security and protection of workers, worker protection in the event of cancellation of the work contract, collective representation and defence of the interests of workers, including codetermination, working conditions for third country nationals legally resident on Community territory, and financial contributions for the promotion of employment and job creation without prejudice to the terms of the Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent history of the development of the European Union shows that, in Maastricht, we were aware that creating the single currency would require improved coordination of social measures at European level, but, at the time, we had not yet achieved it. In Amsterdam, as I remember specifically, since I was one of the negotiators of the Treaty almost up to the end, we expanded the definition of the objectives of social policy within the Treaty and the Community was granted its own areas of competence, complementary to those of the Member States. In Nice, prior to the great enlargement, I would ask you, please, to see this text as anticipating events. As we exist right now, we could continue to operate more or less and to live together, but that is not what it is all about. We should form a Community, and I do not feel that we can subsequently come back to this sensitive issue if we do not resolve it now. As I said, we must form a Community of 27 or 28 Member States, despite the much greater disparities. We wish to ensure that the Community has effective means to support this restructuring at Community level. We therefore propose that it should be possible to adopt these minimum requirements by qualified majority vote, and not by unanimity, in all the areas I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to tell Mr Jonckheer that, for all sorts of reasons, I absolutely agree with him on the matter of citizenship. I should like to assure him that, with regard to tax provisions in matters of the environment (many of which are directly connected with the operation of the internal market in addition to citizens’ welfare and quality of life), we are well aware that these issues entail the risk of distortions of competition, which would moreover be exacerbated by enlargement, and we therefore propose that in fact all measures for taxation in matters of the environment should be decided by qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that my answers are necessarily incomplete given the time available. Mr Bolkestein, Mrs Diamantopoulou and myself will have the opportunity to address you again in future. We wish to initiate this debate, and to fuel and feed it on the basis of these proposals, as I undertook, in order to facilitate to some extent, the difficult negotiations within the Intergovernmental Conference. But, in the final analysis, as we all know, what we need is the political will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
