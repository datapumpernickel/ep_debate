<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when the Council Presidency wrote to you on 21 November 2003, we stated clearly that the Council was fully open to dialogue with Parliament on this issue. Moreover, that statement confirmed the offer made by the Greek Presidency, in the person of Mr Papandreou, on 20 June 2003. That is why today’s debate is important, providing us with an opportunity to move forward and to explore the possibility of reaching agreement at last after 25 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Council fully respects the primary role played by the European Parliament in drawing up the Statute for its Members. According to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, it is Parliament’s responsibility to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, which requires unanimity as regards taxation. It is therefore clear that the European Parliament cannot introduce the Statute without the consent of the Council, and the Council cannot approve the Statute unless Parliament puts forward proposals it can accept. It would be as well to remember this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know that many of you are keen to know what the Council's position is on the Statute in general and, more specifically, on a number of proposals which have been made at different levels in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">When Parliament forwarded its proposal for a Statute to the Council last June, it was clear that substantial differences existed between our respective positions, thus preventing the Council from giving its approval. You will remember that, before that, last March, the Greek President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Papandreou, outlined to a Parliamentary delegation the parts of the Statute which were acceptable to the Council and which were not. I regret to say that Parliament's June proposal was too far removed from the Council’s positions and that made it impossible for us to give our approval.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, if I may, outline once again the Council’s position on the key issues. Firstly, the Council is of the unanimous view that we cannot modify primary law by means of the Statute: the aspects relating to primary law will therefore have to be regulated through a different instrument. The Council welcomes the measures recently adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament on the reimbursement of expenses. In the Council’s opinion, this reimbursement must be carried out on the basis of costs actually incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">On taxation of Members of Parliament’s salaries – a point which requires unanimous agreement in the Council for it to be able to give its consent – the provisions regarding the Community tax to be applied to the salaries received by MEPs must not prejudice the entitlement of the Member States to subject these salaries to their national tax system, provided that the salaries are not taxed twice over.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards retirement age, while there was a clear preference in the Council for a retirement age of 65 years, we would, in a constructive spirit of compromise, be prepared to accept a limit of 63 years.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the difficult question of salary, the Council does not have any objection to determining the figure by taking as reference a particular percentage of the salary of a Judge of the Court of Justice, an approach which would solve the problem of annual adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention to the fact that all the positions I have just outlined are the result of lengthy, detailed Council debates that took place a long while before the Parliament approved its Statute on 3 June 2003. As regards some recent initiatives put forward in Parliament, the Italian Presidency has witnessed a positive initial response from all the delegations in the Council. Should these initiatives secure the support of Parliament, we would be closer than never before to agreement on this longstanding issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stressed at the start of my speech, dialogue is the only way to eliminate our differences and the Council is ready for dialogue. For its part, the Italian Presidency has always been willing to find a solution and I know that the incoming Irish Presidency fully endorses this approach.</p>

<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that, after such a drawn-out debate over so many years, we will be faced with the real possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue which has been dragging on for such a long time. I would therefore like once again to acknowledge the effort and work over all this time by Mr Rothley, who has worked in the most dedicated and tenacious fashion in favour of this House, and everybody should be grateful to him.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Commission does not wish to enter into the detailed content of this initiative, since we do not yet have the official proposal. However, perhaps I could remind the honourable Members of the position we adopted following the approval of the Statute last June. At that time the Commission issued an opinion which contained two general observations: firstly, in relation to the provisions of the Statute which are governed by primary law; secondly, with regard to the financial implications of the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first case we said that the provisions of the Statute cannot be modified by means of a fundamental act, on the basis of Article 190 of the Treaty, and in the second case, we indicated that the sums in question would represent a significant burden for category 5 of the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically, all of this referred to a text which was different to the current one. We will now have to see exactly the form the text takes in order to be able to give a detailed opinion. In any event, Mr President, the Commission will always be constructive and of course we fervently hope that an agreement can be reached between the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? If we were to take ourselves and our resolutions really seriously, then this oral question could not be put, and there would certainly be no resolution deviating from the Members’ Statute adopted on 3 June this year. Another reason why we feel ill at ease is that it seems strange that, four days after the collapse of the Intergovernmental Conference on ‘The future of Europe – a European constitution’, we find ourselves, in a request for urgent debate, calling on the Council to agree on a Members’ Statute, even though it has hitherto not done so or shown any desire to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Muted applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The constitution would be more important to us than the Statute, although there is no real connection between the two, but we do this nevertheless, and, all the same, the larger groups are tabling a joint motion for a resolution. Why? We do it because a statute for Members of the European Parliament is not about party-political, national, or individual interests or game-playing; on the contrary, the procedure and content should remain a matter of common concern. We do it, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, because we deeply regret the dishonesty, the tactical considerations, the individual election strategies and the false conceptions of our roles that are involved. The fact is that we are not meant to be engaging in dialogue with one another; it is for you to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">to what we have adopted as a proposal for our Members’ Statute, and because we want to abandon this shared path. It is because we want to make it clear that it is the Council, which represents the national governments, and not this House, that must bear responsibility for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. That is our final offer; our new message to you is that you must, by 15 January, say ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though many of us regard the proposal on taxation as contrary to EU law, unjust and essentially wrong, we put forward this motion as a token of goodwill and of our awareness of the problems in the Council. Taking discussions at national level on pensions into account, we are raising the pensionable age by three years. Although a statute should also govern the functions of a Member of this House, we are dividing it and removing the elements of primary law, but that is where it stops, for we too have our dignity, and those who do not respect themselves will not be respected by others.</p>

I would first of all like to acknowledge the perseverance and tenacity of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not as a member of my group but as a representative of Parliament as a whole, and also the perseverance of the President, because we have been working together for a long time and, before he was President, we had taken certain actions which I would like to remind you of in order to explain the points under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this legislature, after the adoption during the last one of the Rothley report, we created a working group in order to be able to define the most controversial elements of the Statute and I would like to point out that an ex-Secretary of the Council and an ex-Secretary of the Commission participated actively in that working group, as well as other important personalities, because we wanted to deal objectively with an issue with a constitutional dimension. We always talk about the institutions, but people work in the institutions, and we, as representatives of the European citizens, must be equal when it comes to legislating. It is not acceptable that we are creating legislation which is applicable equally to all citizens of the Union when we are in such a different, and in some ways such a questionable situation. In this regard we must recognise that public opinion and the media are right when they make certain criticisms. We must therefore resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution has not been approved – it is true – but during this year – and also with the participation of the Council – we have been able to take a step forward with the approval of the Statute on European Political Parties. And it is not that we are soldiers of the political parties, but we are part of these formations which since the Treaty of Maastricht – when there were recognised – contribute to expressing the Union’s democratic will. Therefore, within this passionate and extremely complex debate, I believe that this is an occasion when – and I hope this is demonstrated in the vote – we have been able to achieve unity in the House – in Parliament – so that we can express ourselves clearly. As the President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out, it falls to us to decide on the Statute which you have to approve.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the step we have taken responds to a philosophy of shared legislative power, which is what we have advocated for legislation in the European Union. In other words, we do not want to do it against your will or in confrontation with the States and that is why Parliament is now stretching out its hand to you in order to be able to resolve this thorny issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the three issues raised – which I hope will be approved in the resolution – which my group advocates, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has been very clear and explicit in relation to primary law, with the reimbursement of expenditure and with taxation. He has also talked about the level of remuneration and I also believe that he has made an interesting observation on the problems it can prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a final issue on which nothing has been explicitly said, but I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has also spoken on behalf of the next Presidency, expressing the Irish Presidency’s desire to continue with a shared will with this process. I therefore believe that before 15 January we may have a positive solution for the Statute, which I believe is one of the most important advances we can achieve in terms of dignifying the work of MEPs and the resolution of one of the Union’s most difficult and complex constitutional issues.</p>

We have said it all before. We say every time 'this is the last chance' and surely this must be it.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I should begin where I left off in this Chamber in June when I offered an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group's abstention and my own national delegation's vote against the then resolution. We said we could not give our support then, due to the inclusion of primary law and the lack of the possibility of national tax. I could say on behalf of my Group that 'we told you so' as now, by and large, the majority of this House seems to have arrived at the same position – so we make progress. But before I sat down last time I also said I hoped that the Council would make a better job of this than we did. Well now we are back, offering the Council a clear and acceptable package.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we all know that the Council did not have a very good weekend. But here is a chance for it to deliver a success story for Europe before the end of this mandate. It may seem a very small success, but its implications for the good name of European democracy are huge. Next summer when we face Europe's citizens in elections we could have a Parliament with its own House in order, its Members across Europe treated and respected equally and on a transparent basis, or we could continue with the current disgraceful mix and muddle which leaves us all open to ridicule.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said it before, and I will say it again. I believe we all come here to work on behalf of Europe's people, not to spend our time in debates about our own pay and status. Council, you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the Union in the eyes of its citizens. Please, please do not mess up this time.</p>

We have always been convinced that we need to establish a Statute that guarantees equal political and financial dignity for the representatives of Europe’s citizens. To this end, we have consistently followed and actively supported all the steps that have led to the current proposal now under discussion in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say, quite clearly, that we are opposed to any delaying tactics. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calls for this Statute to be approved as soon as possible. We feel that the principle of equality between MEPs is a necessary element of justice and transparency for our citizens. Obviously, as is the case for all compromise proposals, we are not entirely satisfied with the one under examination, but we will not fail to make a constructive contribution, which will be open to dialogue between all the Parliamentary groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue that is still a matter of disagreement is the age of retirement. The current proposal is to give MEPs a pension at the age of 63, while the Confederal Group of the European United Left believes that the age should be lowered to 60. This proposal does not aim to protect the privileges of MEPs; we are putting forward the proposal because we are convinced that all European citizens should retire at the age of 60, at the very latest. My colleagues and I have always opposed reform of pension schemes based on an increase in the contributions period, which I consider to be unfair. We are convinced that there are sufficient financial resources to enable all European citizens, including MEPs, who are citizens like everyone else, to retire at the age of 60.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the principle of the single salary, we are convinced that it represents a principle of democracy and equal treatment. Why should an MEP from Estonia be paid far less than a German? At the same time, however, we realise that, in certain Member States of the European Union, this could give rise to untenable situations, where an MEP receives a salary several times greater than that of their President. This is why we have to be politically flexible. Perhaps we could close the gap between differing remuneration of MEPs by basing it on the monthly salaries of senior State offices in that particular country; but, for us, the principle of the single across-the-board salary is an irrevocable one.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the payment of the travelling expenses of MEPs, we would like to remind you that the Bureau<span class="italic"> </span>of the European Parliament has drawn up a proposal that a majority in my group has asked to see put into practice when the Statute comes into force</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One thing that this means is that we want to adopt a basic resolution to the effect that the same provisions apply to all Members of this House, since we all do the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, we will, by adopting this, be taking a decision to put an end to the rules on billing for travelling expenses, which are far from transparent and, in my – our – view, quite simply not right and proper. This is something we must always make clear. By adopting the single statute, we are also voting to do away with reimbursements of travel costs that are utterly absurd. It is important that this should become a matter of public knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are also making it clear that we are intelligent enough to make transitional arrangements possible, so that the enlargement countries will indeed have time to join in this joint arrangement, for it would be absurd if someone, on becoming a Member of the European Parliament, were, overnight, to start earning more than the Prime Minister of a country. This is about opting in rather than opting out, for the same Statute will apply to us all. Precisely when these states’ MEPs join in, will have to be laid down by the Council in the form of intelligent rules – in other words, by an opting-in arrangement. When one is in place, then the future of our statutes will be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members of this House are somewhat outraged at our having stipulated that our entitlement to a pension will begin at the end of our sixty-third year of age. I would have thought that sixty-five would be right, for we should demand of ourselves what we demand, at the present time, of society as a whole, without getting special treatment. I am, therefore, firmly opposed to the idea of reducing the figure adopted in this resolution. To do so would send the wrong message to the public. Let me sum up by saying that all is well that ends well. Many thanks to all those who have lent a hand in this.</p>

Nevertheless, the legal status of the Members is a patchwork that is falling apart on all sides. Pay according to national rules varies to such an extent that it bears no relation to responsibility and workload. At the same time, travel expense reimbursement is running into figures that are increasingly out of proportion to the actual expenses, particularly owing to competition in air transport. At the Amsterdam Summit in June 1997, a legal basis was incorporated into the Treaty enabling Parliament to draft a statute, which was to be adopted by the Council. Now, six-and-a-half years on, that Statute has still not been adopted. With the accession of ten new Member States on<span class="bold"> </span>1 May and the elections next June casting their shadow, it is now make or break time. Do we mean to face the electorate once again with an unjustified system of expense reimbursement and an unaccountable difference in Members’ pay? It seems to me that it is time that we moved on to debate political issues of a different order.</p>
<p class="contents">A common statute for the Members<span class="bold"> </span>from all the Member States<span class="bold"> </span>does justice to the ideal of equal pay for equal responsibility. At the same time, it is at odds with subsidiarity. As far as many members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are concerned, this is reason to retain a nationally determined legal status. At the same time, the whole group wants to see a radical reorganisation of the reimbursement of travel expenses. Year in, year out, our group submits a budget amendment to the effect that reimbursement be based on the travel expenses actually incurred, and every year a majority in this Parliament rejects that proposal. Indisputable as that last point may be, it leads my Dutch fellow Members and me to the conclusion that reimbursement of travel expenses cannot be achieved on its own, but only in combination with a statute. For that reason, we think that the Statute should have been in place long ago. Until recently, that was prevented by the familiar three stumbling blocks, about each of which I shall say a few words.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is primary law, immunity and suchlike: fortunately, the resolutions finally cut this loose. This part inevitably has to go its own way. The Council has repeatedly stated its intention to cooperate on this, and we shall hold it to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the retirement age. It has emerged that, on average, MEPs retire at 62 in practice. In the light of social developments, the age of 63 preferred by the Council is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is national taxation. Years ago, the then Belgian Presidency proposed a compromise enabling us to accommodate subsidiarity on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">One knot that we still have to cut concerns pay. The present national figures include extremes of high and low. As far as the lowest figures are concerned, I assume that, historically, these were not based on a full-time position. In our view, a weighted average of the present 15 figures would represent a sound system of remuneration according to work done. The idea of expressing that as a percentage of the remuneration of a judge of the Court of Justice seems to be a good solution, including where index-linking is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Prime Minister yesterday expressed pride that last weekend’s summit took so many decisions with great energy. As far as we are concerned, the Statute is the test. If this Presidency can report that the Council approves the Statute, it can consider itself a success. If not, it is over to the Irish Presidency. A good start is half the battle. The Irish have demonstrated their capacity for hard work, and therefore I sincerely hope that they will be able to give the green light to the Statute by 15 January. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the Treaty, MEPs are the representatives of their respective nations, and it is therefore by the latter that they must be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the shaky tax compromise at present under discussion is not acceptable. A simple, clear principle is required: MEPs must be subject to the same tax as their fellow citizens. If, by some misfortune, the statute now being discussed were to lead, as may be feared, to an increased parliamentary salary and to reduced income tax; if, moreover, the idea were created that MEPs were escaping the financial controls of their own countries and were becoming employees of Brussels; then I say to you loud and clear that our fellow citizens would not accept this, and the EU’s credibility would be dealt another terrible blow.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments therefore need now to resist pressure from the federalists who want to detach Members of the European Parliament from their respective countries on the pretext of a principle of equality between MEPs that exists nowhere in the Treaties and that is entirely invented. In order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, we must, on the contrary, strengthen the link between MEPs and their nations.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the main parliamentary salary must be paid by the country of origin represented by the MEP. Income tax must be levied on a national basis. Expenses must be reimbursed on the basis of actual costs. Finally, and by way of a compromise, it could be accepted that daily allowances should be considered as a supplementary income paid by the European institutions and subject, therefore, to Community tax. That is the very most we can accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the letters to which reference has been made were in legalese and gave no clear indication of what the Council was prepared to accept; even today, we have heard nothing along these lines. Having heard the Council’s presentation this morning, I can, quite simply, come to no other conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the Council’s position, as it has crystallised over the past months, is dishonest and mendacious; I make no bones about saying that, and I do so with reference to one decisive point, namely the way in which the taxation issue has been handled. The Council accuses this House of taking the Statute as an opportunity to interfere in issues primary legislation, but the Council itself evidently sees nothing problematic in the way it seeks, in this Statute, to deal with such primary law issues as taxes. The question is, therefore: what do you actually want, and how, when you have it, is it meant to work?</p>
<p class="contents">We know from the information given us by all three legal services – Parliament’s, the Council’s and the Commission’s – that what is actually proposed here is contrary to the law, yet this Parliament is nonetheless prepared to go along with it. Here and now, though, I can tell you that, in the event of this resolution being passed and of some Member State or other availing itself of this option, the matter is certain to end up in court – eventually in the European Court of Justice, which will have to hand down a ruling. With the draft resolution that has now been put on the table, I believe we have reached the limit; we can do no more.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier on, Mr Karas was right to say that we too, in this House, have a dignity of our own. I believe that the offer has now been made, and what we are now waiting for is a definite statement of the Council’s position by 15 January at the latest. This is also about what can be expected of our future colleagues, whose nomination processes are currently underway in the Member States. They, too, have to know under what conditions they will be working in future in this Parliament. The deadline, then, is 15 January. By then, we want to know for sure what the Council wants, and what it does not want, or else this statute will have run out of time in the life of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found what it had to say clear and precise. Let me say that the resolution we have produced, and the Italian Presidency’s statements today, make it possible for us to come to an agreement, but please let us do so quickly, for we cannot allow this issue to overshadow the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is this about? After almost a quarter-century of direct elections to the European Parliament, we still have the structure of a parliamentary assembly, but we have to develop into a real parliament, and that is what this Statute is for. Of course, it is only an initial step, which has, of course, to be followed by what has already been laid down in the 1965 Protocol. Only then will we have a real statute for MEPs, and so I appeal to the governments to take this issue up and take it forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that we all know that the current position, with differing salary-related payments and this wretched system for reimbursing travelling expenses, is unsustainable, but let me remind you of a simple truth: these things can only be sorted out together. There will be no Statute unless the way in which travel costs are reimbursed is reformed, but that will not be reformed without a Statute. If you want to detach the one from the other, then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where we need clarity and transparency; that is how we treat with respect those who elect us and by whose money we are paid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this point, to thank all the group chairmen for making it possible to submit a joint resolution, but there are three persons whom I would like to name, without whom we would not have got to where we are, namely the chairman of my group, Mr Barón Crespo, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, and, of course, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox. Following what I hope is the merely temporary collapse of the new constitution, let us, today, send out a very quiet message to the effect that there is perhaps such a thing as progress in Europe after all.</p>

He has paid compliments to other colleagues, so let me pay a very warm compliment to him. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this matter. It is something to be welcomed by us all that, provided the Council keeps its eye on the ball, we shall have a proper Members' Statute before the next elections. It is absolutely critical to these elections. I shall not be a candidate myself, so I speak without a personal interest in the matter. Indeed, I will be 63 when I retire, but not on this pension scheme.</p>

<p class="contents">It is essential to have a proper expenses regime and to have a common salary. I have been rapporteur several times on privileges and immunities under the existing protocol. It must be said that it is an extremely labyrinthine and arcane system and not a satisfactory basis for the privileges and immunities of a House of this kind. Therefore, although this matter is not going to be brought home at this stage, I would echo the proposition that we must work hard in the near future to get the whole issue of privileges and immunities put on a proper footing as well.</p>

Furthermore, after 25 years, it may well also decide on our place of work. Perhaps unlike my colleagues, however, I personally think that it is just fine. There is a genuine problem: public opinion is focusing on us and this system is not working. Of course, I find the word ‘Statute’ a bit pompous. The basic idea was to incorporate into the Statute a genuine charter for MEPs, which would also include the prerogatives of MEPs, a common package that would have given a meaning to the word ‘statute’. If we want the extremely important system of financial provisions for MEPs to progress, let us call it by its name. We should, however, reserve the word ‘statute’ for a time when, like national parliamentarians, we have common rules for the other issues that had also been incorporated – and which today have to be removed, or we imagine they will have to be removed, for a whole series of reasons – but which remain fundamental. Our statute will only be valid when we have provided for prerogatives and functions and for effective equal status with national Members of Parliament, as, for example, in Italy, where MPs can visit prisons whenever they wish.

<p class="contents">Personally, I have to say that, in the course of my long political career, this is one of the few times when I really must express my satisfaction in plain, non-rhetorical terms. I cannot refrain from doing so and I must thank you, Mr President; with this interinstitutional agreement and this Statute, you have, discreetly and without fuss, made a significant contribution to the cause of Parliament. I believe that, if this unanimity we see really does bring results, this will be remembered as an important day.</p>
<p class="contents">Under your guidance, Mr Rothley and I have stubbornly – I would even say pig-headedly – insisted on discussing this issue and putting forward arguments that have prevailed in the end. I believe that the Italian Presidency must take the credit, even though the Constitution has not seen the light of day – if Mr Antonione will allow me to say so, for this point which really is the most relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we could have achieved a result even before 9 December, but this was not fully understood when I convened the committee, on 9/10 December, to force the Council to face up to its responsibilities. We still have time, though, and I believe that, if we are to attribute a fundamental significance to the date of 15 January, we must act now. Personally, I see no problem, if you agree Mr President with convening the committee now for 12 January, in that it would be, Mr Antonione, a clear, transparent and specific act by Parliament. This is the first time I have been in the European Parliament in this legislative period, but I have studied this issue throughout the long process.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part gives autonomy, guarantees, visibility, transparency and unanimity to the rules governing the Members of the European Parliament and to Parliament as a whole. This deals with the amending of primary law. The second part is the necessary organisational section, where we have achieved a balance by way of a compromise that I think does credit to Parliament. It is true that small sacrifices have been made, but the issue now looks fairly clear and acceptable. If, as Mr Rothley has said, the words of the Italian Presidency are now clear, if the Presidency has spoken on behalf of all Member States and all the governments, I think that, on 15 January, after the prior meeting of the committee on 12 January, this major problem can genuinely be resolved and Parliament will have taken a great leap forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate him and recognise his efforts, since he really deserves it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to stress that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission and my colleague, Mr Lehne, have pointed out that respect for primary law includes a very important principle, that of the unity of Community fiscal legislation. In our proposal there is a modification of the exceptional fiscal status, taken up in the so-called ‘Belgian compromise’, which only makes sense in so far as it is a delegation, a kind of opting out with regard to general law, but which cannot be interpreted as a general power before the States to establish taxation on the sums paid by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With this exception, the proposal that the various political groups are now presenting in the European Parliament could effectively represent a step forward in the establishment of unitary status with regard to the European Union. I do not believe that now is the time to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but quite the opposite: we are building a European Union which must be based on common institutions with a common operation, and this is what explains the proposal for European parliamentary statute and a statute for European political parties. It is not a question of granting privileges of any type, but of establishing a situation of equality amongst all the Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can approve the text without any of the amendments presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not want to go over old ground. The current version of the Members' Statute is not perfect – far from it. But in the real world it is probably as good as one can hope to get. From our point of view we British Conservatives have four cardinal principles: firstly salary should be comparable to our national MPs' salaries; secondly we should pay the same tax as our constituents; thirdly the expenses regime should be cleaned up; and finally there should be a clean break with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed salary is not the same as a UK MPs' salary, but the overall package is not dissimilar when all aspects are taken in the round. We shall pay tax on the same basis as our constituents. The expenses regime is going to be cleaned up and, while there is not an entirely clean break with the past, the anomalies are such that I do not assess them to be very great and they will of course waste away over time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we shall vote for it. I would like to conclude by saying to all those who are likely to be the important players in the end game: do not faff about. Let us get the whole matter done and dusted in double quick time! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we can make progress on the Statute, then we can tackle the thorny question of our own expenses. Because of the covert way in which we MEPs are paid expenses, we have left ourselves wide open to criticism. The Statute and the reform of the expenses are inextricably linked; they go hand in hand, as Mr Rothley clearly pointed out. Therefore, while we are asking the Council to make progress on the Statute, I am asking Parliament to make progress on reform of the expenses scheme because, if we bring in a system that is clear, unambiguous and fair as regards our expenses, then we can face the electorate with confidence again next June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can certainly support the principle behind it: to give every MEP the same dignity and, above all, a constant reminder of a single point of reference for the exercise of their mandate, with the same common rights and responsibilities. Many aspects of the proposed law run counter to this principle: the first concerns the time when this law would come into force. In my opinion, rivers of words and of ink have already been spoken and written on the enlargement of the European Union, to support and comment positively on the many facets of the procedure; I do not intend, therefore, to add my positive thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it has not been uncommon, especially recently, for the Community institutions to adopt legislative provisions and with many expressions of regret acknowledging the need to involve the future Member States only in the conciliation phase. Since that is the case, it is difficult to understand why it is a matter of such urgency to adopt the aforementioned Statute, since this would be done without the contribution of MEPs from the future Member States. I mean that we are being deliberately ‘forgetful’. Furthermore, if the principle is one of equality, indeed material equality, it is difficult to understand why MEPs, from whatever State they may be, when carrying out their mandate, which is at least equal to, if not higher than, that of a national MP, may have fewer prerogatives than the latter. In emphasising this point, I am, of course, referring to the national systems that provide the highest guarantees, because I find a system of rights that, in practice, tends to dumb down the guarantees provided for, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, more and it concerns points that are, if you like, less noble, but that also call the concept of dignity into question. Certainly, nobody would object to a single source being responsible for the payment of salaries, but there is no doubt that one of the major problems here is the size of the salaries, that is, the reference to the amount that should, in the future, be paid as against current remuneration, whether this be higher or lower. In terms of ethics within their own country, I cannot see how one could justify a European Parliament Member suddenly receiving a higher, and in some cases much higher, salary, even from a source other than the current one. Similarly I cannot imagine how other Members could contemplate receiving a lower salary than the one they receive today, especially in consideration of the higher salaries received by national MPs, if not, indeed, by regional advisors, in the same State.</p>
<p class="contents">If, for a moment, however, we examine the principle of equality and see it as a positive factor, the concern expressed about taxation would mean falling back again into the trap of extreme disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the compromise on the age of retirement does not seem to be worthy either. The overwhelming majority of the Member States currently set retirement in public organisations at the age of 65 or over. Thus, either we have the courage to ignore the fact that, because the pension scheme for MEPs is practically self-financed, it falls outside the pension costs of each Member State and, for the sake of pure political consistency, we opt for a retirement age limit of 65; or we show similar courage in admitting that the fund is, in substance, of a private nature and that the only valid rules are those dictated by actuarial statistical calculation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in the event that the two other institutions fail to address this, the first to place themselves in a position of subordination will not be Parliament so much as its own Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first observation relates to the difficulty raised by certain Members regarding the difference, in their scandalous judgment, between the pay of an MEP and that of certain political posts in candidate countries. Mr President, I believe that this difficulty makes no sense, because, within the fifteen current Member States there are also differences in income, and we are not for that reason going to establish different pay for each of them. And within each Member State there are regions with different levels of income and, as far as I know, national Members of Parliament are not paid differently according to the region they come from. Therefore, Mr President, it is entirely logical that there should be a single statute and pay should be the same for all the Member States, and observations of this type seem to me to be offensive to the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second observation relates to the idea that MEPs should be paid from the budgets of their respective States. Mr President, this is absurd as well, because if our function is European, our pay should come from the European budget, or are Members of Parliament in the national states paid by their constituency within the State? They are paid by the State as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The third observation, Mr President, relates to the idea we have heard about the homogeneity which must exist between the pay of the European Member of Parliament and the national Member of Parliament. This is also absurd, Mr President, or is it the case that in the Member States a councillor of a small town is paid the same as a councillor of the large city, or a councillor the same as a senator? Each post receives a salary in accordance with its level and its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all the factors for resolving this problem are on the table; the ball is in your court. Resolve them once and for all, because this problem has gone on too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
