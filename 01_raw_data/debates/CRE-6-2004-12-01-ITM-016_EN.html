I am delighted that, despite the late hour, it is still possible to have this debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">You will agree with me that the future of football hinges upon our youth training. If that deteriorates or falls by the wayside, it undermines the game itself. That seems to be a spectre that prophets of doom confront us with, but regrettably, that scenario is far closer than the average football fan could ever imagine. Commissioner, the situation is serious. It is no longer the case that youth players can play up in higher divisions, because their places are increasingly being filled by often cheaper players from outside the European Union or even from within it. This leads to bizarre situations, such the Belgian first division club SK Beveren usually fielding eleven Africans in Belgium’s top football league.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation has a pernicious effect on our football’s social function. After all, you will agree with me that football is an excellent instrument for social integration and against social exclusion. I particularly regret that it is precisely this function of football that is currently being undermined in different European competitions, not only in the Belgian ones, but also elsewhere in Europe. That is particularly regrettable in this day and age. This development is also detrimental to the scope for expansion in competitions, but perhaps we will hear more about this during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of concrete proposals have been tabled to turn the tide and call an end to this development. One of the proposals provides for a regulation which prescribes that clubs must play a minimum number of players who have been trained by their own clubs or in the competitions in which their clubs are involved. I believe that such a measure would give the clubs an enormous boost in terms of the effect they have on young people. Moreover, from a moral point of view, it would be preferable to invest far more in the training side of clubs than in buying players and trading them as pure commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my specific question to the Commissioner whether he approves of this proposal. Commissioner, do you also agree that it is desirable that the government – and I mean both the national and European authorities – should help invest in youth activities and in clubs’ sports facilities? Finally, Commissioner, would you agree that it is necessary to uphold the social fabric of football? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly in the year that will shortly come to an end – the European Year of Education through Sport – we must thoroughly discuss and learn from the knowledge we have gained and the criticisms that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, football is of a very particular importance. It is therefore important to face up to the fact that increasing numbers of young people are being excluded from training or shut out of their normal places in their teams. UEFA’s initiative to call for possible quotas for young players or native players is therefore entirely understandable. I would like to stress the point that these quotas have nothing to do with the racism or xenophobia that we have seen frequently in recent times, but are merely about promoting young sportsmen and sportswomen. I believe they would also help to improve the budgets of certain teams. They do not violate the Bosman judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the argument is often used that there are not enough reliable young players. Perhaps this is because they are treated unfairly by comparison with the other players who are paid high wages. Young players should and must have the chance to develop and make a name for themselves. It should not always be the mathematical or economic aspect which is focused on, as what this is much more about is a responsible way of dealing with young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask the Commission what its opinion is of possible quotas for native players or of investments in local training institutes and the training of players. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People have become powerfully aware of the importance of sport in the European Union and, consequently, it is to receive a legal basis under the new Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral and ethical basis for the sports culture in Europe is the rule of ‘fair play’. The values connected with democracy, equality and solidarity are also of key importance. The European Model of Sport, as it is known, has been structured around these values. It is especially important, as we are in the European Year of Education through Sport, to examine the Commission’s accomplishments in the area of sports culture. The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty in the Member States, which is due to take place soon, places an obligation on the Commission to set about preparations promptly to clarify the legal basis for sport. We have a lot of questions, which await answers. Today, as far as our special subject for debate, football, is concerned, we need action, for example, which will ensure that European competitions are conducted cleanly and that young players are properly protected. We also need action to weed out the unfortunate by-products of sport, such as drugs, racism and football hooliganism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that sports organisations and clubs know their responsibilities. In football one would hope this would mean that there will be special measures in the field of work with junior players in clubs. When we speak of the possible support that society can give to football, support for the work of training clubs should take precedence. Investment from the Union and society is also needed to improve training conditions and build sports facilities for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There are huge differences between football clubs and cultures at European level. Some clubs concentrate on training players and selling them to top clubs, and some on achieving maximum success among the world’s best clubs. As football is a big industry, it is difficult for nation-states or the Union to supervise the selection of players by football clubs. I do not think it is appropriate either. In the case of the players, they who are employed by the football teams, the free movement of European players ...</p>

The social function of sport, which is its more general interest, has been damaged for some years now by the appearance of new phenomena, which have caused the application of fair play, overall action and the development of the sporting ideal to be questioned. Violence at football grounds, following a period of quiet, has revived over the last two years, with new trials for the most beloved of popular sports, football. Hooliganism is now being translated into racism at football grounds where black footballers are playing or in teams to which players from other races are transferred. There are signs of xenophobia and racism in that, apart from the chanting, banners and flags with emblems of the terrible past, full of hatred and incitement to terror, are also making their appearance.</p>
<p class="contents">The spread of doping and financial exploitation in relation to television rights and marketing have turned sport, and football in particular, into a field of competition and conflicting interests. Footballers' contracts in the post-Bosman era have taken on values of huge dimensions. The liberalisation of the market, which initially appeared to benefit clubs, has proven with the passage of time to be an unpleasant surprise, in that the so-called 'national product' has lost out.</p>
<p class="contents">In numerous European countries, especially over the last five years, another phenomenon has emerged which has led very well-known and historic clubs to bankruptcy but not to spending: ambitious plans, vain hopes, unpaid coaches and players, debts reaching as far as FIFA and UEFA.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union of the 25 now faces a different prospect and the entry of the ten new Member States is creating the need for conditional harmonisation in the free movement of football players for the transitional period. UEFA is studying new ways of rescuing and producing new talent. That is why it is essential that the European Union cooperate with the competent ministries of the 25 on the completion of the plan for a national character. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Football is not simply a game which lasts 90 minutes, nor is it a purely business activity. It is, in many cases, the image of the efforts of an entire local society. That is why it is not right for the player transfer system to be based purely and simply on a decision by the Court of Justice which completely ignores the social role of sport.</p>

Nonetheless, the Commission could adopt measures designed to strengthen the ties between footballers and football clubs and the local society, as we heard earlier. The proposal formulated for a minimum number of players, for example, who must come from the area of their team, is important. On the other hand, the concentration of high value players in financially robust teams is weakening the tie between these teams and the societies from which they come and is having an adverse effect on the possible development of the talent of players in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture painted today by numerous big, mainly European teams which, at important football events appear with only one or two players from their country, or even none as we heard a short while ago from Belgium, should be a cause of concern to us. Sport is and must remain the basic axis of social integration and I hope that the Commission will move in this direction. The social and educational character of sport has been emphasised several times and we must promote it as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It strikes me that a much stricter regulation is required on the purchase of young players. We have recently read in the press that players of six and seven years old have been bought by two clubs, Real Madrid and Manchester United. I feel that, in this case, the purchase of young players has gone way too far, even if this is, of course, sanctioned by the families.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that transferring players under the age of 16 should be banned and that priority should be attached to training clubs. Every country has perfectly good training schools, and we must make sure that they are able to keep their young players up to a certain age. Nor can we any longer accept the fact that young African players are brought to the EU on full charters and that only a few are taken on and all of the others completely abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about acknowledging what is happening in our stadia – in Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere – and acknowledging the acts of xenophobia and racism that happen there. I feel that we need to address this issue. This is a question for the Council, although it also concerns the Commission, in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If this requires us to make changes to legislation or to national rules with regard to the support given to football clubs, then so be it. It really irritates me when I hear people complain that clubs like Real Madrid or Manchester United are using their financial power and muscle to the detriment of other clubs. In fact, as we can see, clubs that have spent less money on players than Manchester United or Real Madrid are now ahead of them in their national leagues and doing better than them in the European Champions league. What is really at the heart of this whole argument is what we put in place to ensure that local talent is given the best opportunity to prosper and grow within its own area.</p>
<p class="contents">More important than that – as the Bosman ruling has proved – is to ensure that those who have talent, natural ability and skill are not restricted and can utilise that ability and skill wherever it is most beneficial to them. In reality, the careers of football players are getting shorter and shorter, because of the professionalism and speed of the sport. Therefore they have to make the maximum use of those resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would plead with you to look at the best model and follow that. Do not go with the lowest common denominator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet even during this, the European Year of Education through Sport, which has seen many successful major events, there have been problem areas, for example with regard to football.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Helsinki report, the Commission stated its intention of encouraging legal certainty in football and of cooperating more closely with clubs. The aim of this is to find alternatives to the development of a European transfer system, in which the training of young players is often treated as a secondary consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the European Parliament’s ‘Friends of Football’<span class="italic"> </span>working group, I have spoken with many players, trainers and club and UEFA employees about how to promote clubs’ autonomy and long-term training for players at local, national and international level. In most of Europe’s football leagues it has become the norm to use players who are mediocre, and who were therefore bought cheaply, while blocking promising young ones, who are given far too little time for personal development.</p>
<p class="contents">When wealthy clubs then obtain these talented youngsters for themselves, this leaves the smaller clubs extremely frustrated. In the case of the top teams, it is precisely these talents who then sit on the bench if they fail to achieve rapid sporting success. This is the way in which valuable young talents are burnt out.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means that the initiative that Mr Belet and other Members have launched is extremely important, as much too little is invested in the promotion of new talents in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Figel’, do we need quotas for football teams so that the first team can include at least three self-trained players? Origin, nationality and EU citizenship should play no role in this respect. Or do we need the clubs to voluntarily commit themselves to giving their own young players a chance? I believe that it is not only trainers, clubs and football players that are interested in a solution, but also the millions of fans throughout Europe who identify with creative talents and their carefree style of playing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Football, which is the most popular sport, has a particularly important role in this. The top professional clubs have to lead by example. I have to say I have been very impressed by the work of the professional clubs in my own region in the north-west of England in working to combat exclusion, providing education and providing community leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">One area of great importance where football clubs have to be active is in combating racism and xenophobia. I was delighted to support the ‘Give racism a red card’ campaign in the United Kingdom. We have to keep up that fight. I regret the scenes we have seen recently in Spain, Italy and elsewhere, which show racism in football on the increase again. We must not condone this. It is important that the new Commission takes initiatives in this field and it is important that we make it clear to football clubs that they must not condone the activity of their own fans.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that football is a business and it must be allowed to operate in the same way as any other business. Nor must we forget that – frankly – the old transfer system was akin to serfdom and did no service at all to professional footballers. I hope we would not advocate a return to those days but we have to do everything we can to support plans to bring young people into the game and give them more opportunities than they have at the moment. This is why we need to look at the UEFA proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">But I think that talking about the transfer system is missing the point. The points of key importance in football at the moment are television rights and how they are distributed among television clubs. I would like to hear the Commissioner tell me whether he has any proposals on those rights so the money is more fairly shared between all clubs in football. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sports are an instrument of social cohesion and social inclusion, and also an instrument of community identification. For these reasons we have to promote sports practice and a sports social organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">For stateless nations, community identification through sports becomes very difficult. In the UK this is solved through the existence of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland national teams. In Catalonia we have several national teams that cannot compete in international competitions. Last summer the Catalan national roller hockey team was allowed to participate in the ‘B’ World Championship in Macau. Catalonia was the winner and was supposed to move up automatically to the ‘A’ World Championship. However, the intervention of the Spanish state changed the votes so our national team was not recognised at the meeting in the USA last week.</p>

As a major aspect of entertainment, in which society takes considerable interest, it is appropriate that the EU institutions are aware of developments, even though the football authorities and the clubs take the major responsibility for organising the game.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue raised by this debate is one which the clubs and UEFA have been considering: whether they should encourage young sportsmen to aspire more to a career in the game, whether they have a real prospect of playing for the clubs which train them, or whether – particularly at the top level – it is merely a market for a limited number of world superstars.</p>
<p class="contents">As I understand it, the European Union is not seeking to prescribe employment practices to be followed by professional football clubs but there may be opportunities; observations and recommendations may be made. International competitions also form an important aspect of the public’s enjoyment and interest in the sport. If home-based youngsters are not encouraged, this aspect of the game may well lose out accordingly.</p>

This is a step in the right direction. I also welcome the fact that this question session is being held at the end of the ‘Year of Education through Sport’, as this means that particular emphasis is given to sport’s significance in terms of education, society, health policy and the community, even though we are also aware that it is also a significant economic factor, and more than that besides.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the ‘Year of Education through Sport’, I should like to ask the Commission when we can expect a report on the results and conclusions, in order to continue the debate on this year more intensively than merely with regard to one sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have spent a lot of time discussing the issue of coercion, and I am wondering whether coercion and education are not contradictory terms. I am therefore rather more in favour of voluntary commitment. The European Union cannot take the responsibility away from the teams, the trainers, the paying spectators, the paying members, the members of the public who give their time as referees and linesmen, the sponsors and the state. Should sponsors, members and the state not link their funding to certain developments in sport and in the clubs? I wonder why today’s debate, and UEFA’s proposal, are necessary, while we have the Helsinki report and Parliament’s resolution of 2000? I should therefore like to ask the Commission what it has done with the two reports, what has gone wrong and at which measures it is prepared to have another attempt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope to be there tomorrow for the closing event of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004. So, sport is currently getting a lot of attention, and much action is being taken that could result in some answers to the questions heard here today. This will surely bring more value and political weight to debates about sport in the European Union and also to developments surrounding cooperation.</p>

This includes employment legislation, because in sport and in football there are different dimensions to activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The educational and social value of sport, and football in particular, is reflected in many positions of the Commission and in Parliament. You will remember the Helsinki report and the Nice Declaration on Sport in 2000. We then came up with the idea of making 2004 the Year of Education through Sport. I am sure that we will evaluate experiences, especially as the year draws to a close. As I said, the closing ceremony will take place tomorrow. I hope to come back soon with some evaluations and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, the draft Constitution gives us a much wider legal basis for activities. Once it is ratified, we will work on European sport policy.

We do not have flexibility in explanation of Community legislation, that is the Court of Justice’s responsibility. There is jurisdiction on judgments that are quite clear for some practices. Until now we have had no formal requests. The Commission cannot give guarantees on the compatibility of specific practices with the Treaty. The Commission does not have the power to authorise any practices that are contrary to the Treaty.</p>
