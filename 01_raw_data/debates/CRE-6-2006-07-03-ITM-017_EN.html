<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andrzej Jan Szejna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, this own-initiative report on recent activities and prospects concerning company law aims to react to steps taken by the Commission, as well as to work out a strategic plan for Parliament concerning further actions in the field of company law. Significant progress has been made in implementing the 2003 Action Plan. However, further action is needed aimed at achieving the targets set out in the amended Lisbon Strategy, at committing ourselves to increasing growth and employment, at strengthening and increasing competitiveness in industry and improving conditions for entrepreneurship, and at supporting the ‘Social Europe’ project.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament calls on the Commission to guarantee that the steps taken to modernise company law and corporate governance are, and will be, in line with legislation in related sectors. It also emphasises the importance of taking into account the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the principle of entrepreneurial freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament calls on the Commission to make a decision concerning further measures aimed at developing company law, and in doing so to consider the European social model, especially the involvement of employees. Better regulation and simplification of legislation are very important in order to increase cohesion and clarity of Community legislation, especially in the field of company law. However, this should not be the only aim. First of all, we should define the areas where further initiatives are necessary at a European Union level in order to achieve the previously mentioned goals. We should investigate whether there is a need to consolidate the whole of company law in a single legal document or whether the first stage of the consolidation process should only cover certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s decision to withdraw some draft legislation, in fields where it should already have noted the interest expressed by the companies concerned, cannot be justified by the need for better legislation. The European Parliament should be constantly involved in drawing up, defining and adopting measures aimed at simplifying legislation. The European framework for corporate governance should create the appropriate institutional conditions to support long-term viability for companies and employment prospects, define mechanisms preventing bad management and guarantee transparency and responsibility in terms of investments and revenue. We should also not forget that workers represent human capital for a company. Employees are not only important in terms of contracts, but are also investors and European Union citizens. Employees should be viewed in the same way as shareholders, as people involved in the company in the sense that they also bear a risk related to decisions made concerning the company.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in future draft legislation and revisions of existing legislation and to remember that they create jobs and are a motor for economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of company law, the European Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Commission concerning the Parliament and Council Directive on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies having their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market. The European Parliament also welcomes agreements relating to matters including the proposal on the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive as regards the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital and the proposal relating to the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive on the annual accounts of certain types of companies and on consolidated financial reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should always take part in the debate on setting further priorities in the field of company law and corporate governance. This means, amongst other things, that Parliament should be regularly informed about expert group discussions. In the field of company law, Parliament expects the Commission firstly to guarantee companies a choice of different management systems, including the chance to choose between a monoist and dualist system without the need to adopt legislation defining the rights and obligations of the company’s management. Secondly, Parliament expects the Commission to analyse the opportunities for amending the principles of the European Company Statute concerning the creation of such companies, with the aim of simplifying them and adapting them to the requirements of the market. Thirdly, it expects the Commission to put forward a proposal on the European Private Company to fulfil the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament deplores the fact that the Commission has already taken a decision to withdraw two proposals: the proposal for a regulation on the European Association Statute and the proposal for a regulation on the European Mutual Company Statute, as well as two proposals for directives complementing these statutes with respect to the participation of workers. We note, however, that in the Commission’s 2003 Action Plan, the Commission announced its intention to provide active support for the legislative process in relation to these statutes.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to draw up new legislation on the European Mutual Company Statute and on the European Association Statute. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to present, in the near future, a proposal concerning the Fourteenth Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered offices of limited liability companies. The European Parliament expects the Commission, if appropriate, only to put forward draft legislation concerning the principle of ‘one share, one vote’ following the revision of the Parliament and Council Directive on takeover bids.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the draftsman of an opinion, Mr Lehne, whose excellent comments increased the value of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is timely, as we have just finalised our consultation on future priorities for the Action Plan on Company Law and Corporate Governance. Our detailed report on that consultation will be available on the Internet shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank Mr Szejna and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Lehne and colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efforts they have put into this piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our consultation has been successful. We received more than 250 replies and around 300 people actively participated in our public hearing on 3 May. The views expressed in the replies to the public consultation were confirmed at the hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main lessons of the consultation? Firstly, there was overwhelming support among stakeholders for the application of the ‘Better Regulation’ principles. Respondents praised the consultation exercise. They supported the commitment to the strict application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. They also welcomed the Commission’s commitment to undertake systematic regulatory impact assessments before any potential legislative initiative. A majority of respondents supported the objective of simplification. However, most stakeholders considered a recasting exercise inappropriate. Stakeholders do not want us to take the risk of opening a Pandora’s box. A codification or consolidation exercise would seem to be the most appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards the continued relevance of the Action Plan, and in particular the measures proposed, respondents generally supported the work done since 2003. However, opinions were split on the details of the measures proposed for the medium and long term. A number of respondents expressed ‘regulatory fatigue’.</p>
<p class="contents">However the general opinion was that work should continue on enabling legislation that would enhance the mobility of companies in the European Union or facilitate company restructuring. The vast majority of respondents called for the adoption of a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices. A large number of respondents also called on the Commission to table a proposal for a European Private Company Statute. In addition, a large number of stakeholders wanted to see more focus on small firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when it came to the detail of the measures proposed in the Action Plan in the field of corporate governance, views were split. There was general support for exploring certain issues at EU level, for example the issue of ‘one share, one vote’, at least by carrying out a fact-finding study, or the rights of shareholders. Views were more qualified on the disclosure of institutional investors’ voting policies. There was clear opposition to the adoption of an EU wrongful trading rule, as well as to potential harmonisation of the legislation on directors’ disqualification.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report provides the Commission with very useful input for the development of a strategic perspective for further action. You underscore the trends observed during the consultation exercise on the need to have more regard to the needs of small firms, the call for a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices and the opposition to the adoption of a European initiative in the field of wrongful trading rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early at this stage for us to respond in detail to all the issues raised in this exercise. I have heard the views expressed. On the basis of the outcome of the consultation and of the report discussed today, we intend soon to publish a statement in which we will indicate our priorities for the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Our views are mostly convergent. I welcome that. The Commission and Parliament must work hand in hand if we want to develop a regulatory framework that makes a difference in strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely significant report, because it makes clear from the parliamentary perspective the priorities we still wish to pursue in implementing the rump of the old action plan on company law in this legislative term and shows how far we intend to push the Commission to present concrete proposals in the course of the present term.</p>
<p class="contents">In the policy debate, I was not surprised to see that there was broad agreement, not only between the large political groups but among the smaller groups too, on the substance of the reports, which were adopted by large majorities in both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, subsequently, in the Committee on Legal Affairs. In the view of my group, this is also a compelling reason for us to reject all the amendments that have been tabled in the intervening period for the reading in plenary. The report is good as it stands and should not be watered down by amendments that may also scupper previous compromises. This is why we in the PPE-DE Group cannot support the amendments that are now on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add a comment on the subject of ‘one share, one vote’. There were differences on this point, not only in the debate within the Committee on Economic Affairs but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs. At the time when we negotiated the Takeover Directive, we became aware of these differences. Even then, we managed to find a reasonable consensus. The consensus view is quite simply that we should wait first of all for any studies that have been commissioned and then wait for the evaluation of the Takeover Directive in 2012/2013. At the end of the next legislative term, a decision can be taken as to whether further proposals need to be made. This is a good example of a sound compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion let me reiterate my thanks to everyone involved. This is a good report that merits a large parliamentary majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report, which does not really fit into the series of diverse reports on company law that have previously been adopted in this House, especially as it enjoys a sort of special status through having been drafted on the initiative of a parliamentary committee, helps to fill a genuine gap, and the Commission should now fill that gap completely in the coming years with initiatives of its own. We eagerly await the Commissioner’s statement on the next steps in the realm of company law, because, as we all know, European company law is an important element of the single European market and an important instrument for the continuing integration of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the policy we are pursuing here is one which directly creates jobs. Jobs can only be created in really large numbers if SMEs receive special support. And SMEs can derive particular benefit from this form of company law because it lowers their consultancy costs and because a harmonised legal form would make it easier to start up a business, which we also want to encourage on a cross-border basis – as you said, Commissioner – by improving mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe it is right that the Commission should take initiatives to simplify the creation of European private companies in future. There is already Mr Lehne’s project, of course, to have Parliament foster the Commission’s activities by means of a motion for a legislative resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the proposal to introduce a European private company, which was contained in the action plan back in 2003, is now to be resurrected. The amendments contained in this report, which focus especially on accounting standards, are extremely important in my opinion, and I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give these amendments due consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this field, Commissioner, you are really in quite a paradoxical situation. Since May 2003 you have had an action plan that would enable you to influence this debate, which is taking place in all the Member States. The reality is, however, that the speed at which the Commission works is such that, during that time, each Member State has been preparing for European negotiations. So rather than initiate a European process on subjects that are new, you allow the Member States time to adopt their own proposals, which then makes the development of European governance more complicated. Especially since it is a subject where the transatlantic dimension must not be underestimated and Europe would be better prepared if it were more advanced in the development of that European governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a little surprised at my colleague Mr Lehne’s reaction to the amendments that have been proposed – but he is not listening to me, so I shall have to go and tell him afterwards – when he says that adopting such and such an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would dilute this report a little more. I believe adding one or two useful references for corporate governance to the draft resolution’s 47 paragraphs deserves to be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the double voting right is concerned, I for my part believe that the balance we found in the takeover bids directive was satisfactory. Unlike the Commissioner, I do not propose reopening that debate, especially since the question is not whether one national model or another is reprehensible but rather how a body of citizen shareholders can be put in place that will get us away from the volatile and stateless nature of today’s shareholder in the largest quoted undertakings. We should be encouraging long-term shareholding, employee shareholding and transparency of directors’ pay.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where your energies should be directed, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my work as a lawyer, I have frequently encountered problems resulting from the failure to adapt company law and corporate governance to reality. I think that the Lisbon Strategy guidelines have contributed significantly to the progress made in work on this subject. We cannot underplay the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the best motor for economies. It is therefore comforting to see that the Commission has also noticed the need to create the best possible environment for precisely this kind of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to pay particular attention to an appropriate analysis of these environments. All barriers, including administrative ones, should be removed as soon as possible. I agree that the report we are debating should set out a plan for further action by the European Parliament concerning activities in the field of company law. There were no particular difficulties involved in implementing the 2003 Action Plan. Its main aims, such as increasing the effectiveness or competitiveness of companies and strengthening the rights of shareholders, are still relevant today.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must take further action aimed at achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, namely by showing our commitment to increasing employment, increasing competitiveness in industry and improving the conditions for entrepreneurship as well as, and this is particularly important, our commitment to supporting what is known as ‘Social Europe’. The Commission should not delay in presenting a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer abroad of registered offices of limited liability companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparency and public scrutiny are often good tools for achieving these things. Politicians often have a tendency to believe that companies are public institutions owned by themselves, but that is not the case. Companies are property, and they belong to their owners, not to politicians. Ownership is the very basis of the market economy. Do not allow market forces to be eliminated. If the ground rules are changed, businesses suffer, as does everyone. Businesses need fixed, long-term ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern regarding the matter on today’s agenda relates to the rules governing voting rights. The Member States have different models for taking care of companies’ interest in developing their business, which is to say entrepreneurs’ interests. Sweden has a model guaranteed in the compromise we reached in April 2004. I should appreciate it if Mr Lehne too listened to what is being said.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore less delighted about the external study that is to review the rules governing voting rights because experience shows that such studies have a tendency to be rather one-sided. The fact that objectivity has been included among the demands made of the working party does in fact indicate a lack of confidence right from the start. There can be no guarantee of objectivity. It would therefore be appropriate to have representatives of the Nordic system in this working party so that any kind of result that is finally produced might inspire confidence in the people of the Nordic countries. This is a matter to which I should like Mr Lehne to pay a bit of attention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that this is an own-initiative report, but it should not be used in such a way as to block development after 2012. If large countries retain their cross-ownership and their rules on voting rights, small countries should be able to do so too. We have a deal, and it must be honoured. There is nothing to say that it must be abandoned in 2012. Instead, it can be renewed. Pacta sunt servanda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group could have quite happily added a whole load of things, but we whittled them down to a few points only, namely those also indicated by Mr Lehne, whom I should like to thank for his willingness to compromise. Like Mrs Berès, though, I think that what we have added to the amendments for the plenary is not in conflict with that compromise. I shall return to this point in isolation later.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Szejna has opted for a wide approach, which appeals to me. Unlike Mrs Cederschiöld, I think it important – and that was also subject of the debate that was held earlier this evening – that enterprises should not simply be the property of shareholders. Shareholders have shares, but enterprises are more than simply a piece of paper or an investment object. Enterprises function in the real economy where interests other than those of shareholders are at play.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should particularly like to stress recital F and general point 3, the section concerning employee participation in corporate decision-making and the thesis that is expressed in this report that this should also form an integral part of corporate governance and of company law. I hope that Mr McCreevy can agree with Parliament on this and can ensure that this will also play an important part in future dossiers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the fact that it is of major importance that this cannot be circumvented by, for example, the European company and a change of office, we have tabled a number of amendments to that effect. I hope that Mr Lehne will revisit this issue – even though he does not seem to be listening at the moment – to see if he can support those. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had the opportunity to cover some of the ground two weeks ago when I met the Committee on Legal Affairs to discuss the annual policy strategy. Let me repeat that I welcome the report as Parliament’s contribution to setting priorities and developing a strategic perspective for further action. As I said, we shall shortly be publicising how we will carry forward the priorities identified.</p>
<p class="contents">Some issues were raised and I note in particular the difference of opinion on a number of areas, for example as regards ‘one share, one vote’. I am very conscious of the debate that took place on this matter before I became a Commissioner, and Mr Lehne’s advice that we should await the publication of the study is probably best.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back over what has been said here and the great debate that has taken place previously on this issue, I think this has emphasised that throughout Europe there are different cultures and a different ethos regarding both company law and corporate governance. That is a fact that we should all bear in mind, as I will certainly do in whatever I recommend in this particular area. I think that was also brought home by what other speakers said, such as Mrs Berès, who spoke of moving towards a certain degree of European harmonisation in some of these areas. It would be very difficult to harmonise company law measures in the European Union because of the different cultures and traditions and the different ways that have developed in many of the Member States. The situation is not the same in every Member State, and I shall certainly be taking that into account in whatever proposals I bring forward and in whatever I decide is the best and most effective way to do things on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember the different areas of conflict that we have had in the past and I certainly will take them into account too in whatever recommendations I bring forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
