<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>– <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly those of you from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, tomorrow's decision on the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with a Balkan country is also a big step for the European Parliament towards integrating the Balkan region into the European Union, especially as regards Macedonia's membership. It is not by chance that Macedonia is the first country we are signing an agreement of this kind with. Ever since it was created, this country has been extremely cooperative and constructive towards its neighbours and consequently also towards the European Union. All governments have endeavoured to give minorities, especially the large Albanian minority, a share of social and political power. This has certainly not happened without various debates and problems. Furthermore, the international community, including this Parliament, have helped to meet some of the compelling needs of the Albanian population, particularly in the area of higher education, not least by establishing the University of Tetovo.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can understand that the Albanian population in Macedonia does not think that this sequence of events is enough. But what I cannot understand and will not accept – and what none of us should accept – is that extremists and terrorists should use those aspirations that have not yet been met as an excuse for attacks and for murder.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must resolutely condemn these methods of achieving political objectives, which are totally inappropriate in a democracy. In a democracy, no one should bring bombs and murder to the negotiating table. Violence and terror tactics should not be rewarded. It is, of course, necessary to build on what those in positions of political power, and not least the current government and President, have achieved since Macedonia's independence in terms of integrating minorities, by taking further steps so as not to jeopardise the internal stability of this country. The Albanian minority is certainly a special case because of its size, but this should not result in further discrimination against smaller minorities. Greater recognition of the Albanian language and a gradual but qualitatively justifiable and comprehensible increase in the share of teachers, judges, police officers and administrative officials is certainly called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the provisions of the constitution have also been called into doubt. I do not want to give any advice here as to whether and how the constitution should be amended. But after all the positive and negative experience with emphasising the ethnic question, the inalienable individual and personal rights of every person, that is of every single citizen of Macedonia, should be the top priority, with special arrangements for ethnic reasons being accorded a lower priority. As I see it, we in the European Union should not be promoting or supporting any division of this society along ethnic lines.</p>
<p class="contents">A newly shaped and improved relationship between the Slavic Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority is dependent on a greater desire for tolerance and acceptance on both sides, and also on integration and solidarity. I say this because segregation and mere cool coexistence under a very shaky roof are not the ideal conditions for developing a joint state. Alongside the need for regional cooperation and free movement across borders it is also important to shape the joint state of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">During my many visits to the Balkans, generally together with Doris Pack, I have scarcely met anyone who dreams of a Greater Albania. However, the Albanian population of Macedonia, who belong to a people which is represented in several different states, needs to be particularly sensitive in how it takes account of doubts and fears about this idea. What is more, the political leaders of this society should not cave in under threats from extremists and terrorists. Furthermore, I believe that all Macedonian politicians should work – and work together – on solving the country's urgent economic and social problems, because unemployment, poverty and poor prospects, particularly amongst the young, always make young people easy victims of the lure of extremism. The agreement that we are to decide upon tomorrow will particularly help to solve the economic and social problems of this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Extremists will not bring Macedonia closer to Europe – just the opposite. That would not help anyone except the extremists themselves. In view of the most recent events I would like to say, however, that the same applies to the counter-violence that is already becoming apparent, and which also benefits no one but extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call upon all responsible politicians in Macedonia to summon up sufficient courage to implement the necessary reforms. But I would also particularly like to thank the representatives of the European Union, Javier Solana, Chris Patten, and the Commission representative in Skopje for their commitment. Macedonia can solve its current problems by working with the European Union and in return we can certainly find better solutions to the problems of this region by working with Macedonia. On that note, I wish every success not only to the agreement but also to Macedonia itself in tackling this difficult task.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could actually say that Johannes Swoboda has said it all. I could say exactly that. However, perhaps I can highlight some slightly different points. The speed with which we are acting is also due to the fact that we simply want to show that Parliament is backing this country, Macedonia, and we also want to help it to overcome the current crisis as quickly as possible. Of course we are also pleased that in Macedonia this House has totally subscribed to the European ideal and given its assent to this agreement. This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also make it clear in Macedonia that this Union is a Union of values. We do not always observe them all, but these values include a high level of tolerance, a high level of respect for others and a great commitment to protecting minorities. That is why I believe that in Macedonia it is necessary to work together, across party political lines, taking account of this tolerance threshold. We need to fight together against criminality. I deeply regret, in particular, the death of four Macedonian soldiers in the last few days. So we need to fight together against criminals and agitators. Everyone should distance themselves from these actions and condemn them, work towards a climate of tolerance, and do everything to promote it, in all the media as well as in the Macedonian Parliament and in Macedonian society.</p>
<p class="contents">Albanian terrorism must be condemned, but Slav-Macedonian nationalism is not an appropriate response to it. I think Johannes Swoboda said that too, but perhaps he did not say it as emphatically as I have done. Reason must make its entry on the Macedonian stage and that is why I believe it is the duty of all politicians to sweep aside any grounds for such actions, be they perceived or genuine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Albanian population is nowhere near having had appropriate access to public office and has not had a public presence which would enable it, with justification, to reject any attack on the fragile inter-ethnic balance. This is partly a legacy of the communist past, but it is also partly attributable to the fact that in recent years insufficient efforts have been made to enhance this inter-ethnic balance. In my conversations with former President Kligorov he repeatedly told me that he recognised this and was seeking to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say, however, that the former government did not necessarily pay sufficient heed to these appeals. So it is all the more incomprehensible that after the admirable way the Kosovo crisis was handled, when the entire Macedonian people, both Slavic Macedonians and Albanians, genuinely accepted the refugees in a truly commendable way, that just at this moment when Albanians are occupying key ministerial posts, when the law on higher education has been passed, when the fate of the University of Tetovo has been resolved with assistance from us and with the help of other states through additional funding, and the academic year can actually start, that just at this moment an explosive situation should arise. I believe that this is happening not so much for genuine political and rational reasons, but rather to keep a real trouble spot alive so that terrorists can strengthen their hand.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that all reasonable politicians in Macedonia will, in view of the new European window of opportunity opened up by this agreement, jointly launch yet more initiatives to achieve a functioning Macedonian society. But I would also like to appeal to the international community, to UNMIK and to KFOR, to do everything possible to help Macedonia by pursuing a better and more consistent policy in Kosovo, because the dissatisfaction there is releasing ever more terrorist potential.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many areas of policy in Macedonia where assistance is needed. We should help them in the field of criminal jurisdiction, with their problems of corruption and also of trafficking in human beings, which is also a major problem throughout the region. I particularly welcome the fact that the border agreement with Yugoslavia was the first to be concluded in the region. I would also, amongst other things, like to see media representatives being trained so that they are worthy of that name and do not unnecessarily pour oil on the fire. I would also like to see the politicians who are here today and their colleagues doing everything in their power to ensure that their youth can in future stay in their country, because it is their future. But they need jobs and they need prospects. That is why we very much welcome the fact that the five regional Enterprise Promotion Centres<span class="italic"> </span>have been set up, and I hope they will be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing, however, is political stability, because only if that exists will companies move there. Under our new agreement, it will be possible for the European Union to provide them with the necessary support. I am sure that in conjunction with the Commission we will do everything to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is somewhat ironic, since today is 2 May and the Commission's agreement was signed on 24 November. It may be that, had we adopted it earlier, we would have been able to avoid some of the consequences as well. I will restrict myself to pointing out that, this afternoon, the guerrillas have fired on the Albanian Embassy, shops and flats belonging to Albanians have been destroyed in Bitola, which had never known any disorder before, and yesterday a bomb was defused at Skopje airport. I therefore call upon you, ladies and gentlemen to do whatever you can to stop this escalation of violence while it is still possible, while there is still a chance of success and you still have the strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Macedonia has been a nightmare for the West for years. The Council and Commission resolutions mention Macedonia chiefly in relation to Albania, but then there is Kosovo to be taken into consideration. And there is clearly more than that: Macedonia appears to be the centre of the mess in the Balkans. It is a nation with an irrational streak, with some citizens who are pro-Bulgarian, others who are pro-Serbian, with a large section that identifies itself with the Republic of Macedonia established by Tito, and with a large Albanian minority. Well then, it cannot do without dialogue or the country will fall to pieces. Today, Europe is doing something more to help: the greater the European interest in Macedonia, the greater the stability of Europe. However, you must do your part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, the European Union must therefore provide itself with the economic, political and institutional resources necessary to implement a strategy that would allow us to include these peoples and nations, if they so wish. We believe that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia plays a part, albeit a modest one, in achieving this. It was signed on 9 April 2001 and was ratified by Parliament just three weeks later, and in my view, this agreement represents a step forward for Macedonia, the region and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a step forward for Macedonia, since, in addition to the considerable funding provided by financial aid worth EUR 62 million since the beginning of this year and the opportunity to export its products to the fifteen countries of the EU, free from customs duties, the political significance of this agreement is a decisive factor. It symbolises a commitment given by the major Macedonian political forces, both Slav- and Albanian-speaking, to encourage political dialogue, without any acts of violence being committed between the various ethnic communities. This agreement encourages taking steps towards establishing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens and opens up the prospect of unification for a society that is threatened by instability, signs of which can be seen on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a step forward for the region, which we should no longer call ‘the Balkans’, since this is a term widely rejected for its painful connotations. For the region, the fact that Macedonia was the first country to sign this type of agreement is an incentive to take inspiration from this model of inter-ethnic cooperation, which is imperfect, but nevertheless groundbreaking. We should remember that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Labour and Social Policy, the Minister for Local Self-Government and many deputy ministers in Macedonia are Albanian.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is a step forward for the European Union itself, which has experienced so much difficulty in making a success of its common foreign policy, and the fact that the EU is able to play a truly constructive role in this important country should be seen as an encouraging sign.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we must continue to make good progress. Other similar agreements must be signed in the same spirit with Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and the next step should be to accept their candidature for joining the European Union. Even if each country understands that the path leading from their application to actually joining is part of a process, the conditions for an active partnership already exist. My group, in any case, has decided to make a determined effort to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The agreement which we are discussing today, which was signed by the contracting parties six months ago, covers the inclusion of protocols establishing political dialogue with FYROM, contains measures for closer regional cooperation, opens the way for the establishment of a free trade area with the European Union and lays down measures for the free movement of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services and the movement of capital. It also gives a commitment to harmonising the legislation of that country with that of the EU, particularly in certain fundamental areas of the internal market, and, lastly, it also promotes measures on cooperation in a wide range of fields, particularly justice and home affairs. This, Mr President, is the agreement that has been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the agreement has been concluded, we hope that its clauses will represent a great step towards peace and stability in the region, whose peoples have already demonstrated that their aspirations to become part of our area of freedom and development are legitimate. This is also why the agreement can and must set an example for the other countries in the Balkans. With the recent acts of aggression that have been committed at the border and perpetrated against that country’s civilian population and armed forces, the important thing now is to support the efforts of the Macedonian government and people to maintain the stability of the country and to encourage the government and the moderate Albanian parties to avoid destructive and confrontational positions. Their action must focus on maintaining peace and democracy in a multi-ethnic society, which is, incidentally, a crucial factor for the implementation of this agreement. We must therefore encourage the Macedonian government to pursue its policy in order to guarantee fundamental rights and tolerance between all ethnic groups so that impetus can be given to the country’s economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I think that the agreement must enter into force as quickly as possible and I hope that with Parliament’s vote, our message to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be understood, so that the violence can be dealt with effectively and that this example is followed by the neighbouring peoples and countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Italy, we are witnessing a squabble between the 'Pole' and the 'Olive Tree' over non-existent issues, over questions of deference of one or the other to the Vatican, and squabbles over serious matters as well, such as that of the conflict of interests concerning the centre-right candidate, an extremely serious matter yet one which has not been tackled by the centre-left in the five years of the legislature which is coming to an end.</p>

You may have a different view of democracy, but everyone can say what they feel needs to be said.</p>
<p class="contents">I was just getting to the point, Mr President. Thanks to Mr Swoboda and his initiative and the cooperation of some of the Members, we have, at last, recouped the time lost, and I am extremely grateful to Mr Swoboda for that. At last, we have an agreement. We are all aware – every now and again I agree with Mr Wurtz – that what is needed is to start to think about the real issue, which is that of accession, for we cannot continue to have different categories for candidate countries and countries which cannot be candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of Macedonia, a few weeks ago, when the High Representative, Mr Solana, returned, I think we all had some hope of seeing an improvement in the situation. The recent events mentioned by Mr Volcic are, however, evidence that the situation is anything but under control: indeed, what has happened – the fact that eight soldiers were killed a few days ago and the anti-Albanian demonstrations – shows that this is not the case. In my opinion, the situation is extremely serious; it is true that we were a minority to say so months and months ago, but I feel that the situation is extremely serious. Certainly, Parliament can no longer see this agreement as the solution to the crises in Macedonia. A great deal more will be needed, and here I am addressing our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia: the conditions have to be restored for genuine dialogue, there must be proper non-manipulative analysis of the real issues concerning, in particular, the Albanian minority, the cumulative frustrations suffered by this minority but also by other Albanian communities. I would point out that, until the Kosovo issue is resolved, it will be difficult to find a solution to the problem of Macedonia. Therefore, we must persuade the Commission and the Council to tackle these issues comprehensively at last and to discuss, at last, the matter of Kosovo's final status, to resolve, at last, the issue of Kosovar prisoners, and then to help our Macedonian friends deal with their genuine problems.</p>
<p class="contents">These frustrations are far-reaching. Macedonia's current economic situation certainly does nothing to further the resolution of any of these issues, but there is no doubt that there are currently economic and other disparities between the treatment of the Albanian minority and that of the Macedonian majority. When the Albanian minority of a town such as that of Tetovo sees coach loads of workers, 'ethnic Macedonian' workers, arriving from Skopje, the only possible conclusion is that they are being treated differently.</p>
<p class="contents">So federalism cannot provide a solution? In my opinion, Mrs Pack, quite the contrary: we must consider federalism. Federalism does not necessarily bring division. There are federalistic solutions – and I refer to the case of Belgium, for example, which invented the concept of community federalism, in which, for matters more directly related to the relationship between the citizens and their institution, which may include culture, education and even health, it would be possible to conceive of a federalism which would not bring about territorial division in Macedonia but which would provide the substantial<span class="bold"> </span>Albanian minority with institutions to represent it too and, therefore, with autonomous control at least over the areas which concern it most directly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia should be able to view these proposals for a solution without fear or suspicion, for they are the channels through which a climate can be established in which the two great communities that make up Macedonia today can coexist peacefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ethnic disturbances in the city of Bitola are further proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, this violent clash between Albanian guerrilla fighters and a Macedonian elite patrol raises fresh questions concerning the effectiveness of the international military presence on both sides of the Kosovar-Macedonian border. First of all, where were the KFOR units at the time of Saturday’s confrontation, which was very intense indeed. I would appreciate it if both the Council and Commission could shed some light on this. In the final analysis, rapporteur Swoboda has not for nothing highlighted the KFOR’s essential contribution to the pacification in the border region between Kosovo and Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a second question for the Council and Commission: there is an apparent lack of communication between KFOR contingents which are based on Kosovar and Macedonian border territory. I am not expecting a direct reply, but I do hope that both European institutions will address this elementary pacification condition with the seriousness it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is recommended, in sound consultation and close cooperation with the Macedonian and Serbian authorities, for the KFOR to deploy extremely tight border control with neighbouring Kosovo. It is precisely this assistance, as rapporteur Swoboda pointed out with good reason, which benefits the stabilisation and association process in the entire region of the western Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He spoke those words with the backing of the entire Parliament because, of course, we remember the time before the Yugoslav wars, when Macedonia, in particular, played an extremely intelligent and constructive role by drafting compromises to make the warring parties change course. That is something which we will not forget in a hurry.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we remember the reception in Macedonia of refugees from Kosovo: that too was an enormous effort which caused the necessary tension within Macedonia. It was not an easy task and we will not forget this.</p>
<p class="contents">The western world, and the European Union too, on the other hand, have not always behaved impeccably towards Macedonia. A boycott was introduced, the effects of which Macedonia had to shoulder. Macedonia was fobbed off with humanitarian aid and was not really given any opportunities for its own industry. It is extremely important for the European Union to take an emphatic and positive step forward now with this Stabilisation and Association Agreement, by means of which fresh opportunities will be created for Macedonian industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we were also critical of Macedonia, and still are, because it was slow in establishing interethnic relations. But all hell is breaking loose precisely at a time when the University of Tetovo is turning over a new leaf by offering opportunities to Albanian-speaking groupings in Macedonia, as a result of which the official apparatus will probably be less one-sided. It is extremely unfortunate that the Copenhagen criteria, which apply across the board to all candidate countries, are at now risk there. I would therefore call on the Macedonian politicians to make a special effort to act as advocates for the constitutional state, because in this way they will be welcome to join the union of constitutional states of which we are all part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An agreement will enable us to set up intensive relations in a very concrete manner. An agreement is an important instrument for the region’s further stabilisation and adds, as such, to the Stability Pact in a meaningful way.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is more. A Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step towards EU membership. It is the culmination of the pledge which the European Union undertook, namely that a successful implementation of all elements of the Stability Pact will open up the way to membership of the EU. It underlines the focus on Europe and on European values.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Macedonian model will be copied promptly by the others. There are already negotiations under way with Croatia. With regard to Albania, preparations to that effect are being made. Hopefully, initial talks will soon be held in Belgrade too, provided that the Montenegro issue does not put a spanner in the works. And we should not overlook Bosnia, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of this agreement lies not only in the provisions it contains, which enables cooperation in many areas. The close ties with the European Union which are based on this agreement, as well as the prospect of membership tied in with that, could have a moderating effect on the internal relations in these countries. That is a form of conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">We have actually noticed these effects in the candidate countries. The active role which the High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have managed to play during the recent disturbances in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a shining example of this positive effect. The only conclusion we could draw therefore is that more of these agreements are needed in the region in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, following the fall of the Milosevic regime on 1 October 2000 and the ensuing democratic changes which took place in Belgrade, the European Union has radically changed its policy towards Serbia. In the Union's message to the Serbian people last September the foreign minister said that the Union promised that a vote for democracy in Serbia would be a vote for Serbia in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After the democratic transition in Serbia, the Union lifted its sanctions to repeal the oil embargo against Serbia and the Union lifted flight bans. The Union has also extended funding via the European Reconstruction Agency in Serbia to Montenegro as well as to propose an extension to the recently announced trade preferences of the Balkans and the whole of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations. The European Union is right to be active in contributing to the institutional and economic rebuilding that is presently taking place within the former Republic of Yugoslavia. We must all work together to put behind us the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans since the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrest of Mr Milosevic is the first important step in bringing him to justice and the authorities in Belgrade must be congratulated for their determination in this regard. It is only right and proper that he answers to the Serbian people for crimes he has committed against them and in their name.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have before us the best prospects for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe and the European Union is prepared to play an active role in this regard. The overall financial assistance from the Union to the states which comprise the former Republic of Yugoslavia now amounts to EUR 475 million. This assistance includes help for educational programmes, reconciliation schemes, the provision of shelters for refugees, constructing border crossing-points as well as supporting infrastructure projects such as the building of roads and the clearing of the Danube river of pollutants.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is important that Kosovo leaders speak out clearly against the violence that is taking place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. These leaders should remember that it is very hard to justify to European taxpayers the very substantial levels of financial assistance Kosovo is receiving from the Union if its leaders fail to condemn the violence which is taking place in the region at this time. The violence, murder, human suffering and instability in the Balkan regions, which have been taking place over the last 10 years, must now be put behind us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure that our colleagues expect a Greek MEP to say something about the dispute over the name. Perhaps this dispute should never have arisen, perhaps it should have been settled a long time ago; in any event, negotiations are under way, friendly negotiations, and I trust that this problem will soon be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, Greece wholeheartedly supports its neighbouring state. Everything we have heard here about what the European Union should be doing, in the form of action rather than high-flying words, Greece is already doing. In other words, Greece is already providing economic support in the form of investments – it is one of the biggest, if not the biggest investor in our neighbouring country – and through trade. It is providing political support by steadfastly backing the policy of reconciliation being applied by the government in our neighbouring country to the extremely difficult, the terribly difficult internal problems which it faces and it is providing international support in that it has officially called on NATO to prevent the anarchy which other areas in the region are endeavouring to import via our neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be lulled by the calm here in Parliament into underestimating just how terrible the problems being created are. Extremists are using age-old, familiar tactics to kill, plunder and create incidents in order to set two groups in the same country – and in the final analysis from the same nation, because they are Europeans just like us – at each others’ throats. It is a familiar tactic. Unfortunately, it has proven effective and we must oppose it. Unfortunately we, the European Union, have added grist to the mill of mutual destruction with our mistakes. We must stand firm in our opposition and prove that we can bring about reconciliation and facilitate collaboration between nations; this is the only way of forging a link in the chain of peace rather than creating a hotbed of discontent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economic concessions and promises of accession to the European Union, naturally once it has complied fully with social demands, are a means of ensuring greater penetration of European capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, which cites the decisions taken at Stockholm, basically agrees to treat Albanian extremists posing as negotiators who, as we have seen, have not let up in their criminal activities, and the government of the FYROM on an equal footing. Everyone knows that the famous National Liberation Army, which aspires to be the official negotiator of the Albanian minority, is in fact an offshoot of the KLA. Having set the wolf to guard the lambs, it is up to the High Representative to monitor compliance with the agreement. That is why, in our view, this policy, as set out in the present report, merely adds fuel to the fire raging in the Balkans and offers encouragement to the grand unification plans of the Albanian nationalists.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to safeguard the right of the people in the area to decide their own future and, if we want to help, it is precisely this sort of intervention and activity which we should refuse to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Before I turn to the question of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, let me place on record our condemnation of the attack on the Kosovo foreign border at the weekend in which eight Fyrom soldiers were killed. As Commission Patten said at the weekend, this was an attack against democracy, an attack designed to derail the interparty dialogue that has recently begun in Fyrom on interethnic relations, a dialogue which the European Union has strongly supported.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to stand four square for the values of tolerance and moderation and in support of those who seek to resolve differences through dialogue instead of the bomb and the bullet. That is why the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Fyrom which took place in Luxembourg on 9 April was such an important event. It is the first such agreement we have signed with a country in the region and it symbolises the strong ties that exist between the Union and Fyrom. It was signed in the presence of the European Union's Foreign Ministers and representatives of nearly all the parties: opposition government, Albanian, Macedonian, Slav, which are represented in the Parliament in Skopje.</p>
<p class="contents">The message was one of unity, unity in the face of the threats to democracy that Fyrom has recently faced and continues to face today. Unity in a shared belief in Fyrom's future as a key member of the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations were launched by the Commission on 5 March 2000. Thanks to excellent cooperation with the Macedonian authorities, the negotiations were concluded within nine months and the agreement was initialled in the margins of the Zagreb Summit on 24 November.</p>
<p class="contents">The main elements of the agreement are the establishment of a free trade area between the Community and Fyrom within a ten-year period after the entry into force of the agreement, the establishment of a political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation provisions on the freedom of movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, a commitment by the Fyrom authorities to approximate legislation to that of the European Community especially in the internal market, cooperation in areas such as justice and home affairs, establishment of a stabilisation and association council that supervises the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement makes clear that Fyrom is a potential candidate for membership of the European Union once it has implemented the agreement and subject to the Copenhagen criteria. The interim agreement also signed on 9 April provides for the trade-related provisions of the agreement to enter into force from 1 June 2001, without having to wait for the formal ratification of the agreement by national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission invites the European Parliament to give its assent to the agreement and we hope that national parliaments will ratify the agreement as quickly as possible. As honourable Members are aware, this is a critical period in Fyrom's history. This agreement and Parliament's support for it underline the European Union's commitment to Fyrom's wellbeing and the confidence in our people. That is the context in which the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative have been working hard in recent weeks to facilitate the dialogue between democratically elected political parties in Fyrom, initiated by President Trajkovski and which is designed to address legitimate grievances.</p>
<p class="contents">That hard work will continue, but as with the agreement, while the European Union will wish to be as supportive as possible, ultimately the main effort must be made by the people of Fyrom and their political leaders. It is they who carry responsibility for their countries future which is why it is so important to press ahead now with the political dialogue.</p>
