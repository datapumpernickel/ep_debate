For example, it covers topics such as the situation of fundamental human rights in the Communist dictatorship which China still is, the brutal cultural genocide in Tibet and the instances of torture and death penalties on a large scale, also directed against political dissidents. Surely there is no comparison with the situation in the United States of America which, nevertheless, was likened to that in China by another speaker this morning. One thinks of the brutal threats to independent Taiwan and the total lack of freedom of expression. The list goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">When a list of this kind is included in this report, we should, in fact, also dare ask ourselves what the concrete or tangible result is of so many years of international and intense dialogue regarding human rights in the Communist dictatorship of China. What improvements have actually been made in that region over the past few years? Unfortunately, this is a rhetorical question. It remains, therefore, unacceptable in my view that this dictatorship can count on so much tolerance and so much cooperation from the EU, but also from more or less the entire international community, even with regard to the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2008. For example, I remember a few years ago that South Africa had to settle for far less understanding. The protest is only verbal and is never backed up by any action. I notice that when, in recent times, governments in Austria and Italy which were not to the liking of certain European opinion formers in, for example, my country took up office in entirely democratic ways, a number of boycott campaigns were actually launched. The self-same conscience of the world falls silent, however, or only deals in words when China is involved, which is something I regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Graça Moura's report. While I am not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am one of the vice-chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the Peoples' Republic of China and so take a considerable interest in what is happening there. From my perspective, the most significant development in China of recent years is the move towards China becoming incorporated into the world trading system. Not merely is this significant, as it takes China into the world community of nations, it also brings China into the evolving new system of decision-making in an increasingly interdependent world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two particular points which arise from this. First, for Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation to be a success, it is necessary for legal certainty and even-handedness to apply to commercial relations between Chinese business and firms from outside. If and when these relationships go wrong, and it is bound to happen from time to time, there is an overriding requirement for there to be in place proper legal processes to deal even-handedly and fairly with outstanding causes of disagreement. I know that steps are being taken to enable this to occur and I very much support and welcome them because without them WTO membership cannot be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is a characteristic of current developments in international relations that the traditional demarcation between domestic and foreign policy is breaking down. Regardless of whether human rights issues in the past may have been treated as purely domestic considerations, increasingly now they are not. Regardless of the situation in classical international law, these things are important to people outside China. They will and do take them into account in making policy, be it political or commercial.</p>
<p class="contents">The same equally applies within the European Union. How these aspects of life are handled domestically in China now has, and will continue in the future to have, repercussions on the way in which relations between China and both foreign countries and foreign businesses develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carrilho (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, we cannot overemphasise the importance of EU-China relations, which have developed significantly in recent years, as we all know, specifically in the areas of political dialogue, trade relations, and scientific and technological cooperation. We must now step up these relations and extend them to other areas in a way that suits both parties. The Commission communication, which warrants the support of Parliament, presents a strategic framework for such a process and proposes elements for practical action. Along these lines, we also hope that account will be taken of the ideas put forward in the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Vasco Graça Moura.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the limited time available to me, I shall emphasise only three aspects: in addition to cooperation in the fields of trade, industry and technology, made possible by China’s recent accession to the WTO, cultural dialogue between Europe and China must be stimulated. For example, the development of exchanges at university level is something we can easily achieve, specifically by extending the scope of the TEMPUS programme. Secondly, I wish to state that Macao and Hong Kong, in addition to being particularly important points of international contact in the economic and financial spheres, could also become centres of intense cultural exchange. The success of these two autonomous regions will benefit China, but would also be important for Europe. Apart from anything else, it could provide a good example of what can be achieved when international relations are geared towards peaceful interaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the issue of human rights is still a matter of huge concern if we wish to deepen cooperation with China. As the rapporteur states, we hope to see some more positive and more significant indications by China so that, by the time the 2008 Olympic Games are held, China’s image on the international scene will be an entirely positive one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU can help a country such as China, with a population of 1 250 million and the world's seventh largest GDP, find its niche in the international community in terms of political, economic, social and cultural relations. China's accession to the World Trade Organisation last November in Doha is of crucial importance. It is now impossible for China to pursue political goals with economic sanctions, as it did before. Accordingly, economic sanctions, such as those directed against the Netherlands as President of the EU in 1997 because it drafted a UN resolution about the human rights situation in China, are now a thing of the past. China will need to observe the letter and spirit of the regulations of the World Trade Organisation. As chairman of the Interparliamentary Delegation for relations with the People’s Republic of China, I should like to underline that the European Parliament can play quite a substantial role. In addition to the various summit meetings at government and official level, an open and transparent political dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People's Congress can help further develop democracy and respect for human rights in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation in China has greatly deteriorated in the past year. The increasing number of political executions spring to mind, as well as the ban on the Falun Gong movement and the recent escape of the Tibetan Karmapa Lama to India. China must unconditionally observe the UN Treaty concerning civil and political rights which, after all, it signed itself. Actual steps must be taken in order to ensure that this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will continue to insist on democratisation and the observance of human rights in China and will also continue to devote attention to the problems involving Taiwan and Tibet. A remarkable result was achieved two weeks ago during our dialogue with a delegation from the parliament of the Tibetan Autonomic Region in Brussels. A pledge was made on this occasion that the Red Cross will be allowed to visit prisons and work camps in Tibet. We welcome this with open arms and hope that this will actually be done. In June, the China delegation will be visiting China and Tibet. In this way, the European Parliament will be able to do its bit towards further strengthening relations with China, for we can learn a great deal from each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have known Tibet for over twenty years, even its furthest-flung corners, and it must be borne in mind that Tibet is the largest highland area in the world, about as large as the whole of Europe between Gibraltar and the Urals. Tibet possessed, and to some extent still does possess, an independent culture, religion and way of life, and it is now high time for the Council to appoint an EU Special Representative and for Tibet as a whole to achieve an agreed autonomy. For not all is yet lost while the old culture still lives on the fringes of present-day Tibet, in Kham and Amdo, which are today no longer considered part of the autonomous province of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of negotiations between the central government and Beijing and within the government-in-exile in Dharamsala must be encouraged. Nobody wants the old monastic state back, but Tibet can defend its culture as an autonomous region in China if human rights are guaranteed within it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close with something that is very close to my heart. Tibetans, both those in exile and those in Tibet, who have for 50 years used peaceful means to press for their rights, never resorting to terrorist actions of any kind, should not, in times like our own in which globalised terrorism predominates, be branded as terrorists, but are owed a tribute of respect for their peaceful approach.</p>

He has raised a number of issues which merit further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with his observation that while the human rights dialogue could indeed be useful, unfortunately up to now it has not produced tangible results. Human rights continue to be abused, political activity is suppressed and, according to Amnesty International, there were more State executions in China last year than in all other countries combined.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Taiwan, I also condemn President Jiang Zemin's threats to use military force. Only peaceful negotiations carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect will bring about progress. Furthermore, the cowardice of EU Member States in refusing a visa to President Chen Shui-bian to visit Europe is self-serving and counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to other matters, the EU needs to review how the 1989 arms embargo is being implemented, especially since Member States are being allowed to interpret the rules themselves. In Ireland, for example, military goods can be exported to China, as long as they are not sold directly to the military. There are no end-user checks in place to ensure that they do not end up in the hands of the military or security services for purposes of which the EU would strongly disapprove. The UK continues to have a flourishing trade in British-made military goods.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for Hong Kong, there are a number of issues about which I have concerns but I feel it is inappropriate to raise those concerns now. I hope that in the very near future – possibly in the autumn – the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will take an initiative and we will have a much more comprehensive report to deal with the many concerns which this House and indeed I myself, as rapporteur, have relating to Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There have been huge changes in China over the last decade. Ten years ago, we witnessed the dramatic events in Tiannamen Square; today we are witnessing a solution – of sorts – to the problem of both Macao and Hong Kong, improvements in Taiwan, involvement in the World Trade Organisation and, after Greece, the next Olympic Games in 2008, which all goes to show that progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Does that mean that it is all good news? By no means. China is not doing at all well when it comes to human rights. And it is not doing well it comes to human liberties. However, when you evaluate questions of political strategy, you have to decide on a cut-off point. And our cut-off point has to be a democratic China, a pole of stability in a multipolar, peaceful world. And that is what our political strategy should be geared towards. Accusations and one-sided relations do not bring about policies, which is precisely why the whole point of political strategy is to look to the future and not get bogged down in day-to-day issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Moderation, stable objectives and efficiency are the common ground for joint action in such cases. China has worked with us in the fight against terrorism and that is a peak on its development curve. Our relations are improving constantly and, more to the point, I hope that we shall have more improvements in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone meeting Chinese delegates nowadays will find a new generation of people, very young people, 30, 40, 50 at most, with a good level of education and a good grounding in world affairs and that is most encouraging. China itself has found a formula for progress, calling the change ‘market Communism’ and shying away from the term ‘market policy’ in both economic and social relations. That is how it is developing and I think that we should help it by persuading it to correct its bad points. And there are a lot of them! Nevertheless, we must not be subversive in our persuasion.</p>
<p class="contents">I think China is on the right path because, for better or for worse, it is one of the lucky countries, a lucky nation with a long history of culture and civilisation and the heritage to match. And in the changes being made to the ideological and political values which every society craves for the sake of its own cohesion, China's history and culture carry great weight and, as far as I know, it is precisely these cultural elements which derive from Confucius, from humanitarian values and so on, which efforts are being made to restore as social values in China, which is a good thing because they will help bring about a balanced and humanitarian society.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, I trust that when we come to vote on Mr Graça Moura's report tomorrow, subject to a few improvements, we shall set the European Union's strategy towards China on the right political course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on a very sound report. It is a really good piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">China is a huge country of growing importance in the world. The consequences of the economic, social and political transformations faced by the country are unforeseeable. In connection with China’s membership of the WTO – supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party – there will be many opportunities for the EU and China to deepen their cooperation. Economically, socially, culturally and politically, we must have an extensive dialogue with China. WTO membership will make demands when it comes to software piracy, environmental issues, trade unions etc, and we can perhaps be of help.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be no surprise to you, Mr President, that the ELDR Group is very concerned about the issue of human rights. We genuinely want to appeal to the Commission to increase the pressure on China where these issues are concerned. Commentators throughout the world are agreed that the human rights situation is deteriorating overall. It seems as if China, just like Russia in the case of Chechnya, is using the fight against terrorism as an alibi in order to commit atrocities against minorities. The ability to practise one’s religion freely in China is strictly limited. Catholics report systematic persecution, and mosques are burned down. In Tibet, there is severe oppression of the Tibetan people, especially of monks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also anxious about the torture and persecution of democracy campaigners, trade union activists and dissidents, and the attempt to limit freedom of expression on the Internet is of course unacceptable. The daily arrests, torturing and systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners is also very worrying. Even though the Chinese regime appears resolved to break this movement, it will not succeed, and a dialogue must therefore be brought about on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">China also executes more people than all other countries put together and, in this area, we must exert pressure in order to bring about a moratorium. These issues must be given the highest priority in our cooperative relations with China. We had hoped that there might not perhaps have been any 2008 Olympic Games in China but, now that these are in fact to take place, we must use them as a means of exerting pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stood on this platform many times and talked about human rights in China, and many telephone calls have been received from the Chinese Embassy. That will continue. As long as there are Liberals in this House, we shall stand up for human rights in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China has decided to join the World Trade Organisation. This means that China has made a conscious choice in favour of openness, and this will not only be in the area of trade. China will, as a result, go through major changes that will have a huge impact on society. We will conduct that dialogue with that enormous country and we will need to build that dialogue not only on economic interests, but we will, through our electorate, through our values, through our institutions, founded on democracy and human rights, be forced to put this dialogue on an ethical footing, and it is useful to spell this out to the Chinese authorities from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard about the large-scale repression of Catholics and Muslims earlier on. Without being familiar with any of the intricacies myself, I should like to warn against the large-scale repression of those who practise Falun Gong. They are a peace-loving people who are thrown into prison in their thousands. We have received blood-curdling accounts and testimonies on this score. Human rights and international law are at the moment clearly the weak point; democracy will gradually take root in Chinese society and find its own way. And the Chinese Government should not react to this with large-scale repression.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention the increasing concern we have in this Parliament for Tibet and for other regions in that giant country which are asking for a certain level of autonomy and which want to be able to go their own way, culturally speaking. To respond to this simply with repression is criminal and, in my view, all those who in the near future have contact with the Chinese authorities should make it clear to them that we and our communities are not only concerned about money matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it was a good thing that the People's Republic of China joined the WTO. It was not a straightforward thing for the Chinese to do, as it will mean major processes of internal restructuring for them, but I consider it urgently necessary from the point of view of China's interests that these processes of restructuring should start now. I also believe that it represents a good starting point for an improvement in trading relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, though, to appeal to the Commission to keep a careful eye on how China meets the obligations it has entered into by joining the WTO. The behaviour of China, which had made promises, for example to open up the insurance market, has not been very encouraging in recent years. Promises were made, but attempts were made to evade them. In this respect, I hope that China will give real and positive acknowledgement of what the consequences must be – and it would be interesting if the Commissioner were to make a statement on the line the Commission will take on this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards political dialogue, my fellow Members have all made reference to the human rights issue. These human rights apply universally; they are not European human rights that we want to enforce on China, but universally recognised human rights that we demand, and they include the rights of minorities, be they religious or cultural. My fellow Members have already had something to say about Tibet. I would like to take up another example, the persecution of the unofficial Catholic Church in China, which has to exist underground because the government does not recognise the Catholic Church which sees itself as linked to the Vatican. That is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Taiwan, I hope that the People's Republic of China will open political dialogue without setting prior conditions. It is only political dialogue of this kind that can lead to reunification, and then only if this is on the basis of human rights and of democracy in a constitutional state. We in Parliament should play our part in promoting<span class="italic"> </span>contact between the two states. We should likewise maintain contacts with members of the parliaments in the People's Republic of China and in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that the Commission will soon set up its office in Taipei, so that the Commission, too, may support dialogue between the two states by means of its missions in Beijing and in Taipei. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the chairperson of the China delegation, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, has made some very valid points on this score. Nevertheless, we must be careful in our relations with China not to avoid the truth. The previous speaker has already alluded to this, as others have too. If the Chinese emperor is not wearing any clothes, then we should tell him. This would not be the first time. In common with some fellow MEPs, I am thinking, for example, of the situation with regard to Taiwan and the way in which we, and particularly our Foreign Affairs Ministers, deal with this situation as the European Union, for it is really hypocritical the way we go about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Take Taiwan's observer status in international organisations, say the World Health Organisation, which is now being discussed. This situation is ridiculous. As a democratic country, Taiwan should be able to take part in such organisations. Surely Taiwan is not the PLO from the sixties and the seventies. It is a country with which we have good relations, at a political level too, and which has experienced a tremendous, democratic development, yet it is being treated like a pariah. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that an elected leader such as Chen Shin-lian was unable to receive his freedom prize here? His wife was here, which was a feat in itself, but the man around whom everything revolved was absent. This, while the Chinese leader is currently on a glorious tour of the European Union. I welcome the fact that he is on this tour. This enables us to talk to him about what is happening, including the positive developments in China, but it remains a hypocritical situation. For let us be clear about this: China does not meet one single democratic criterion. Hong Kong is the most telling example where, recently, so-called ‘elections’, conducted in an entirely undemocratic way, were held for a new chief executive. If that is the shape of things to come in Taiwan, should it form part of China again, then it is not very inspiring.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, of course, also mention the human rights situation over there, and in particular mention should be made of capital punishment. Needless to say, it is absolutely impossible for us, as the European Parliament, to condone capital punishment but, unfortunately, China beats everyone hands down when it comes to executions. Between April and July 2001, more than 1 700 people were executed, which is more than the combined total in the rest of the world during the previous three years. The torture and abuse of suspects are also common practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is useful to add these critical observations to this excellent report.</p>

I do not know why he is here; China would not appear to be part of his remit. In my opinion, Commissioner Nielson concerns himself too often with things which are none of his business – and I think he understands what I am trying to say – and so I do not know what he might have to contribute in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of this report, I want to say that, two hours ago, we adopted a document which is extremely critical of Israel and regarding which there were opposing positions in the House. I voted against this document and I saw that, when it wants to, Parliament is capable of raising its voice. Two hours later, Mr President, we are presented with a document on China, a country with 1.2 billion inhabitants which oppresses hundreds of millions of people, ethnic and cultural minorities and ordinary citizens who are advocates of freedom and democracy, yet Parliament is incapable of doing more than – in point 10 – timidly raising the issue of human rights, after making complimentary comments about China and its development, referring to trade with the European Union, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not support this. We radicals condemn this approach, we condemn these double standards of the European Parliament, which is ‘forceful’ or tries to be forceful with those who are in a position of weakness, as Israel is now, under attack from a ferocious terrorism which, again this morning – and nobody has mentioned the fact – caused at least eight deaths, the deaths of innocent people, of course, in an Israeli bus, and then, the same day, expresses its satisfaction with the dictatorial Chinese regime which is oppressing hundreds of millions of people, rewarding it with a blank cheque. We condemn this behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that Europe will only become great when it succeeds in adopting an unambiguous attitude towards human rights, the rights of individuals and the rights of minorities, and so we will not vote for a text which has been described as hypocritical, a view I share. There are parts of the text such as the section relating to Taiwan which we support, but we reject the overall line it takes. We feel that the message Parliament and the European Union send to that country should be very different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very happy to note that overall Parliament and the Commission have reached similar conclusions on EU-China relations over the past three years and how they should develop in future. Despite several differences on some important issues, the EU and China have reached, in the last few years, a wide understanding on areas where the development of their relations is mutually beneficial. This has been amply demonstrated by the successful annual summits in 2000 and 2001, and, most recently, by Mr Patten's official visit to China which I will report on in the following remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">He was extremely well received, as a representative of the EU, wherever he went and had intensive meetings with President Jiang Zemin, the Deputy Prime Minister, Qian Qichen, five senior ministers and other policy makers. All of his interlocutors spoke frankly and openly about EU-China relations. Some strong messages he received during the visit were: a recognition of the increasing role of the EU in the world, an appreciation for the recent, rapid progress in EU-China relations; and a genuine will and commitment to continue the development of EU-China relations and cooperation at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">During his visit, Mr Patten put across the messages that all EU Member States were committed to the EU's China policy, that not only had trade and investment cooperation been impressive, but also that very strong progress was being achieved in other bilateral and transnational areas of concern, for example immigration, the environment and science and technology. Dialogues on regional and international issues, such as the Korean peninsula, ASEM, Afghanistan, and international terrorism were proving to be increasingly beneficial to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the report, I note that it rightly picks out the importance of the events of 11 September and the launch of the fight against international terrorism, and China's entry into the WTO. These events will help define, to some extent, the parameters for EU-China relations in the international arena for the foreseeable future. More specifically, like Parliament, the Commission welcomes China's support in the international fight against terrorism and China’s undertaking to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The report congratulates China on its accession to the WTO and expresses support for China's continuing economic and social reforms. We agree with this. It took China 15 long years of arduous negotiations to join the WTO. China also came a long way in that period. From being a rather isolated, inward-looking, centrally planned economy with a slightly open door, it is about to remove – we hope – many of the remaining great barrier walls to free trade. It is therefore that it has joined the WTO, but we will now need to ensure that China fully adheres to its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the fact that WTO accession will accelerate reform, but are conscious that the required reforms will bring with them serious challenges because of unemployment, urban drift and so on. We will do all we can to help to assist China during this delicate transition.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation in China has, in some respects, improved in the last few years, notably in the field of social and economic rights. But we remain deeply concerned about the general human rights situation. We remain committed to the human rights dialogue. However, while we are conscious that the way ahead will be a long-term process, we nevertheless believe that improvements in political and civil rights are needed in China, also in the short-term. Chris Patten raised human rights issues in detail during his visit, particularly with Foreign Minister Tang.</p>
<p class="contents">The report draws the attention of the Chinese Government to the importance of respecting and protecting the religious and cultural heritage of Tibet, and the identity of the Tibetan people. Chairman Re Di, the leader of the delegation from the National People's Congress of the Tibetan Autonomous Region that visited Parliament last month – whom some of you met and also referred to today – gave assurances that the Chinese Government pays a lot of attention to the protection of minorities and to their religious freedoms. We attach great importance to these issues and were happy to note these assurances, but we will of course continue to be vigilant about Tibet and will continue to call for a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama. Mr Patten also discussed these issues with Foreign Minister Tang and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of our cooperation with China I will take the liberty of informing Mr Dell'Alba that we are cooperating at a level of about EUR 50 million annually. We started from a traditional situation where we were funding quite a wide range of different activities. We are now at a point that is quite important, having approved in the Commission on 1 March this year a country strategy paper which brings our cooperation with China into the same mainstream as our global development policy, and which, is the responsibility of the Commissioner responsible for development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The future priorities of our cooperation in China will be support for the social economic reform process, sustainable development and environment, and the promotion of good governance, human rights and the rule of law. We have singled out these issues from an analysis of what is needed in order to use our basic general principles of fighting poverty in a manner that fits China's situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the different aspects I have singled out here, there are several other issues to which we attach great importance, such as relations with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and international issues such as global warming and illegal migration that, unfortunately, I do not have sufficient time to comment on today.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I welcome the report's reconfirmation that the EU has a profound interest in a stable, prosperous and open China, which embraces democratic practices, free market principles, human rights and the rule of law, and that the EU must pursue policies which will help China further its endeavours in this direction. That is what we fully intend to do through our increased dialogues and cooperation across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to reiterate the observation that for China some of our desired goals will take longer to achieve than others. As ever, there is a Chinese proverb that neatly encapsulates this very point, which is: "You won't help shoots grow by pulling them up higher".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
