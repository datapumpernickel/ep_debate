But before I say anything about the reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel, I would like on behalf of the Commission to express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who have lost their lives and also to extend our sympathy to the Swiss authorities and the Swiss people. Even if the causes of the accident are not yet known, this event again raises in a most pressing and dramatic manner the question of the safety of long road tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">The reopening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel does not require Commission approval. This decision is the sole responsibility of the French and Italian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The imminent reopening of the tunnel has, however, revived a number of controversies. First and foremost is the question of the tunnel's possible closure to heavy goods vehicles, something that the people living in the Chamonix valley had been calling for long before the disastrous fire. However, the Commission takes the view that safety criteria alone should determine the reopening of the tunnel and the only condition should be that all the safety requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information available to the Commission, the tunnel has now been equipped with modern safety devices under French and Italian responsibility. An electronic control centre has been set up, the electrical installations completely renewed, the ventilation system modernised, ventilated refuges created every 300 metres and emergency stopping bays every 100 metres.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the training of operating personnel and emergency services has been greatly improved. As an additional safety measure, new rules have been introduced for the minimum distance to be observed between vehicles using the tunnel. Finally, the two original operating companies, ATMB in France and SITMB in Italy, have been replaced by a single administrative structure, an important step bearing in mind that, according to a number of technical reports produced after the fire, the large number of casualties was due, among other things, to poor coordination between the two operators.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has contributed EUR 22.5 million to the repair work, which cost around EUR 200 million. As a result of this disaster and the two subsequent fires in Austria – the fire in the Tauern Tunnel on 25 May 1999 caused by a pile up that claimed 12 lives and the fire in the Kaprun glacier railway on 11 November 2000 that cost 156 people their lives – the Commission decided that, together with experts, it should also examine how tunnel safety might best be optimised. Our conclusions form part of the White Paper on transport policy up until the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing that tunnels are important features of many cross-border transport links, the Commission is planning European rules. These are intended to create the necessary conditions for guaranteeing users of road and rail tunnels, especially tunnels forming part of trans-European networks, a high level of safety. The Commission will pass a proposal to this effect to the European Parliament and the Council early in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent accident once more underlines the fundamental importance of controlling transalpine traffic flows. The Commission considers it an absolute priority that the two rail links already mentioned in the 1996 guidelines for the trans-European transport network, namely the Lyons-Turin link and the section across the Brenner, should be developed and taken into service without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It has informed the competent ministers of this on many occasions, urging them to take the necessary measures to expedite these projects and in particular to give thought to how they will be funded, not excluding public-private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from creating new infrastructures to cope with the bulk of freight transit traffic in the region, the Commission will be formulating minimum requirements for safety in tunnels, as announced in its White Paper. In the White Paper, the Commission also proposes a new scheme for transport infrastructure charges to take greater account of the external costs of the various transport operators.</p>
<p class="contents">This new charging policy should make a major contribution to creating a balanced relationship between transport operators, especially in sensitive regions like the Alps, favouring the most environmentally friendly among them. As part of its strategy for sustainable mobility, the Commission will also be proposing revision of the Euro-toll disc directive to allow cross- financing for new railway infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission has also proposed signing the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Community, which will be a political signal for the creation of a balanced relationship between transport operators, even if the corresponding provisions may in some cases be handled with a degree of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the Commission intends to make European transport systems sustainable and to take into account medium and long-term environmental objectives when doing this. A Communication to be presented by the Commission next year, will discuss this in greater detail</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santini (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot begin a debate on this subject without remembering the ten latest victims claimed by the St Gotthard tunnel, and Mr Fischler was quite right to pay tribute to them, but we must also remember that, this very morning, yet another incident took place in the Petit St Bernard tunnel. It seems almost to be an unfortunate coincidence, placing a greater onus on us, now that we are preparing to debate the proposal and the timeliness of whether or not to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">As I shall say later, I have no doubts on the matter, but there are many considerations I must air before I make this statement. First of all, the St Gotthard accident is directly connected with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, where, as everyone will remember, 39 people lost their lives on 24 March 1999, but there is an even more direct link than just the similarity between the two accidents, which it is only right to recall. It is a link of cause and effect: it seems clear to everybody that the mass of traffic that the Mont Blanc has not been able to cater for during the two and a half years or so since it closed has inevitably shifted to other Alpine passes, starting with the St Gotthard itself, which in turn is now closed, and then the Brenner and the Tarvisio and the whole Alpine arc, which, in short, has absorbed the surplus traffic that used to go through the Mont Blanc tunnel before it was closed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, therefore, that the cause of the accident can be quite easily identified and predicted, given the situation. Alongside the negative effect of the accidents, however, there is, of course, another negative effect, which is the impact on the environment. Heavy vehicles, especially those crossing an Alpine pass, certainly have an environmental cost that nobody would want to pay. Quite rightly, therefore, people have started discussing the subject of the Mont Blanc tunnel, particularly in the last couple of days, and proposals have been made to try to prevent the tunnel from reopening and thus protect the land around it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I totally disagree with this proposal, although I understand the legitimate aspirations of those living in a particular area to protect their environment. This proposal, however, not only contravenes the Treaty – in that it would violate a fundamental principle, that of the free movement of goods, persons and so on – but I would say it is also an ethical violation. By closing the Mont Blanc tunnel or keeping it closed, one is in fact just shifting an ecological problem from one part of the Alps to another; we would just be shifting the problem from the Mont Blanc region to the Fréjus region, to Switzerland, and to the Brenner and Tarvisio routes, as I said before, which does not seem right to me. I ask those who advocate this solution: what kind of proposal is this? What has become of the spirit of Alpine solidarity? What has become of the feeling of belonging to the Community, to the European Union? On the other hand, as the Commissioner has also reminded us, the opening of the Mont Blanc tunnel will certainly be accompanied by special safety arrangements. It goes without saying that, in addition to the environmental damage, there is also the economic damage that we have a duty to consider here: during the two and a half years that it has been closed, it has been calculated that Italy alone has lost EUR 1 500 million, and the Val d’Aosta region will have seen its own regional gross domestic product fall by 10 %. France, too, has probably had losses comparable to these: perhaps Mrs Grossetête will tell us, as I know she is to speak afterwards and she lives in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be ashamed to talk about the economic aspect as well, since the Mont Blanc tunnel, like all passes through the Alps, responds to demands which are not solely economic but may be expressed in economic terms, and which need to be met to enable the various nations, citizens and groups operating in the fields of industry, trade and tourism to carry on their activities. All this serves not only the countries on either side of the border but also and especially more distant countries – I am thinking of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany – whose traffic inevitably has to cross the Alps, which are today almost closed off and practically impassable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the Italian and the French authorities have, at last, found a common language in which to propose solutions<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>and have invested almost EUR 300 million, the burden being shared equally by the two countries, to ensure safety. It is said that once this tunnel has been restored – which I hope will be very soon – it will be the safest in the world, with features that I will not repeat now because they have already been mentioned by the Commissioner himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we need to take one further step: to speed up the bureaucratic and technical process to complete the Munich-Verona link, which means the Brenner tunnel, and the Lyon-Turin link, which means the Fréjus tunnel. These are priority projects. I shall end, Mr President, by reminding the House that there is a new proposal that might help: the Aosta-Martigny rail link, which starts in Milan, is not one of the European priorities but could be included if France and Italy take the matter up. By the way, I shall close with some news: tomorrow the Italian Minister, Mr Lunardi, and his French counterpart, Mr Gayssot, will be meeting to agree on a date to reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, which I hope will be very, very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel is a European event, a happy European event, just as the accident in the St. Gotthard Tunnel is a tragic, sad European event. Transport knows no borders. It makes no difference whether you are a member of the European Union or not. We need transport that connects the regions of Europe, but we also need transport that respects the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commission’s approach is correct in seeing the question of tunnel safety in the overall context not only of transport policy but also of environmental policy. The Commissioner mentioned, for example, the transport protocol to the Alpine Convention. I just wonder – the Council is not here – where the ministers are who signed it because it is high time the governments took action here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commissioner spoke of a shift from road to rail, where that is possible and worthwhile. Here, too, a number of European governments – the Austrian government among them – have been slow in putting that into effect. The plans are good. But the financial resources must also be made available if the measures in question are to be taken. I also know that in many countries the railways have the capacity to carry more freight than they do at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper that was mentioned and which the Vice-President of the Commission has presented, is a very positive and important step in the restructuring of transport policy. Our Group strongly supports it and I hope that the announced presentation of the amendment to the Euro-toll disc directive and the infrastructure costs directive will not be delayed, and that we shall be able to discuss the Euro-toll disc revision very soon. Finally, there has been a lot of talk recently of a fast-track procedure. We have talked about it a great deal and very often, and this is a subject where we really could introduce a fast-track.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure it is right that it is not only a question of overriding transport policy but also of the level of safety. We welcome the Commission’s intention of prescribing safety standards here because if the tunnels we travel in are unsafe we are all affected. A number of things have been mentioned. I would like to add that the question of working hours is particularly important for lorry drivers, as is the matter of controls, because it does not matter how good the rules are that we adopt if these things are not enforced. This, too, is a matter for the individual countries to act on.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group and I are quite clear in our own minds that this is not about pitting one country against another. France, Italy, Germany, Austria and all the other countries of the EU have a right to the free movement of goods. But the people who live in the Alpine regions also have a right to a healthy environment. Some people may laugh or smile at the fact that the UN has designated next year the year of mountains. However, it really is high time special attention were paid to the environmental situation, in the Alps and the Pyrenees in particular. Now, Mr President and Mr Commissioner, I must ask to be excused. I am going to be rude and leave the room now because I am going to Romania on Parliament’s behalf. But we nevertheless endorse these principles of a really environmentally-friendly transport policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caveri (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted this debate is happening at last. As the Member for the Val d’Aosta, I have been calling for a moment’s reflection in this House for many months, because I believe these issues should be resolved through institutional channels, this is the true alternative to futile protests. It is sad that this should happen on the day after the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, which used to be referred to as one of the safest of tunnels, and, what is more, in Switzerland, which is the only European country – not yet part of the European Union – that has truly embarked on a policy of transferring freight from road to rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Mont Blanc has always been a symbol: it has been the symbol of mountaineering and also the symbol of road transport, with this tunnel built in the 1960s, which for many years was the most important tunnel in the Alps. Nobody could ever have imagined that we would see such intense growth in road transport, and I must say that 24 March 1999 was, for those who saw it, like me, a tragic day: the sight inside the tunnel was truly appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all these events should serve to make it clear that extreme positions on both sides are useless. The extremist approach adopted by those who say ‘stop the HGVs’ is unrealistic. It offloads HGVs onto someone else and proposes a utopian world without transport and without mobility; naturally, however, we must also say no to those who call for ‘unlimited transport for all: the economy needs it.’ I believe this is an unsustainable position for mountain peoples like those in the Val d’Aosta, whom I represent, just as a pretence at a setting a limit would also be unsustainable. In fact, we are asking for a daily ceiling on HGV numbers – a genuinely effective serious limit. On the eve of this meeting, Società Autostrade, the motorway operator, told us that, according to the tunnel calculations, traffic will be 30 per cent lower than before the tragedy. I do not know if this will suffice, but I must say that the right approach is in the White Paper, the Alpine Convention transport protocol and the Swiss model. Under the swiss model, it was decided to agree to HGVs if they pay a tax and to invest the revenue, together with other capital, in rail tunnels. We want rail tunnels: we want the Turin-Lyon tunnel; we also want the Aosta-Martigny tunnel, this rail project that may acquire vital, decisive importance. In the meantime, however, we want real, serious limits for the sake of safety and the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot limit ourselves to lamenting the victims. We must finally take action to definitively stop this flood of disasters and we have good reasons for demanding this in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">From the environmental point of view, reopening the Mont-Blanc tunnel goes against the commitments given by the European Union and its Member States on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. What is the point of our voting in favour of sustainable transport and switching from road to rail if, at the first opportunity to show determination to reverse the ‘everything by road’ trend, this option is removed?</p>
<p class="contents">In the two years of work on the tunnel, rail freight transport has not increased. It has remained static at 10.5 million tonnes per year, whereas additional rail capacity does exist and the 13.5 million tonnes that transit every year through the Mont-Blanc tunnel could have been absorbed by rail if capacity had been doubled for transit through Mont-Cenis, through the link that runs south of Lake Geneva and through the Dijon-Valorme link. It is incomprehensible that this rail solution should have been ignored, since it represents a transit capacity of up to 20 million tonnes per year via trans-Alpine routes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like the Commissioner to take note of this point, because I am giving him very practical proposals. It seems, however, that he is not interested. I would, therefore, like to say to him that we completely disagree with his analysis of the safety of the Mont-Blanc tunnel. This is another reason why we do not accept that it should be reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 200 million’s worth of work that has been undertaken, without an impact assessment or a public inquiry, does not meet the highest safety requirements. The tunnel is still a narrow (seven metres wide) single-direction tube that has no tarmac-covered and, therefore, fire-resistant surface, central escape hatch or parallel evacuation tunnel. The old ventilation duct will be used for evacuation.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety must be of primary importance for all forms of transport and not only, as you stated, for air transport. The Commission must, therefore, reject the reopening of the Mont-Blanc tunnel and accept the proposals that the Commissioner has ignored, but which are perfectly appropriate alternative proposals, which seek to use the railways for transit through the Alps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tunnel has the same specification as the tunnel rebuilt under Mont Blanc: substantially the same technical specification as regards safety, with the same carriageway width of about seven metres, or even worse, in that the Mont Blanc tunnel has no parallel service tunnel. Having heard the Commissioner, I have come to the following conclusion: more disasters will have to happen in order finally to persuade the European Commission to give up its policy of White Papers, which no longer apply, and the associated illusion that technology can solve any problem, and make it realise that a 40-tonne lorry in a seven-metre-wide tunnel is a lethal weapon.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we must ask the governments involved to delay the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel so that we can seriously reconsider what kinds of vehicles should be allowed to use it. We must say no to large HGVs; we should place a strict limit on the number of HGVs that can go through each day and we should ban dangerous loads. This is the only way we can prevent further disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I totally agree with Mr Santini when he says that closing a link such as a tunnel beneath the Alps causes real economic problems, and I fully understand this, but nor do I feel that we can call for it to be reopened unless all safety guarantees are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, even today we still do not know the real causes of the accidents that take place in these tunnels, any more than we know what guarantees we may be given that they will not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry first of all that the Council is not present to hear this debate, even though the Commissioner made it quite clear that this concerns a principle of subsidiarity. I am sorry that the Council is not here to say what it intends to do within the framework of a land-use planning policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are never given answers to our questions on the real trans-European networks, be they railways or roads.

We cannot keep on asking the same questions, when terrible accidents unfortunately occur, which are still unanswered two or three years later.</p>

<p class="contents">Road tunnel accidents have been on the increase in recent months, and this makes it particularly urgent for safety measures not to be delayed any further with White Papers and vague proposals. The reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, already well behind the schedule agreed on by the Italian and French Governments in January 2001, must take place within the framework of a number of conditions to ensure traffic safety and reduce environmental problems to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">In concrete terms, it is a matter of putting into operation traffic control mechanisms inside the tunnel, so that, with the application of new technologies and the constant presence of surveillance personnel, any accident will be picked up straight away. Traffic must also be regulated to prevent too many heavy goods vehicles being in the tunnel at the same time; such vehicles could be allowed through in only one direction at a time, for instance, and there could be tighter speed limits and other similar measures. A definitive list should be drawn up of goods banned from being transported through the tunnel, and, in this respect, let us remember that the St Gotthard incident would not have been so serious if one of the HGVs had not been carrying material as flammable as tyres. We should also adopt any other provisions that will help distribute commercial vehicle journeys evenly among the all-too-few road tunnels linking Italy to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only find a solution to the many problems posed by road tunnels if, of course, there is a definite shift of freight from road to rail, and it is in this direction that the Union should be directing its efforts. Such a shift, however, is a process that takes time, and so it seems rather unrealistic for those people, who are without doubt moved by the best environmentalist intentions – which we all share – to call today for the total closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel to commercial traffic. It should be noted that in Italy, at least, those same people are also protesting at the building of a new, faster high-speed railway line between Turin and Lyon, designed precisely to help distribute goods transport more evenly, which just shows how contradictory or even absurd such positions, held by certain Italian political groups, can be.</p>
<p class="contents">While, therefore, we share the environmental concern to protect the alpine environment of the Val d’Aosta, we must not fail to take into account the economic interests – including jobs – that the tunnel implies, particularly for the valley itself and also for Italy as a whole. These legitimate interests are in fact reflected in surveys carried out in the valley, according to which the great majority of the citizens want the tunnel to reopen.</p>
<p class="contents">What we ask is for the tunnel to be reopened with the safety measures mentioned above implemented, and, at the same time, for there to be a decisive international initiative to develop a new rail infrastructure, including, in particular, the new Turin-Lyon line, improved commercial traffic handling on the Turin-Bardonecchia-Amberieu line, and the widening of the Col di Tenda tunnel and the Aosta-Martigny tunnel. We call on the Italy-France intergovernmental commission, set up under the January 2001 declaration, to report to the European Parliament on all this as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Maurienne valley, the Fréjus tunnel, the valleys of Briançon, the Mont Genèvre pass and the Chamonix valley deserve a better fate than being merely HGV fodder', as the Savoy League put it. Alas, it seems that the road transport lobbies come before the health of the inhabitants, the safety of travellers or respect for sites of outstanding beauty.</p>
<p class="contents">What have the countries concerned done since March 1999 to replace road with rail? Not a thing. Between the first half of 2000 and the first half of 2001, rail freight between Italy and France fell by 8% and combined transport by 10%. In face of such lack of foresight, I can only support the request from the Savoy League for an independent international agency – which could be the Commission – to draw up a report on the Alpine passes between France and Italy and for, in the meantime, the Alpine tunnels to be reserved for tourist traffic and regional and inter-valley traffic, with strict limits on size and tonnage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, we had another tragedy, in the St Gotthard tunnel. This chapter of disasters is certainly not coincidental, it is the human price we pay for basing our goods transport system on HGV transport and pursuing the maximum profit, which creates terrible risks. Since the Mont Blanc tunnel was closed, the Maurienne valley has had to absorb the weight of all the traffic and is suffocating as a result. The St Gotthard tragedy will lead to even more re-routed traffic for the valley to absorb. Even in normal times there are not enough crossing points. So we need to tackle the problem of transit transport. We have to look for global solutions. In this context, reopening the Mont Blanc tunnel would mean ensuring that the correct distances between vehicles are observed, that road traffic is regulated, that partial traffic bans are observed, that ceilings on lorry numbers are imposed and observed, that the limits laid down for lorry-drivers' working hours are observed and that safety rules are continuously monitored. Finally, it would mean undertaking to develop 'piggybacking' and making immediate use of the existing transverse lines, which are under-used.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to review the entire policy of goods transport in Europe. The Union must finance adequate investment to that end. I think that in sensitive areas we should give up road goods transport, which means that, as of now, we have to mobilise the necessary resources for speeding up the development of piggybacking. The European Union must now show the political courage to make new and bold choices. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but I would like to ask a very open question. Which way will the traffic go if the Mont Blanc Tunnel, the St Gotthard Tunnel and the St Bernard Tunnel are closed? I am very much afraid – and that fear is shared by the population of Austria and the population all along the Alps – that the traffic will then go over the Brenner Pass and that we will have major problems in that highly sensitive region of the Alps, problems that will affect not only North and South Tyrol but also Trentino. I therefore implore you to be really forward looking in tackling this issue because it is not only a matter of road safety but of the environment in which many people live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say briefly, now that another accident has occurred in the St Gotthard tunnel, that I think there is a difference between learning lessons from that accident and exploiting its emotional charge for political ends. If we use the deaths in the St Gotthard tunnel, which, of course, we all deplore, as a pretext for saying that we must not reopen the Mont Blanc tunnel, then we should also close the Fréjus tunnel, the Arlberg tunnel and the Brenner Pass. In fact, we should close every Alpine tunnel that presents the same accident risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, that would totally paralyse southern Europe because, quite simply, we no longer have a choice today. As everybody here knows, the railways are not ready either institutionally, technically or economically to take over from the roads. Therefore, it seems to me that we have to take two kinds of measures, short term and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we must make the tunnels safer and take urgent measures, whether in Mont Blanc, where this has now been done, or in other tunnels, to regulate the traffic, ensure that no hazardous materials are carried through, strengthen the security, safety and intervention systems and speed up the adoption of a European directive on tunnel safety. This is much talked about but it has not yet materialised, so we must put it on the agenda very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">That aside, like everyone else here I believe that, in the long term, we should quite simply be able to ban, once and for all, heavy goods vehicles in tunnels because they are, in fact, the most dangerous vehicles, but that assumes that alternatives exist, and the Commission has, indeed, presented them in its White Paper. There are other projects too that need to be speeded up, including, in the case of the Alps, the two rail tunnels, the one between Lyon and Turin and the Brenner tunnel; there are similar projects in the Pyrenees, where the traffic situation is even more serious, although this is never mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must also assume our responsibility here and speak out. For my part, I feel we are still far from doing so. The Commission has produced an excellent White Paper; it is very good at laying down requirements, but it has not as yet paid out enough to enable us to make the transition to rail in the very short term. We therefore need to allocate far, far greater resources to improving rail capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying that public opinion is now concerning itself with transport policy – which is a good thing – and as a result, it is no longer a matter just for the specialists, for the large State bodies. It means we will all be judged by whether we can implement rapid solutions, not just the politicians but also the railwaymen and the hauliers. Let me conclude by saying that I also hope we will not confine ourselves to imposing constraints while rejecting all the solutions. In regard to north-south transport, I think we should also look again at adapting the Rhine-Rhone canal to heavy goods transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot say that we have to put a stop to road transport while, at the same time, rejecting transport by river and inland waterway which would relieve much of the pressure on the roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the quite specific question of signing the Alpine Convention, the Commission will endeavour to get the Council to sign during the course of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the primary concern is naturally for safety. I do not think it will work if we now quite simply push all safety matters up to the European level. Everyone must see to it in the areas for which he or she is responsible. The national authorities must do that just as much as we have to fulfil our own responsibilities, but we cannot take over the responsibilities of the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">So the fact is that the question of reopening and the question of safety standards must be settled primarily by the French and Italian authorities. There is a procedure for that. That procedure has been completed and we have the result. If those authorities come to the conclusion that reopening is justified, then that is what must happen. On the other hand, we must also be clear at European level that we can only act within the framework of our own competencies. The fact is, too, that the very White Paper that my colleague Mrs de Palacio has presented, is intended first of all to clarify those competencies and secondly also to see that traffic becomes even safer and also that the environmental effects of traffic are kept in check so that there is no further damage to the particularly sensitive areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question of the Euro-toll disc regulation, as I said, we shall be submitting a draft for it in 2002. In this connection we shall also be considering whether it is necessary to create some kind of transitional arrangement for the transit agreement with the Republic of Austria. Essentially, this depends on how quickly our Member States and the European Parliament can agree on the contents of the White Paper. It will not be possible to actually implement these things until we are in a position to create a new, improved infrastructure costs directive and adopt the other parts of the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have the answer to the question. The Commission has no way – no legal way in particular – of preventing the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel. But I am very much in favour of an appropriately intensive debate on the new White Paper so that definite decisions can be taken as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
