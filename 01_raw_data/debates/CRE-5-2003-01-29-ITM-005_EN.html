I wonder if the European Parliament might find a way of establishing some sort of mutual respect or paying heed to the issues that arise from the functioning of the presidency, bearing in mind that the Greek Presidency will have to go back to Greece at some point within the not too distant future. In all events, even if Parliament cannot find a way and cannot abide by a few rules, we shall abide by them, as befits our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Now on the question of the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Congo, I have this to say: the international community has started to evince a keen interest in the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Africa over recent years, especially where they are used to fund long-term, catastrophic armed conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">The chairman of the United Nations Security Council made a statement in June 2000 calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a committee of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This committee was set up and started work in September 2000 and published its final report in October 2002, in which it points out that high-ranking political, military and business figures in Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, as well as the Congo, are plundering the natural – mainly mineral – wealth of the Congo on a massive scale for personal gain or, in the case of Rwanda, for their country’s benefit. At the same time, again according to the committee’s findings, Rwanda is funding its massive military budget mainly from resources taken from the Congo, occasionally using forced local labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has refrained from passing a resolution on this recent report by the committee of experts until the Security Council does so. However, the European Union is in favour of introducing a ban and of imposing sanctions as and where necessary, preferably through the United Nations Security Council, rather than by individual countries or groups of countries. As far as one particularly controversial product is concerned – so-called blood diamonds – both the international community and the European Union have taken specific action. To be precise, thirty-seven countries and the European Parliament finalised a certification process for uncut diamonds at Interlaken in Switzerland in November 2002, the so-called Kimberley process, precisely in a bid to fight the trade in illegally mined diamonds from conflict zones, especially in Africa. The European Union also adopted Council resolution 2368/2002 on the application of the Kimberley certification process on 20 December, which is when it became operational.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by pointing out that there is a basic vicious circle here that needs to be broken. Internal armed conflict opens the way for the illegal exploitation of the basic wealth of a country and in turn this wealth is exploited to perpetuate the internal armed conflict and the lack of development and stability mechanisms in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the fact that the plunder of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be one of the main elements fuelling the conflict in the Great Lakes Region.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission has worked actively with the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo since its establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission organised a meeting in Kinshasa between the experts and the heads of Commission delegations in countries covered by the investigation. The Commission stands ready to continue this constructive cooperation in the future, if required to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken careful note of the report of the panel of experts, which was the subject of a resolution in the UN Security Council last week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that measures have been taken by the Congolese authorities in relation to officials named in the reports and that the government of Uganda has established a judicial commission of inquiry. The Commission shares the UN Security Council's call for all states concerned, in particular Zimbabwe and Rwanda, to conduct investigations and to take appropriate measures in relation to their nationals cited in the report, where the circumstances are justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which really took hold of the country during the war, will only come to an end once the rule of law is really established. Saying that it is restored is a euphemistic reference to the historic reality of that country, but with rule of law and viable administration things can be different. This needs to happen not only in the zones controlled by armed rebel groups, but also over the entire Congolese territory. In that context, the Commission calls on all parties to the Pretoria Agreement signed last December to implement it without delay and to do so in the spirit of the agreement. Moreover, the Commission welcomes the decision taken in Sun City in the framework of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, to establish a special committee to examine the validity of economic and financial agreements made during the war which relate to the exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Together with other donors, the Commission is prepared to support the Democratic Republic of Congo in the transition process and in its efforts to establish an efficient public administration. Recently, the Commission adopted a decision for the grant of EUR 16 million to support capacity building in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new problem we are discussing. Extraction of mineral wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not a story of transparency and good governance. This was the case long before, during, and after the Mobutu regime. In the footsteps of Laurent Kabila's advances towards Kinshasa, mining concessions changed hands – as did ownership, town by town – as new warlords became masters locally and militarily. This became the subject of the aforementioned investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that, in order to ensure effective action against the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the entire international community must work together. The United Nations Security Council is the appropriate forum to ensure such concerted action. However, given the cross-border nature of the problem, the Commission considers that regional integration bodies such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) should also address the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the initiative by the United Nations to organise an international conference on peace, democracy, security and development in the Great Lakes Region. This conference could address the different aspects of illegal exploitation of natural resources from a regional perspective, as part of a long-term strategy and also for the purposes of conflict prevention. It is very important that we guarantee ownership rights and a steady progress towards transparency in these matters, even without UN Security Council resolutions which have a limited reach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution is an important step forward in favour of international law and the rule of law. As we speak, there are some 48 civil conflicts around the world – the majority of them in Africa – being conducted largely in the promotion of one or more supposed sectional or tribal interests. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen millions of people massacred, genocide committed, whole tribes ethnically cleansed in the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ostensibly, these conflicts have been based, as in Angola or Rwanda, on so-called historic divisions. But the reality is that an underlying factor in most of these cases has been commercial gain, based on supposed tribal protection. Various sectional and commercial interests, some of them based in Europe, have tried to exploit these differences for commercial gain to procure the supply of diamonds, timber, oil, gold, cobalt, titanium and vanadium.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is supposed to be one of the richest continents in the world, inhabited by the poorest people in the world. How can this be so? This is so because the rule of law and international law has not operated in Africa for a long time. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been exploited, looted and robbed. Its people have been set against one another, encouraged to massacre each other and sometimes to commit genocide, so that powerful vested interests outside Africa can collude and gain advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by the United Nations Security Council is a seminal report in that it sets out for the first time to establish that international law incorporates a moral right to a concept of shared sovereignty, that sovereignty is not merely what is defined in the Montevideo Convention or President Wilson's 14-point rule, and that in a global trading environment as we see now with the WTO and global rules on trade, we have to share our sovereignty when the rule of law becomes paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">If we can penalise the United States for doing something wrong with its steel, why is it that we are not able to do something in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where millions of people have been exploited and killed for commercial gain?</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome this resolution and I commend it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, armed conflict in the region has ended. It is now time to launch the process of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and peace in that country depend on establishing democracy and sustainable development. As regards establishing democracy, we trust the Pretoria Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages. The Pretoria Agreement is truly an all-encompassing and inclusive agreement. An all-embracing system of democracy can only be established if all associations and political groupings are included in the process. This is especially important in the Great Lakes Region where a breakdown in social order was the root cause of the wars that laid waste to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Brussels yesterday and also the Commission’s decision to send a significant amount of humanitarian aid to the worst affected areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of major problems are still outstanding, however. They must be resolved to assure the future of the region. Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions, once implementation of the agreement is under way. The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice. Impunity is incompatible with democracy and there can be no peace without a system of justice. In this connection, I would like to table an amendment to indent 4 tomorrow. I would like to replace the phrase referring to other places, when these acts have been committed with one referring to other places, including the acts committed.</p>
<p class="contents">The other element crucial to the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo is sustainable development. The countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process. Companies can play their part by adopting an ethical code of conduct demonstrating commitment to sustainable development. Countries can be involved by establishing measures to limit the importation of goods of dubious origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world. In this regard, we attach great importance to compliance with rules on child labour, the ILO labour standards, the sustainable exploitation of resources and the OECD’s guidelines on multinational companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations report adopts a clear stance on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We hope Member States, the Commission and Parliament will all insist on implementation of the report’s recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course we too agree that the illegal exploitation of the natural resources in Congo must be strongly condemned. Of course we too agree that people and companies who enrich themselves from war must be stopped and punished. We therefore welcome the fair analysis, the first in the hundred years since the plundering of Congo began. It is, therefore, quite simply a shame that the report is so sloppy and that it contains so many unfounded accusations and inaccuracies. This list of shame could have been an historic precedent, a warning to all leaders and business people who unscrupulously exploit the misery of millions for personal gain. Instead it has become a weak, contentious document based on rumours and war propaganda. Indeed, it has created an amalgam of illegal and illicit activities, and the persons and companies named in it were never heard, let alone given the opportunity to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the report was weighed and found wanting by the Security Council this week. The mandate of the experts was extended by six months. The Security Council is absolutely right to urge that all the named countries institute their own investigation on the basis of which legal action can be taken. We have submitted an amendment to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more fundamental, however, is the question as to how illegal exploitation can be avoided and counteracted in the future; in other words, how a new stable and democratic order can be established in Congo that will ensure that the country’s resources are exploited in a controlled and sustainable manner in order to benefit the entire Congolese population. The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this. It is to be hoped that the Security Council will also search its conscience, review MONUC’s mandate, increase the number of troops and do everything necessary to speed up the application of the peace accords and the installation of new structures, so that in a few years’ time it will not be faced once more with the realisation that Congo is still being plundered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, under the dictatorship of President Mobutu, the country has fallen into economic and political crisis. We should be aware that the GNP per inhabitant has decreased to one sixth of what it was twenty years ago. I believe this to be linked, among other things, to the disappearance of the official channels and administration, so that informal activities have acquired an importance that is unheard of elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">While it has enormous potential in terms of agricultural, forestry and mining resources – on which subject I agree with my colleague – the paradox is that the Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world. This situation is, I believe, the result of bad management, including bad management of the economy and of the failing infrastructure, but also of the illegal exploitation of wealth. That is the important thing about the United Nations report. As mining resources are already largely diminished almost all over the world, and exhausted in several countries, those being exploited in the Congo are quite economically attractive, particularly due to the low costs involved in their sale. I think that we have a real responsibility in this respect. The United Nations report warns us about the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC by private European companies, which is particularly of concern to us, and by neighbouring countries, which also have responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Johannesburg Summit, the provisions laid down by the International Criminal Court and the Cotonou agreements, and in response to this scandal which I believe threatens the global ecosystem and to the reign of poaching and violations of human rights, I believe that the European Union should ask the UN Security Council to initiate proceedings against those who are implicated, particularly by freezing assets and conducting enquiries into pogroms and other acts of violence committed against the people. The Council and the Commission should also equip themselves with a restrictive legal framework and demand, in particular, greater transparency in the way that markets are allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, I would like to say that, in this battle in which we are all engaged against physical attacks on people and for peace and sustainable development, the key notes must be the preservation of the environment, social justice and good governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Millions of citizens are living in appalling conditions. Famine and AIDS are the daily lot of men and women in the grip of an interminable conflict, stirred up by the presence of so-called elite networks who are taking advantage of a chaotic situation in order to make a profit. The top political leaders, regional and foreign companies and the armed forces have established what appears to be a real war economy. They are stirring up, under the cover of political or ethnic opposition, a conflict whose only goal has become to simply plunder the natural resources of the DRC, to the detriment of the local populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations report that we presented to the Committee on Development and Cooperation is, in our opinion, a significant opportunity to put an end to this human tragedy. The list of people involved in this damaging trafficking should be the spearhead for us to launch genuine and forceful action.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we now need to put pressure on our own companies to stop taking advantage of confused situations or even creating them in order to make a fraudulent profit. We should not delude ourselves any longer. The responsibility of companies is now closely linked to that of our governments. If we do not promptly give a strong political signal by taking restrictive action against them and stressing our support for the principles of the OECD, they will continue to violate the law and human rights without batting an eyelid. We can no longer turn a blind eye to what is nothing more and nothing less than neo-colonial plundering in disguise.</p>
<p class="contents">By forcing European companies in foreign countries to make their accounts public, we will enable greater transparency and will also limit the illegal misappropriation of which the Congolese people are the prime victims. It is clear that establishing the rule of law and democratic institutions will be essential. But prior coordinated action among Member States aimed at putting an end to their own companies' activities has become essential. It is high time that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo benefited fully and directly from their land’s resources and achieved the level of development that their mining resources would allow if they were not constantly being illegally exploited by foreign powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Numerous private undertakings have also joined in helping themselves to the country's raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Although firms from outside Europe are also involved, we should very definitely be working through and analysing the list naming European firms and private individuals. This should be done in the individual Member States and with a view to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that there is much of a distinction of substance to be drawn between this case and the way in which corrupt African regimes grant licenses for the extraction of raw materials, with part of the license fees or indeed of the proceeds going straight into the ruler's personal bank account. Some of this may even be listed as a receipt in the state's budget, but it is virtually unheard of for the people to benefit from it in the shape of infrastructure or health provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that these regimes can only keep themselves in power because they are kept by Europe means that what we need is a debate, in plain words, on the principles by which we Europeans are guided in our dealings with Africa. There is an unspeakable and unacceptable discrepancy between, on the one hand, the text of the Cotonou Treaty and the honeyed words that we will get to hear in Lisbon over the coming weeks at the Franco-African and EU-African summits, and, on the other, the brutal reality of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot fail to observe that certain governments collude and collaborate with European firms that then provide certain regimes with a lifeline in order to maximise their own profits. If we do not speak frankly about these things, we will bring about no real change in the situations in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was therefore with despair that I saw it swallowed by war and with relief that I welcomed the Pretoria agreements, which are a promise of peace and democratisation in this martyred region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Congo has exceptional natural resources. In 1997, the value of the resources in the North was estimated at USD 25 billion. The minerals: zinc, lead, iron, tungsten, cadmium, cobalt and germanium are unique, and germanium has semi-conducting powers that are now used to make the most powerful microchip in the world, to say nothing of radium, lithium and niobium, which produce superconductive alloys at high temperatures, or diamonds, silver, platinum, and so on. It is probably the country with the greatest resources in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, along with the neighbouring countries concerned, it has to be said that Western predators have pounced on it under all sorts of pretexts, exterminating its population and using Africans to fight a Western war. It is a veritable holocaust. People are quoting figures of 4.5 million Congolese victims since 1998, 2.5 million people displaced, 16 million condemned to death, thousands deported to Rwanda and Uganda, and I prefer not to mention the details of the massacres that have taken place, which are unbearable.</p>
<p class="contents">So yes, I am in favour of this resolution, and if it turns out that my country, as has been suggested by a panel of experts, is harbouring any of the predators that are fuelling the war, Belgium will not evade its responsibilities. It will conduct the necessary enquiries and will ensure that there are repercussions. It will not add complicity in the present to the burden of past colonisation. However, there is one condition: the UN resolution last week on the same subject stressed that the panel of experts is not a judicial power and that therefore, the results that it gives cannot be considered to be established facts and cannot therefore automatically lead to penalties. The right to defence must be preserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Other countries too in old and new Europe are, however, guilty of plundering the natural resources of Africa. It is simply not acceptable that this is still going on. It is now no longer the old mother countries but, deservedly or undeservedly, European companies who are named in the UN report. Europe must in any event take measures, because we have a collective historic responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just returned from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I also listened to the Africans there. They are expecting a lot from Europe – for example, reparations of a kind. A committee of enquiry has been set up in the Belgian Senate which will look into the illegal trade in raw materials in the region of the Great Lakes. The main issue for Europe is that the Commission should propose a directive on the control of European companies that operate outside the European Union and that this directive should be quickly made law by every Member State. On the other hand, a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up. The United Nations has a more urgent assignment here than in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Mugabe regime is a criminal racket and a major factor of instability, not just in southern Africa but, as the report makes clear, in central Africa as well. The report describes the conflicts fought over minerals, farm produce, land and tax revenues by criminal groups linked to the Zimbabwean armed forces which have, for example, transferred at least five billion dollars' worth of assets from the state mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to companies under its control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities. The report not only provides evidence of the involvement of Mugabe in these activities, but names a numbers of other senior Zimbabweans, four of whom are subject to the EU's restrictive measures but four of whom, to my astonishment, are not.</p>
<p class="contents">The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation. Two days ago, the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe. Is it not therefore bewildering to the oppressed people of Zimbabwe that two European governments now seek to delay the renewal and dilute the force of the travel ban and other restrictive measures that the European Union has put in place against the Mugabe regime and which are due to expire on 18 February 2003? Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris? One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow. This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regime; instead, international action must be intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">May I ask the President of the Council and the Commission, in accordance with the clearly expressed wishes of this House over a year or more, to insist that sanctions be renewed unequivocally and that the EU measures be extended to include all of those involved in this racket in Zimbabwe and the Congo. The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through, for the benefit of all Zimbabweans.</p>

If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources, Africa would have far less in the way of problems. The United Nations report has spelled out, albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity, the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth. The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation. There is a lamentable lack of responsibility, not only on the part of criminal elements, but also on the part of governments who would rather line their own pockets, and also in European business circles. European enterprises must be made aware that the unscrupulous exploitation of Africa's natural resources is not a petty offence, and so Europe's policies must set a good example. Illegal actions must be punished, and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect. We need to work on a much broader basis on the issue of transparency and the principles of licensing. I just came back from Angola and the discussion about creating more transparency on oil revenue for the government is an extremely important matter. Even if there are not conflicts as such, progress in this area is important also for economic reasons. In the event of conflict, it becomes totally brutal and perverse.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gahler related what we discussed here to the broader issue of Africa, mentioning also the coming summit in Lisbon. One conclusion is that raising these problems with our friends in Africa collectively injects serious substance into the debates we can have at summits such as the one in Lisbon, which is one good reason why we have to ensure that the summit is a success. We can use those types of meetings to push these issues. Of course, this will be more effective if we have a clear and clean conscience ourselves. This is not just an issue in the form of a narrow debate. I definitely regard the link to using the OECD principles relating to this as a way of advancing transparency in relation to the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, this is of the utmost importance. It is not enough to look at the public budget in a narrow sense when we talk about governance in our partner countries. I would mention, by way of example, the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad. This has now been incorporated into a framework of strong conditions governing transparency and the use of the revenue from that pipeline, in the context of the discussions between the World Bank, the IMF, ourselves and the government of Chad. This is just to illustrate that there are many things that it is possible to do in this. But definitely the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worse of them all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
