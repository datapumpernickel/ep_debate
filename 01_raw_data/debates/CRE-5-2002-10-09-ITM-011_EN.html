<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact – perhaps an agreeable fact at this hour of the day – that I am able today to present to you a draft report that has been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I take great pleasure in the fact that we expressly welcome the Commission's ideas relating to the fraud-proofing of legislation and contract management. It is always cheaper to avoid or prevent fraud than it is to attempt, after the event and at great expense, to put things right. I would like to bring up a couple of other items that we would like to see reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, fraud-proofing must not be allowed to unduly prolong the preparation of European legislation, nor must it be limited exclusively to new draft laws. On the contrary, existing legislation must also be checked for flaws. I believe it to be also a credibility issue that we should, in tandem with this draft law from the Commission, start to scrutinise policies that we know, Commissioner, to be an invitation to fraud – the examples that come to my mind include export refunds in the area of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to hold fast to the primary purpose of the anti-fraud office, OLAF, which is, of course, to combat fraud and corruption and not to do the things proposed here. We are prepared, however, within the framework of the 2003 work programme, to examine whether OLAF has sufficient human and financial resources at its disposal to effectively perform the duties transferred to it. Here too we have to discuss whether we can transfer an increasing number of tasks to this Office. We have had to note a cut in its budget for the coming year. Parliament is trying to get matters back in some sort of order, but this is not just about the Budget; it is quite simply about the fact that we know that one of the reasons for the failure of OLAF's predecessor, UCLAF, was that it did everything and therefore managed nothing. The main focus here, then, must be on the essentials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our view that standard contracts and agreements should be drawn up and collected centrally, and that this would make it easier to track and monitor parties to contracts and transactions under them. We take the view that a clause should be incorporated into the contracts and agreements to exclude from the award of future contracts those partners guilty of any fraudulent act. Here too we urge the Commission to give priority to more consistent application of the options that are already available. It is a tragedy, for example, when EUROSTAT repeatedly points out that firms cannot be got rid of even when it is proven that they gave false information as early as the stage of putting out to tender. Where does that get us? That is surely a credibility issue! The combating of fraud is essentially a credibility issue, and credibility is something the Commission has yet to provide in various areas.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat, we are very satisfied with what the Commission has submitted here. What really will make a difference is how it is implemented. What will matter, in the final analysis, is how seriously and with what transparency we want to remove the flaws from our own legislation. I would like to tell the Commissioner without any equivocation that, on this issue, we in Parliament are standing alongside the Commission, but we need openness, and, when it comes down to it, we also need transparency, if we are to be able to work together on these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's initiative both forms an important part of the work of reform as a whole and has a part to play in the Commission's overall strategy for the protection of financial interests. As you have emphasised, its aim is to improve the fraudproofing of Community policies and legislative proposals. The prevention of fraud is nothing new. It was and is a matter of major concern, and it must be comprehensive, meaning that it must, so to speak, be present right from the very outset, and hence – as you also emphasised – in the initiative and the proposal; it cannot be introduced later, at the implementation stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Fraud prevention is not the province of a few specialists alone, a fact that has led us to declare that inter-departmental cooperation must start at an earlier stage, rather than leaving all the work to OLAF. The expertise of the Directorates-General must be combined with the specialist knowledge that OLAF has gained from its practical experience. This sort of cross-fertilisation can be useful as a means of developing fraudproofing in such a way that legislative drafts are examined with a view to making them fraudproof. This is about establishing a method of working intended to combine this expertise with knowledge about prevention, and doing that without needlessly prolonging the legislative process. I fully agree with the emphasis you have put on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect has to do with making lawmaking simpler. It of course has a preventive function for the legislative process not to be so complicated that it becomes incapable of being monitored; simplification, on the other hand, also creates good openings for legal control. The fraudproofing mechanism is meant to help shape legislation in a way that makes it clear and fraudproof.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to enlarge on what you mentioned in that context; on the one hand new draft laws, and on the other, the checking of laws already in force. That, of course, again raises the question of the human resources available. We are now starting on current lawmaking processes, which is of course the first step. Once a procedure has become established, we will see to what extent we can apply this also to the amendment of laws, with which we are also constantly occupied.</p>
<p class="contents">OLAF is now getting on with drawing up criteria, appointing contact persons, and installing this mechanism. Let me, however, point out that making legislation fraudproof is not just a matter for the Commission, but legislators are also of course obliged, for their part, to treat this principle as a decisive criterion when framing laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with the additional observation that even the best policy of prevention can only be a success if it goes hand in hand with a credible framework of deterrence, as indeed, Mr Bösch, you emphasise in your report. Fraudproofing measures must not be allowed to limit in any way OLAF's firm action in bringing fraud and irregularities to light; they are merely supplementary to it. I might add that the Commission is endeavouring to bring about improvements in the area of criminal law. We have just had the hearing on the European Public Prosecutor, and will take this opportunity to thank Parliament for the great support it has given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only does combating fraud seem to be becoming an ongoing task in the EU, but the Commission is also showing a great deal of imagination when it comes to the ways and means, and it is again showing its capacity for fantasy with this communication on the fraudproofing of legislation and contract management – a high-sounding title in very truth. It remains to be seen whether the draft, when it comes to fruition, will also contain what has been promised. I think it right to be sceptical about that. Since taking office, this Commission has distinguished itself by placatory promises, the words of which have not been followed up by actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's announcement of its slogan ‘Zero Tolerance for Fraud and Irregularities’ has not prevented the officially-acknowledged fraud figures for 2000 from being higher than ever, and even those for 2001 from being, at EUR 1.25 billion, well above the average for previous years. Legislation and contracts are now to be drafted in such a way as to be fraudproof. It is as if they were meant to be stamped with the words ‘checked and found fraudproof’! Is that the big picture? Is it not self-evident that legal documents – insofar as such documents are at all able to do so – promote lawful rather than unlawful conduct when the EU's billions are handed out? Does the Commission not employ hosts of well-trained and highly-paid officials, and this objective not far from the least of those they are there to achieve? Actually, I do think, if we are really honest, that this communication is superfluous, promoting as it does something that goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only sum this up by saying that the Commission's clocks are obviously set differently after all. It is evidently necessary to lay down by means of an official communication that we must obey rather than disobey the law. I find that very worrying on the part of an institution that is the custodian of the European treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of that, should the Commission not at last deal with the cases of fraud that have come to light and draw the necessary conclusions? Is that not the method that promises success? To give one example, why does the Commission, with the resources at its disposal, not take a certain former lady Commissioner before the European Court of Justice? Providing a deterrent example for the future, that would be better targeted. But no, the Commission prefers to change the Financial Regulation in order to reduce transparency. It is still trying to limit Parliament's supervisory role, and it has done away with the independent financial controller.</p>
<p class="contents">All these points are referred to in Mr Bösch's Report, which I also fully endorse in other respects. If fraud is to be successfully combated, then decisive intervention is indispensable. Anything else can be nothing more than an accompanying measure. Now I do not want to use this opportunity to enlarge on criticism of the Commission's book-keeping system, although there seems to be a certain amount wrong with it, but it is rather sad how the Commission continues to deal with criticism. It seems to have learned nothing from it. Mr Bösch mentioned it, and I want to repeat it. A Danish official is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration, by which I mean what went on at Eurostat, to which our report makes reference. Despite this criticism – and despite what I am tempted to bluntly call adequate grounds for suspicion – the Commission continues to cooperate with a firm that operates in a highly questionable way, which has won contracts by deception and has failed to do any good work. This is something to which the Commission must respond. If it does not, it cannot be spared the criticism that communications such as this one are nothing more than diversionary manoeuvres! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
