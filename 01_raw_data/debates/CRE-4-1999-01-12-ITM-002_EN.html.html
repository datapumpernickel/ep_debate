<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lööw </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (SV)</span> Mr President, the background to this report stems from the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty represents a clear move towards establishing greater openness and transparency. This has also been an important goal for the European Parliament both before and during its work on the new Treaty. Since it is an issue which greatly affects the interests of our citizens and involves the democratic legitimacy of the EU, the Committee on Institutional Affairs felt that Parliament should produce an own‐initiative report in which it would establish certain principles for promoting openness in the EU institutions before the Commission puts forward its initial proposal for, amongst other things, a code on general principles, as it is expected to do upon ratification of the Treaty. This will also provide Parliament with another opportunity for raising the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has held a public hearing and a round table discussion, and the Directorate‐General for Research carried out a comparative study on legislation in the Member States relating to public access to information. It transpired that legislation varied considerably between individual countries. It would perhaps be in order to point out here that neither my report nor the Amsterdam Treaty attempts to impose changes on individual Member States. The remit is to establish a new code on public access to EU documents, as well as a new culture of openness and transparency in the Commission, Council and Parliament. However, the report points out that Members of the European Parliament would like such a principle to be applied to all EU institutions, regardless of the fact that it will be easier to achieve in some than in others. For instance, it is a foregone conclusion that Europol is less likely than a number of other institutions to allow public access to its documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam makes explicit reference to the public right of access to EU documents, and my report deals mainly with this principle. I share the view that our citizens regard access to documents as the linchpin on which the principle of public access to information hinges. Our citizens have a right to know what underlies decisions, so that they can form their own judgement as to whether they are appropriate. In this way, openness prevents corruption, abuse of power and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Broadly speaking, the proposal means that all incoming and outgoing documents of importance in the EU institutions should be public. Obviously, there are reasons for certain documents being classified, but these must be precisely defined in law. They should not be vague and general; and nor should the list of grounds for confidentiality be unduly long and detailed.</p>
<p class="contents">So that the public knows what documents are available, a public register should be set up and, of course, ways of tracing documents in the various institutions introduced. New technology such as the Internet should make it possible for all European citizens to access the register. Distance from Brussels need no longer be an obstacle to our citizens fully exercising their right to view documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was overwhelmingly agreed, even though in the course of our work I detected a degree of scepticism about securing broad support for such radical changes, which after all go much further than current practice in many Member States. I would also dare to hope that there will be broad support in the final vote, which would naturally put strong pressure on the Commission to come up with a proposal that meets Parliament's requirements. There was also some scepticism as to whether the Commission would really introduce a principle that allowed the public access to EU documents, since this would require a whole new culture. I think I should warn you that a considerable effort will be required; it will not be handed over on a plate. It is not as simple as drawing up a new code. It will require new working practices and probably new equipment, but above all resources for staff training. I must say that in fact it all fits in very well with the much‐needed reforms which the President of the Commission promised yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Having directed most of my remarks at the Commission, I should also point out that the same applies to all the EU institutions. The Council in particular should concentrate on living up to it own proposal in the Treaty. Parliament also has a considerable way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deals with many other issues related to openness and transparency, such as more open meetings and greater use of the Internet for disseminating information and informing people about the issues under discussion. However, we need not go any further into this, since it is all in the report. I shall therefore devote the rest of my speaking time to some comments on the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments were studied in committee and rejected by a large majority. It is the duty of a rapporteur to be sensitive to the views of the committee as a whole, so I am not going to endorse them, even though I am sympathetic towards one or two, especially the two relating to the ‘guaranteed freedom of speech for officials', which is a central and very special feature in the principle of public access to information in Sweden. Under this, civil servants who pass on information to the media are afforded protection. Such a law does not even exist in the other Scandinavian countries and, in my opinion, it would be futile to try to introduce similar legislation into the EU at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">One amendment also says that EU legislation should not supersede national legislation. It would be appropriate for me to end with a comment on this. My aim with this report is to see that EU legislation on openness and transparency is shaped in a way that is acceptable to all Member States and does not conflict with national legislation, no matter how far reaching the latter may be.</p>

We can only defend ourselves against this accusation by ensuring greater transparency and democratic control. The citizens of Europe have a right to that. Transparency and democratic control will bring us closer to the people, something we should not just think about every five years just before the elections. Much remains to be done. That is apparent not just from Mrs Lööw"s report. It is apparent also from the 20 conclusions set out in my opinion, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights approved unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">What I consider most important of all is to make improved access of the citizens to information the focal point of transparency. In this regard, Finland and Sweden have developed an enviable culture of transparency. We should take a leaf out of their book throughout the European Union. In fact, why should we deny the people the widest possible access to our files and documents? What actually prevents us from widening this right and also giving it to Parliament"s rapporteurs and others? Why can the Council not work just as openly as the European Parliament to a large extent does?</p>
<p class="contents">Why do Council and Commission representatives have their own fixed seat in our committees, while Parliament does not in theirs, nor even its rapporteurs? But more transparency is not enough in itself if we want to come closer to the citizens. In addition to making political procedures and decision‐making processes transparent, we must give the citizens a say. The European Union institutions must develop mechanisms to enable the citizens to bring their own ideas and thoughts into the decision‐making process. That is a basic requirement of democracy. If we are to build the Europe of the future, we need the participation of all concerned, not least for the sake of our credibility.</p>

Perhaps the members and colleagues in the Committee on Institutional Affairs will be able to judge for themselves just how pleased I am, given that I have been badgering them with this demand for four years, to which the reply tended to be that the time is not yet ripe. Mr Herman, Mr Bourlanges, the time can become ripe very quickly, although perhaps it needed a green President‐in‐Office of the Council!</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of this report today also relates to this deep process of democratisation that we need. This is a particularly backward area of democratisation that we are considering today, but perhaps that is partly due to a misunderstanding. We usually refer to transparency, to public relations, to the information services here in Parliament and in the appropriate committees. But in that way we tend to reveal rather than resolve the democratic crisis in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency means clarity. The corresponding democratic concept here is openness to the public. It is this openness to the public to which the citizens of Europe have a right: open legislation (not transparent legislation but legislation in public), the public justification by the administration of all its acts, rights of control and information for Parliament, in the second and third pillar too, public decisions and decision‐making bases, in the area also of internal security and foreign policy, and the rights of the citizen to information (not the information services), the press services, the public relations work of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of transparency or of concepts that have no part in the democratic tradition but tend rather to be public relations exercises. It is a question of the people"s right to openness as the foundation of democracy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lenz </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, it may be a coincidence that we are discussing a report about openness in the Union this week, but it really does make Mrs Lööw"s text a very topical one. Had there been more transparency or more openness, then perhaps the Commission and the European Parliament would not have been in the situation of having to hold the debates we are holding this week. But here too we need rules of play, for then openness really can provide the citizen with reliable information, which, God knows, we need. After all, electoral campaigns always reveal the deficits in this area very clearly. However, what we need is not market criers but precise information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lööw report on openness within the European Union is a serious attempt to give just that precision to the relevant provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty. An interinstitutionally agreed code of conduct is to be formulated to that end. That is a difficult but a truly necessary task. In any case the proposed provisions are likely to create considerably more openness. I am sure further discussion will still be needed of some of the proposals, if they are also to apply to institutions such as the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors and the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly desirable – and here too we welcome the Lööw report – for Council and Coreper decisions to become more transparent by improved access to their documents, for the EU administration to provide the citizen with information more rapidly and courteously – which should really be a matter of course – and for multilingualism to be maintained precisely for the sake of transparency. Today it is clear that modern electronic techniques have to be used. Yet we should not go quite as far as most of the amendments, especially Amendment No 4. However, my group will endorse the broad lines of the report. The report demands a great deal and of course the European Parliament must also realise that this would mean creating the appropriate financial and staffing conditions, to avoid being told afterwards by the Commission and all the other institutions that any lack of efficiency was simply due to a lack of the necessary resources. That, after all, is the reason for the dilemma we now find ourselves in. I really would wish to avoid that and I hope this report on openness within the Union will create the necessary bases for doing so.</p>

A fundamental truth has emerged today: we need uniform practices in public administrations. We cannot go on living with 15 different cultures and 15 different concepts. It only leads to rumours about a lack of transparency. However, what I found disturbing in yesterday's discussions was that the President of the Commission made absolutely no mention of a timetable for establishing a code on public access to EU documents, as described by the rapporteur. When are we to see some action, and what principles will be included?</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem to be Parliament's responsibility. I am afraid the President of the Commission is firmly of the opinion that ‘<span class="italic">il faut faire une profonde réflexion</span> '. We should therefore all support the principles laid down by Mrs Lööw in her excellent report. Mr Gebhardt's intervention also contained some very good points. We should have a code that includes clear rights for our citizens and obligations for the institutions. It is vital that we dispel the current distrust in the EU institutions and restore their credibility.</p>

Yesterday"s debates demonstrated that very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur points out that greater transparency is vital for the future of the European Union. The citizens of the Union often perceive it as distant and bureaucratic. Mrs Lööw also tells us that transparency can help prevent corruption and abuses of power.</p>
<p class="contents">There are thus two main aspects to this report: form and substance. Form is not just about wording, it also has to do with attitude. And I think that our rapporteur has defined it very well. The second aspect is the substance. Europe will never make progress until the European institutions, ourselves, but also the Commission – and this was debated at length yesterday – provide the necessary elements to facilitate understanding of their work, and this is true for all the information given to the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the judgements made about European action and development to meet our hopes, then our duty as Members of the European Parliament is to improve the information the citizens receive. Mr President, we think that this report is particularly well‐balanced and the Union for Europe Group will be pleased to vote for it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sjöstedt </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, more openness in law‐making and administration is crucial for the democratisation of the EU. Openness is the best remedy for corruption and poor administration, because it enables the public to identify the law‐makers and hold them to account. For that reason, I welcome the Lööw report. I share most of the rapporteur's views, even though I believe that the report could have gone further and been somewhat clearer on a number of crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the President of the Commission has not understood the meaning of real openness, as demonstrated by two actual examples. First of all, the suspension of its official, Mr Van Buitenen, who revealed the truth about fraud to Parliament, shows the Commission's authoritarian attitude. There is consequently a need for guaranteed freedom of speech to protect the right of officials to make public statements without fear of retribution, and I have tabled an amendment to this effect. Secondly, Mr Santer's letter to the Swedish Prime Minster, Göran Persson, was a noteworthy incident. It is totally unacceptable for the Commission to act like a thought police when an EU head of government criticises its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The weak point in the Lööw report is the proposal relating to open meetings of the Council. It is a fact of democratic life that all law‐making should be public. However, this is not what Mrs Lööw is demanding. But why should European citizens be content with anything less than complete transparency in the decision‐making and legislative processes? After all, that is what normal democracy is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other areas where the report would be improved by the inclusion of the amendments tabled by the GUE/NGL Group. It is important that the EU should not intrude on national rules relating to openness. This can and does occur as a result of the excessive secrecy that exists within the EU, as for example when the Council appealed to the Court of Justice over the so‐called Journalist Case. The Council's action directly called into question the rules on openness and constitutional law at national level. That case, like many others, demonstrates the need for a quick and inexpensive way of appealing against decisions by the EU to withhold certain documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater openness is vital for the process of democratisation in the EU. It is therefore regrettable that concern over this issue, both in committee and in the tabling of amendments, was shown above all by Members from the Nordic countries. The Lööw report is an important and constructive piece of work, and is worthy of greater attention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Amadeo </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty explicitly introduces the notion that Europe's administrations must become more transparent; indeed, it makes specific reference to public access to documents of the three institutions. In our opinion this transparency should be extended to all European bodies and fostered by other means too, such as public access to meetings, open administration, the drafting of clearer and simpler texts, a solution to the problem of multilingualism, and so on. We are convinced that such transparency must be a real aspiration, not just a verbal one, an expression of political intent, not just a bureaucratic act ultimately leading to confusion and away from the truth, in a deliberate bid to avoid clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask ourselves this: how much can our citizens, today, feel part of an institutional Europe which is increasingly complex and muddled? How much can we encourage them to understand the workings of our institutions, now that these are more relevant than ever and now that decisions taken by the Community bodies affect our daily lives, if there are no means of involving the citizens themselves in the procedures and enabling them to understand the reasons for the decisions made? How much can we stress the remoteness of the institutions from the citizens, without running the risk of generating that disgust, that rejection of Europe which is unfortunately all too evident? How much strain can we place on public disaffection, without running the risk of alienating our citizens once and for all from the centres of decision‐making?</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that the sad affair of fraud and misappropriation of European taxpayers' money, underlined by the refusal of this House to grant discharge for 1996, is currently casting dark shadows over the Community's whole executive, it must nevertheless be brought to public attention. We are duty‐bound to do so, having been elected by our citizens to represent them in this House. The risk is, however, that those citizens will become increasingly disaffected.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the numbers not voting at recent elections in various parts of Europe serve to trigger alarm bells, showing that people have lost confidence: instead of going to vote, they opt for a Sunday outing. This attitude is becoming dangerous in that while on the one hand it leaves them at the mercy of decisions taken by others – generally active members of traditional political parties – on the other, it means that in the longer term they fall prey to the latest demagogues and populists.</p>
<p class="contents">A key feature of our contemporary society, based on the supremacy of law, is to involve the citizens in political decision‐making, shaped until recently by national governments and now the prerogative of our Community institutions. Thus the citizens are entitled not only to feel the effects of political decisions, but also to participate in taking them. If transparency is to encompass all forms of public access to information and decision‐making, democratic control implies that our citizens should not only participate but should also be allowed a supervisory role.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maij‐Weggen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the reports by Mrs Lööw and Mr Brok on the transparency of the European institutions and the way the Commission President is elected could not have been presented at a better time. As far as transparency is concerned, Monday made it all the more clear that the closed bastion of European bureaucracy must be thrown open. Parliament has tried to do this through the Amsterdam Treaty by calling for all documents used in preparing European legislation to have to be made open and open meetings of the Council when it is dealing with legislation. These wishes have only been granted in part. Yesterday"s tough debate once again makes it clear that further steps must be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to go further on this point. I believe we need a law, a European directive, on transparency of government at European level so that the public and Parliament do not have to depend on random promises, but on clear European law.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission President, I should like to make one small comment. I also support the Brok report, but I believe that the code which the Commission is now proposing should make it clearer that European Commissioners hold office on behalf of the European administration and on behalf of Europe, and not on behalf of their national Member States. That is one of the points which has led to the degeneration we have seen, and it is something that needs to be laid down as soon as possible in an internal code for the Commission. This is what I wanted to stress in connection with the Brok report. This concludes my comments.</p>

It is a good start, although it does not go far enough. The proposals relating to guaranteed freedom of speech for officials, public access to Council meetings of a legislative nature and the right of appeal to the Court of Justice against decisions to withhold documents, without incurring costs, do give the report some muscle.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have evidence of what a lack of openness and public access to information can lead to. It is very likely that this debate on a vote of confidence would never have taken place if we had had a comprehensive code on openness, guaranteed freedom of speech and so on, which are the subject of today's discussion. The best and probably the only way of pre‐empting similar debates in future is to open up the administration by establishing a register of incoming documents, with clear rules about what should be public and what should be classified, and with freedom of speech and open Council meetings. Three cheers for the report and the five amendments!</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to give two examples. The first is that the world over, all over the earth, only two bodies meet behind closed doors: one is the Council of Ministers of the European Union and the other is the People's National Assembly in China. And, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder why we pass resolutions about China and accuse it of a lack of democracy and transparency, when the Council of Ministers of the European Union is doing exactly the same thing. The second example is the dismissal of a certain Commission staff member. Do you know what message emerges from that dismissal? The message that the Commission pays its staff, and indeed pays them well, to work, see and hear, but not speak out. They must not even say anything to the European Parliament, because it is not in our interests to hear what goes on in the Commission. I therefore congratulate the rapporteurs. My group will vote for their report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sierra González </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, a democratic society is one where an ordinary citizen can ascertain the identity of administrators and the nature of their actions, and when, as a result of this knowledge, that citizen can attribute responsibility when appropriate and monitor the ends pursued through political action. This is the only way of preventing the abuse of power.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the citizens of today"s European Union are still denied information on fundamental issues relating to justice and home affairs. Regulatory documents are drafted in secret. Decisions are taken without the reasons for them being made public, alleging that public order and internal security are at stake. In the past, therefore, institutions have been able to treat the principle of confidentiality in a cavalier fashion, and they continue to do so today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk of working towards greater transparency and openness to bring the institutions of the European Union closer to the citizen. What is really at issue, however, is making the new Europe and its institutions democratically legitimate. That is the real aim. The Treaty of Amsterdam represented a step in this direction, but more is needed. Administrators can still restrict information at their discretion, and that power must be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">This report represents an effort to restrict the powers of discretion available to European administrators, and that is why we support it. We believe this is the way forward.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span> <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Lööw and the Committee on Institutional Affairs for drawing up this report. It will be very much at the forefront of our minds in the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of the Treaty we have been entrusted with the task of presenting to Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal aimed at increasing the transparency of our institutional system, particularly as regards access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The services within the various institutions are currently debating the matter. As for ourselves, we shall put forward our proposal as from the entry into force of the Treaty. This issue is crucial to the future relationship between the European institutions and the citizens, who ought to be the key players in the system of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam process resulted in a Treaty that is very explicit in this regard, referring as it does to a range of issues that directly affect the citizens and the population as a whole. These issues relate to our citizens" rights, interests and legitimate aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, secrecy, the lack of clarity surrounding proceedings and decision‐making in the institutions, and the suspicion – only the suspicion – that information is suppressed are not conducive to a positive relationship between the Union and its citizens. This is why the Treaty of Amsterdam refers to transparency. The Commission will study this report very carefully. It will help us to prepare our own proposal. We shall also bear in mind the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to several key aspects of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it has to be said that the text and, in particular, the context of the debates, has clearly demonstrated the extent to which the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam modify the present situation. As far as access to documents is concerned, certain interinstitutional arrangements are currently in place, and each institution also has its own procedures. However, these procedures depend heavily on the good will of each institution, with scant backing from Court decisions. The Treaty lays down an absolute right to transparency, which must be enshrined in a legislative act and in internal provisions made by each of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must remember that greater freedom of access to documents is not an aim in itself. Rather, it should lead to increased transparency of procedures and a clearer appreciation of political and institutional responsibilities. Transparency should enable us to put across to the citizen a better picture of how each institution operates. We need to dispel the myth that decisions are taken by Brussels bureaucrats who are out of touch with reality. In this regard, the interinstitutional agreement on the quality of legislation should be welcomed. It represents a significant step towards legislation the citizen will find easier to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and in conclusion, I should like to refer to the issue of information, which was raised by a number of speakers. Adequate information is obviously the most important aspect of transparency. A transparent system cannot really come about without information, nor can progress be made along the course plotted by this Parliament. Action has been taken in this regard. A large number of documents are now available on the Internet and this means that all these documents, which are by definition public documents, are now actually accessible. Previously, access to them was fraught with complications. Work along these lines must continue, bearing in mind of course that written information, oral information and direct contact with the citizens are nevertheless essential.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I should once again like to congratulate the rapporteur on her significant report. We shall give it serious consideration when drafting our legislative proposal.</p>
