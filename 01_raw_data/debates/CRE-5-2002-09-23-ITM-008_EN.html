<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paulsen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, almost two years have now passed since October 2000 when the Commission tabled a very good proposal for a regulation on the permitted uses of those parts of slaughtered animals that are not for human consumption. I must say that it was alarming to discover the amount of filth and other peculiar material that found its way into animal feed and the food chain. That is something that is now to be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal was a good one. Parliament nonetheless made it very significantly better, simpler, stricter and more transparent than it had been at the beginning. At first reading, we had 99 amendments, and the Council accepted 90 of them. At second reading, we tabled nine amendments and, of these, eight were approved. The ninth – a compromise amendment – we eventually saw approved almost in its entirety. We had a proposal, however, in which we instructed the Commission to put forward a proposal and, in that respect, those of us in Parliament no doubt exceeded the limits of our powers. The Commission has nonetheless voluntarily promised to table the proposal we requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s most important tightening-up of the proposal involved a future total ban on ‘cannibalism’ in the handling of animal feed. It will no longer be permitted to feed animals on protein derived from animals of the same species. Researchers now believe that such feeding is a possible cause of ‘mad’ prions that give rise to BSE, TSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We obtained a total ban on all use of carcasses and parts of diseased animals either as protein meal or, above all, as fat. Such fat is particularly nauseating. Only raw materials declared entirely fit for human consumption will be allowed to be used in feed, cosmetics, medicines etc. It is only in cigarette filters, car tyres and such like that carcass fat will be permitted to be used in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have request and obtained a clear separation of the handling chains for the various animal by-products. It will not, for example, be permitted for by-products declared fit for human consumption to be handled in the same building as by-products not declared fit for human consumption. Instead, there must be clearly separated buildings and clearly separated transport containers. By-products approved as food and by-products not approved as food must not, for example, be dealt with in the same building. Rather, there must be clearly separated buildings and clearly separated transport containers. We have, in actual fact, also succeeded in arranging for all by-products not declared fit for human consumption to be indelibly colour-labelled and, when it becomes technically possible, identified by smell, too. That has been put in place in order to protect our European farmers, for it is impossible to look at a sack of ready-processed feed and see where the protein or fat comes from. It will now no longer be possible, however, to deceive farmers when they feed their animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I must be allowed to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all those alongside whom I have been working within Parliament. It has been both enjoyable and inspiring. We have quarrelled, engaged in discussion and reached agreement. There has been a very good atmosphere and good group debates. I would also thank the Commission and, in particular, Mr Colombo for the helpful and intensive technical cooperation offered. I also wish to thank the Council of Minister’s working party and those involved in the Swedish, Belgian, Spanish and, now, Danish presidencies. We have all cooperated and we have done some very good work. I therefore recommend that we unanimously accept the offer of conciliation when we vote tomorrow. It is important that this work now be concluded. The by-products industry employs tens of thousands of people around Europe, mainly in rural districts. It is crucial that its managers now set about the business of investment and conversion and that they be given the opportunity to maintain what is, for us all, a very good industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE and other serious animal diseases. The first component was the regulation on TSEs adopted last year.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is very important – it is essential for the safe collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and disposal of the millions of tonnes of animal by-products produced in the Union every year. The continued absence of a sound comprehensive regulatory framework to deal with these by-products would be a very dangerous thing indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express the Commission’s sincere thanks to Mrs Paulsen, for her enormous efforts and tireless work, over nearly two years, in pursuing an agreement between the Commission and the Council on the proposed regulation. The position we have reached here today owes much to her personal commitment, tenacity and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank, in particular, Mrs Caroline Jackson, chairperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and Mr Joseph Daul, chairperson of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their valuable input.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on four key principles. Firstly, that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Secondly, that intra-species recycling – known as 'cannibalism' – should be banned. Thirdly, that certain provisions should be tightened in order to improve control and traceability in the animal by-products sector. Fourthly, that alternative disposal options should be approved to take into account scientific and technological developments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased that the difficult issue of catering waste has finally been resolved. The solution permits a temporary relaxation of the ban on the use of catering waste in feed for some Member States, under certain highly controlled conditions to be established by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of catering waste in feed constitutes a major threat of transmission of serious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever. It is certain that nobody would wish to see a repeat of the kind of outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease we recently saw in the UK, with its enormous losses to the farming and non-farming community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will now focus on preparing implementing measures – including the approval of alternative disposal methods and a derogation on intra-species recycling for fish and fur animals – as well as a number of transitional measures covering such matters as catering waste and used cooking oil, to bridge the gap prior to the application of the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for the inclusive approach she has given all the other groups during first and second reading and secondly congratulate her on the way she represented Parliament during conciliation, particularly when dealing with some of our friends in the German Green Group, a difficult task at the best of times as I am sure Chancellor Schroeder has found out and will continue to find out.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union produces millions of tonnes of animal by-products and these are separated into three categories according to the risk to humans or animals. Category one, which contains specified risk material, was implicated in the spread of BSE. I am pleased that we also included in category one waste from airlines which may have come from countries that do not have the same standards as we do, although I am sure some people would say that some of the airline food would not be considered fit for human consumption anyway. There is category three, which is fit for human consumption, including catering waste, and category two, which is all the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue at conciliation was that of catering waste and there we had two national problems. In the UK catering waste is banned. It was implicated in the start of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the north-east of England and also in the inquiry into the Classical Swine Fever outbreak in East Anglia, which suggested that the cause might have been a discarded ham sandwich thrown into a field of outdoor pigs. But historically in the UK, we carried out our processing of catering waste on farms – so-called pigswill. This was very hard to control and it is not surprising that there were breakdowns in the way that was done.</p>
<p class="contents">In some ways I wish that we had gone down the same route as the Germans and the Austrians which was not to process this material on farm, but to put in state-of-the-art multi-million pound installations which were run with typical German efficiency. Some of those are brand new and it would be unfair to shut them down at very short notice, particularly when one considers the alternatives as to where this waste would have to go. Maybe it would go into landfill, as much of the catering waste in the UK does, and that would be subject to rodents or seagulls taking part away and distributing it around the countryside. A second possible way of getting rid of it would be using incineration, which is both costly and damaging to the environment. It is very good that we negotiated this transitional period to 1 November 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that in the UK we do not have pigswill. We do, however, recycle waste oil produced from such establishments as fish and chip shops, that monument to the culinary art, but also from other catering establishments and private homes that produce waste cooking oil. In the UK this was a thriving cottage industry. Every week a 25 litre drum was taken away and the chef was given GBP 5, part of the black economy. This was taken away to be processed into animal feed. However, when doubts were expressed about the continued use of this, the collectors started to charge a fee and at that point the chefs made alternative arrangements. That meant it went down the drain. That has resulted in blocked sewers and other environmental problems as congealed fats and oils interfere with the infrastructure below our streets taking away the waste water.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the UK gets an extension to give it time to review the situation, to evaluate the risks of the continued use of cooking oil, although personally I think they are insignificant, and to put in place systems for alternative uses such as biodiesel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the first task of anyone who has served on the Conciliation Committee must be to congratulate Mrs Paulsen for her drive and tenacity in surviving a complex conciliation which was at times almost overturned by some very unorthodox manoeuvres. That would not have been right for Parliament, and I am glad that the various parties to this agreement converged in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Paulsen had to keep her nerve because events elsewhere, including elections, were bringing special pressures to bear on the way in which these events were being looked at. Yet she was vindicated the whole time by the saga of continuing food contamination scandals which went on in a number of Member States right through 2002 and in the way in which this matter has worked out.</p>
<p class="contents">We know all about full traceability for specified risk materials in the United Kingdom because we were forced in the wake of BSE to introduce, almost at gun-point, something which is now going to be uniform across the Community. This is all to the good. I believe that the number of by-products that have found their way into the food chain this year show us that perhaps even now, and later when this regulation is fully enforced, there will still need to be vigilance to ensure that above all else the principle of separation is rigorously upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the questions mentioned already by Mr Goodwill regarding the problem some Member States have experienced. I am glad that we have found a solution which leaves a temporary period of transition, rather than shrugging aside the need to bring this matter to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I make no comment on the situation as regards the Austrian and German industries and confine myself to the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom we had certain specific problems: perhaps the Commissioner can make a note of them, because in the final statement we will need to see how these are addressed in connection with the transition.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question, familiar to Mr Goodwill, is of small incinerators which have been used as an extremely sensible way of destroying fallen stock on site with the minimum period of contamination risk. We need to be sure, during the transition period for inspection, that the reasons why these have been used, and used effectively, are fully understood by the Commission and that they are not simply arbitrarily removed from the scene.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is the question of cooking oil. The United Kingdom is now prepared to accept, rightly, that the transition period should be two years instead of four years and that in that time, given that this whole directive is only going to take effect something like eight or nine months from now, there will have been an adequate period for the industry concerned to adjust its practices – and probably its profits – to other ways of disposing of this, particularly in the field of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am glad the United Kingdom withdrew its objections relating to the application for a transition period for the land application of blood from slaughterhouses. This is a pretty repulsive habit. We could not have justified it and am glad that the United Kingdom withdrew its objections. In this matter, too, the principle of cleanliness and separation should be paramount. Mrs Paulsen has showed us the way and it is up to us to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that this regulation provides a modern version of obsolete legislation on offal. After two years of negotiations, it was very much overdue.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important in this regulation is that dead animals and condemned animal material can no longer be brought into the food chain. The only products which may still be used for the production of animal feed will be material derived from slaughtered animals declared fit for human consumption. Additionally, it is clear that the recycling of animal meal in animal feed is nothing short of cannibalism, and should thus be banned by introducing separate production lines and full traceability. This regulation's implementation should therefore be foolproof, and we have not heard the last of this, of course. Controlling cannibalism will require an important reorganisation of the sector that collects, and disposes of, animal waste. We are aware that there are quite a few tricksters and frauds active in this sector who are involved in very shady practices, and that this matter is highly susceptible to fraud. This will therefore require considerable efforts in the area of inspections on the part of the Member States, as Mr Whitehead rightly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a comment on kitchen and restaurant waste that contains animal products, on which we have reached a respectable compromise. It was not easy, but the compromise is before us, mainly thanks to pressure from our German and Austrian fellow MEPs. I do not want to hide the fact that this issue is very sensitive in my country. All agricultural organisations in Belgium insist on an absolute ban on this practice due to health risks. Minor causes can indeed have grave consequences, as was borne out by the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and African swine fever. Despite this, I can tell you that the majority of my group will eventually be endorsing the texts before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I warmly thank Mrs Paulsen for her commitment and for her staying power during the quest for the workable compromise that we eventually found and which, taking all things into account, we find satisfactory. We also recommend approval of the joint draft.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use the speaking time available to me today to make it abundantly clear that I did not vote for this compromise immediately and with any show of enthusiasm. The reason for this is that there is one item on which we are putting off a decision and entrusting the Commission with a mission the outcome of which is open. I refer, Commissioner, to the recycling of food waste, an issue which I see as being far from being resolved once and for all. The simple fact that something is intended for human consumption but is left over because nobody wants or is able to eat it, is a very long way from making it special category waste, with all the ensuing consequences for its treatment and disposal. Mr Goodwill has indeed referred to the many problems involved in disposal. Food waste, however, also represents valuable nutrients, which, as proved by examples in Germany and Austria, can become good feedingstuffs for animals when turned into swill and collected in accordance with the best organisational, technical and hygienic standards. We are very well aware that food waste can transmit diseases, some of them epidemics, from one animal to another, and that is why it needs the best possible preparation in accordance with the high standards facilitated by technology. That is why a general ban on the use of food waste as feed cannot be justified, as there are no rules on how such remnants should finally be disposed of. When it is cleared away from the table, does the meal on the plate suddenly become special category waste?</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for a general ban on the feeding of food waste to animals only until evidence is supplied that it is properly prepared. This compromise has, then, not finally removed this topic from the agenda. It is now for the Commission to present a proposal on the recycling of food waste by the end of 2004. This is a demand, to which I add the request that the existing options for swill preparation also be taken into account. Some small and medium-sized enterprises, family firms and farms have invested a great deal in this. There must above all be no loophole resulting from the initial enactment of a ban, followed some time later by the handing down of another authorisation, so that time elapses without any decision being taken. Enterprises need guarantees in order to plan ahead. Animal feed in the European Union must be safe and reliable for animals and humans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Vitorino said, the challenge is still how to protect ourselves against BSE. It is as if we have almost forgotten that this was the main problem and that this is what was behind all the directives that we have been adopting recently in the field of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prohibiting the recycling of animal carcasses and condemned animal by-products into the food chain, we are banning animal ‘cannibalism’, this is a positive step. Food traceability has been improved. Lastly, we are preventing cross-contamination. This is all well and good but there is, unfortunately, a down side, because although we have certainly made progress in eliminating food waste, I think that the obligation imposed on Member States is being partly deferred. A transitional period has been proposed which, as previous speakers have said, is too long. Two years was certainly long enough for us to resolve these problems. For example, oils can produce biomass for biofuels etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, some States will be virtuous and take the necessary measures as soon as possible, whilst others will wait until the very last minute, until 2006, by using the comitology procedure. This is a very unpleasant reminder of what happened at the peak of the BSE crisis, when some States claimed not to have any cases of mad cow disease because they were not doing any tests. When they started to carry out the tests, they detected cases of mad cow disease. Yet, these same States today are not, in my view, being particularly reasonable. We must speed up the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am committed to retaining the use of food waste as feed under appropriately strict conditions. Let me make it clear that we are talking here about dishes officially permitted for human consumption. Let those listening to me understand that, to take a couple of examples, this is about unsaleable bread that will no longer be fresh the following day, about left-over pieces of cake and that sort of thing. The prevention of disease is adequately taken care of by the heating of food waste in the manner prescribed, which furthermore facilitates proper recycling of such remnants and thereby acts as a deterrent against even more ‘rubbish tourism’. Moreover, it provides pigs with a first-rate supply of essential amino and fatty acids, and makes it possible to reduce the importation of feedingstuffs. It is a fact that liquid feed, that is, swill, derived from food waste, is known to have relatively few negative effects on rearing pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to guarantee an appropriate standard of sterilisation in order to kill off pathogens. The outcome of the conciliation procedure, with the seven amendments, was indeed accepted by the Council without further ado, and, on the extremely important Amendment No 25, which embodies a comprehensive compromise, I welcome the Council's draft providing for transitional measures under stringently monitored conditions for at most four years from 1 November 2002 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Any firm undertaking by the Commission to develop a directive on biowaste including kitchen and food waste, by the end of 2004, must primarily aim to stipulate safe use, recovery and reuse. Contamination has to be monitored, and we welcome this approach. It is the firms that have invested a great deal of money in these measures in order to meet the very highest standards, and are officially monitored, that are the best guarantee of food waste for feed being harmlessly removed and processed under controlled conditions. As has already been pointed out by those who spoke before me, we could give a whole catalogue of examples to demonstrate that no adequate guarantee can be provided by a general ban on feeding this sort of stuff to animals. What becomes of it then? The future should find us still not destroying this valuable feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in conclusion that, on this issue, I am myself a strong advocate of a regulation rather than a directive, because I can already see how these things will be transposed differently in different countries, because I have an inkling that competition will be distorted, and because, if something is wrong, then it is wrong everywhere, be it in Germany, in Austria, or in any other Member State in this internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outcome is a respectable one. I believe that what have before us is a good regulation, one that meets Parliament's requirements arising from the committee of inquiry into BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reason why this is important is that we are not just talking about feeding methods or about the authorisation of feed subject to certain conditions; it is also being made clear what happens to those things that cannot be used in feed. Rules are therefore laid down on destruction. That is what we must also achieve when it comes to the area of food waste. A simple prohibition will not suffice, as it is not known what will then become of the stuff. As I have always said, you can't just chuck the stuff in a ditch. It is precisely then that it becomes hazardous, when, unsterilised and unmonitored, it can find its way to animals, possibly leading to the spreading of plague and foot and mouth disease. But not if it is sterilised.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad the Commission has acceded to this proposal and said that it will, by 2004, present a directive – and yes, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I too think it should be a regulation – on biowaste, in which it will lay down rules on all the possible uses of food waste, including its use as feed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the compromise we reached has not been minuted. As it will be the next Parliament that will have to negotiate about it – and things are forgotten very quickly – I will be distributing a note for the records which you can have a look at. We may be able to sign it, and then give this a permanent place as what we want as regards the handling of this issue in the next Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
