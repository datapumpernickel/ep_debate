It is a question of working together so that we can properly prepare the ground for future actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has placed the effective implementation of its policies at the heart of its objectives, but if we are to implement them effectively we need a genuine partnership between the European institutions. The 2005 report shows that the caricature of a Europe in the grip of paralysis was far removed from reality. We have in actual fact made considerable progress. The Commission has focused on its objectives and has achieved a rate of implementation of nearly 90% for its priority actions. The Stability and Growth Pact, the revised social agenda and the sustainable development strategy have been steered in a new direction. Above all, however, I believe that, this week, we will see that the revision of the Lisbon Strategy on employment and growth has been a turning point in terms of finally providing the strategy with the tools it needs to turn aspirations into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hampton Court Summit helped achieve a new consensus on the key elements of the Union’s action in a world that is heading in the direction of globalisation. It opened the door to the measures that are emerging today. I am thinking, for instance, of European energy policy and of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union demonstrated its ability to respond rapidly to people’s needs after the tsunami and the London bombings. It has also shown that it is capable of working as one body, with the European consensus on development, to which the European Parliament itself also subscribes, being the expression of a genuine common approach. Admittedly, our task is not complete. As far as the financial perspective is concerned, however, I believe that we are closer than ever to reaching an agreement. If we find a solution very soon, then we will still have enough time to get under way with implementing most of the programmes at the start of next year, something that is particularly important for the less wealthy countries and regions of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future of the European debate, we can still take advantage of the events and make use of that period in order to find a genuine consensus regarding which direction we need to take. I believe that we are on the right track: the annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, the Green Paper on energy policy, biofuels, the European Institute of Technology and the road map in the field of gender equality are so many major initiatives that are already on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what about 2007?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that 2007 will be a crucial year in terms of achieving the strategic objectives set by our Commission for its term of office. Our strategic objectives over five years – prosperity, solidarity and security – and, of course, their influence outside the EU remain fully relevant. They form a coherent political framework designed to guide the action of the European Union. They reflect the challenges facing Europe and the main anxieties of Europeans, which they strive to address. They will remain the cornerstone of the Commission’s action. I believe in fact that they constitute a sound basis from which to re-assess the direction that our Union must take. With the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome coming up in 2007, attention will rightly be focused on the great values and the general objectives of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The main target must continue to be sustainable growth to provide more and better jobs in Europe. With a more positive macroeconomic outlook, we must seize every opportunity to accelerate reforms and put them into practice. I know that this Parliament is committed to playing its role in a real partnership for growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007, several Member States should be speeding up their preparations for adopting the euro. Provided they meet the necessary conditions, in 2007 we shall see the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and I look forward to their contribution to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy will continue to attract our attention. We will pay special attention to the promotion of sustainable management and the protection of natural resources. We will make proposals for a European Union maritime policy. We will follow up on the Green Paper on labour law. The year 2007 will also be the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. In the field of security and freedom, the main target will be the extension of the Schengen area, migration and border controls and the fight against crime. Health issues will remain central, with greater preventive efforts against pandemics. Beyond our borders, we will ensure a proper follow-up to the Doha Round, progress in the stabilisation of the western Balkans – in particular in Kosovo – and completion of partnership agreements with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, we will be very busy in 2007. The year 2007 will also see new directions for the second half of the Commission’s mandate. We shall be preparing for the future, with intensive work on the comprehensive review of the Union’s budget leading to a White Paper in 2008-2009. This review needs to be based on a profound reflection and must take the full range of views into account. This will naturally include the European Parliament and I welcome your intention of close association with this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say a few words on our ability to deliver on these priorities. We need to translate them into practical actions and implement them through the most appropriate instruments. The Commission has made progress in this direction. Firstly, we have a strategic planning and programming cycle ensuring an effective and timely delivery of our priorities and concentrating our resources on these tasks. The Commission states its intentions, consults on them, adopts its work programme and reports regularly on its implementation. However, we need to further strengthen the political relevance and substance of our discussion on our strategic planning and programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have implemented a range of instruments to promote better regulation and good governance, which I believe is having a real impact on the rigour of our work and the quality of our output. We have made significant efforts to carry out impact assessments on our major proposals. We have completed more than one hundred so far, and we will continue to improve their quality and ensure that they make a real difference in our decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also carry through its simplification agenda, covering various fields from environment to industry, the modernisation of labour law, the promotion of consumer rights or key internal market sectors. However, let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States. As I have said before, better regulation is crucially important for liberalising our economic potential, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. What our business needs in Europe is a red carpet, not red tape. Efforts must be pursued at all levels to show that European initiatives are well founded and add real value. In many areas – be it at European or national level – we do not need so many regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As Montesquieu said – in the best possible way – and I shall say it in French: </p>
<p class="contents">‘<span class="italic">Les lois inutiles affaiblissent les lois nécessaires</span>’. </p>
<p class="contents">Roughly translated, that means ‘useless laws weaken indispensable ones’. This is the very principle of the good European tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the next steps? The annual policy strategy decision forms the basis for our dialogue in view of preparing the Commission’s work programme for 2007. Every Commissioner now stands ready to discuss with committees the political priorities put forward in her or his area. It is crucial to take time away from the topic of the day in order to prepare for the future. I very much welcomed Parliament’s initiative last year to draw together the threads in its report. That had a real impact on this year’s work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable members, the Commission puts this strategy forward in a spirit of partnership. I look forward to your views on where Europe should devote its energies in 2007.</p>

<p class="contents">The political strategy for 2007 must enable us to provide sound answers. Without either the interinstitutional agreement or the financial perspective for the moment, where do we go from here? We are in a situation that I would describe as complete hypocrisy. We want to debate actions that are important for Europeans, while, for its part, the Council, ever deaf to our arguments, is proposing practically no budgetary development. Our Parliament will not give up on the financial perspective. The needs are huge: youth training, research, transport, health programmes, the environment; a full list would be too long. Mr Barroso, you talk to us about a potential forthcoming agreement, but I have not heard you say the word ‘ambitious’ – an ambitious agreement – and I therefore remain sceptical.</p>
<p class="contents">In the dialogue that we are embarking upon, you can count on the momentum of our Assembly in formulating its political priorities for 2007. I am pleased, moreover, to see that the European Commission is finally recognising that economic cohesion, solidarity and environmental protection can be reconciled with our objectives regarding growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">You propose four priority areas: knowledge, businesses – and specifically SMEs – employment and ageing and, lastly, energy. We must in fact represent the best of the knowledge-based society. We can see what is happening in Asia and we must not remain helpless in the face of it. The European Union will only cope if it rises to the challenge posed by knowledge, knowledge that takes the form of technical and industrial developments. As regards SMEs, we must create a competitive regulatory environment and help our businesses to gain a better foothold in international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">You also intend to do away with the European laws that serve no purpose, those notorious useless laws that you just mentioned to us, which weaken the necessary laws. We totally agree with you, Mr Barroso, and our Parliament plans to be closely involved in the decisions taken to simplify legislation. Being simple, however, also means expressing oneself clearly. You want to make 2007 an important year where communication is concerned, and I approve of your ambition. Coining new words, however, has never been part of a good communication strategy. In the context of the main priority, that of employment, you introduce an awful word, ‘flexisecurity’. What does that mean? Europeans are going to run away faced with that highly technocratic word. ‘Brussels has invented yet another forgettable word’ – that is what we are in danger of hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy is the fundamental issue. The year 2007 will have to be a decisive one where the guidelines on energy policy are concerned. We will have to be objective, disregard all ideologies, no longer treat nuclear power as a taboo subject and keep in mind that our energy dependence must never exceed 50%. As we have seen recently, energy is becoming a genuine weapon with which to exert political pressure. Furthermore, if, in the future, a non-EU country decides to cut the supply and plunge Europe into darkness, how will we respond? We therefore need to improve the means of transporting energy and to think, first and foremost, about solidarity among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of security and freedoms, the extension of the Schengen area worries our fellow citizens. They still have the impression that our borders remain porous and that the debate on immigration is still at the stage of wishful thinking. The future enlargement to incorporate Romania and Bulgaria will have to be decided in the course of this year. While I am on that subject, we note with interest your indispensable condition: that those countries will have to comply in full with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire.</span> Moreover, if the neighbourhood policy becomes a policy in its own right, then I regret that more is not being done in terms of establishing the strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2007-2013 period will also mark the launch of new European programmes. There will be a large number of them, and, if we are to launch them, then we need the financial perspective. We are only too familiar with the debate on Erasmus. Finally, we will pay a great deal of attention to the preparation of your White Paper on the reform of the EU budget. We ask you to involve our Parliament in this task.</p>

That is what I want to speak about.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in broad agreement, Mr Barroso, about the content of what you have said and what you have presented in writing. A revised Lisbon Strategy? Of course! Defining Europe’s role in the globalised world as regards migration? Fine! A key challenge! Improving Europe’s energy supply, greater energy efficiency, greater energy security? Unity throughout the House! Promoting technology, investing in the technologies of the future to preserve and enhance Europe’s global competitiveness as a knowledge-based continent? Agreed! Strengthening internal security and expanding Europe’s role in international security? Agreed! Wonderful! Great! We will hear many more speakers today saying, ‘this is just what we need! Mr Barroso is right, that is the way forward!’</p>
<p class="contents">What we have not been given, however, is a Financial Perspective to match, that is the necessary resources to achieve that. We haggle with the Council – Mrs Grossetête is right there – for a billion more or less. The bold approach which you and your Commissioners pushed for when presenting your Financial Perspective, Mr Barroso, was cut by EUR 200 billion in the European Council. You asked for EUR 1 022 billion for seven years, the Council decided on EUR 840 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I wondered what happened to Mr Barroso’s strategic outcry against such incorrect financial policy. You told this Parliament you would fight for these strategic objectives with this financial allocation. And then you told Parliament the Council’s decision was a success. There is nothing else you can do, I understand that, because you will not get any more money, at least not unless we fight a bit more for it. As Commission President, you have to live with the stupidity of the Heads of State or Government. My criticism is therefore directed not so much at you and your Commission as at the partners on the other side.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not achieve these strategic objectives if we define the objectives without making the necessary resources available to the institutions that have to act. That is certain! That is why I am saying that the Commission’s strategic objectives are the right ones, but you must also argue the matter with the individual States! As President of the Commission you must call a spade a spade! In every single case, you and your Commissioners must go and say that we cannot announce we are going to give Europol more power, that we can fight terrorism and crime more efficiently at European level – incidentally, the joint fight against crime and greater internal security are the European matters getting the highest rate of approval from Europe’s citizens – and then have the Council cut the appropriations by EUR 7.8 billion – and that three days before adopting the additional programme for Europol that sounds so good in the newspaper.</p>
<p class="contents">Your strategic objectives are the right ones. But the Commission must take up the cudgels with those Heads of State or Government, with those ministers and councils of ministers, that are not willing to pay the price on Monday for the speeches they made on Sunday. I expect the Commission to do that. You can expect us to support your strategic objectives – you have named the right strategic objectives – but we expect you to stand at our side in our battle, as Parliament, with the Heads of State or Government for a little more credibility for European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we agree this together for 2007, it will be an exciting year and I am sure a successful one for the European institutions.</p>

<p class="contents">We have before us a blueprint for the future with its emphasis on knowledge, enterprise, jobs and energy. The 2007 Annual Policy Strategy succeeds in putting flesh on the bones of the Hampton Court proposals, which could help make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world, if Member States would only move beyond the platitudes dished up at the annual Lisbon Spring Council. I have seen the draft Council conclusions. Fine words from such faint hearts! Europe deserves better. It deserves the shared responsibility of which Mr Barroso spoke. That is why Liberals and Democrats welcome the ambition displayed by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This paper promises what previous annual policy strategies manifestly failed to provide: practical proposals for European renewal by creating legal migration channels and a common European asylum system – and their corollary of better border management – to provide the workers and security that Europe needs; by fast-tracking a European energy policy; completing the internal market for energy and gas; investing in clean coal technologies; and balancing flexibility and social protection with the demands of markets to boost growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that the Commission has not learned. It puts the use of resources and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity. It should put them under the heading of prosperity, because until we learn that the environment and green growth is part of prosperity rather than solidarity, we will not have the correct perspective on such matters. Add to these the enlargement of the eurozone and the welcoming of Bulgaria and Romania, and 2007 could be a seminal year for Europe, particularly if we get the constitutional process back on track.</p>
<p class="contents">However, success hinges on a factor that has been absent up to now, and cannot be replaced by any number of Commission proposals: national ownership of necessary reforms by Member States. Who will trust leadership which says one thing and does another; which agrees policies, but then backtracks, disrupts and weakens their implementation? I refer not only to attacks on the services or takeovers directives from economic protectionists, I am talking about a more general myopia that prevents Member States from seeing the bigger picture; the myopia which prompted the Council to throw out proposals to name and shame poorly performing countries and refuse adequate funding for Europe’s priority areas. It is also one reason why the ambitions of last year’s annual policy strategy to make progress on Doha, on the Lisbon goals and on the Constitution came famously unstuck.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is the challenge facing Europe’s leaders when they convene for tomorrow’s Spring Council. Europe needs them to construct a coalition of the coherent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monica Frassoni, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – (IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing another strategy, another paper and another set of priorities; in the same way in which we debated the others, we would like to place the emphasis on two or three issues – firstly on the agreement concerning the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you know very well that coming to an agreement now, today, with the Council would mean a dramatic reduction in our ambitions and, naturally, those of citizens. We therefore call on you to make an agreement and to work for an agreement, but subject to our conditions, which ought also to be yours. I fully agree with the agreement on the financial perspectives, but not subject to the Council’s conditions. Until we can count on agreement and a clear alliance with the Commission on this point, debates like today’s will remain somewhat devoid of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you mentioned other topics and I would like to refer to two in particular: one is the issue of immigration and internal security. You said that the priorities will be Schengen, controls and borders, but you said nothing about one point although it is mentioned in the text: the problem is an aspect that we consider a priority, which is legal immigration procedures. This element is present in your texts, but it is absent from what is done and what is said! The fact that the Commission is not able to say one word – not even one – on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country, Italy, still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament, which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert, means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words. We would be delighted to hear just one word from you on this subject that is not merely a general remark.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of energy. We have a problem; you are aware that there are differences of opinion on this matter, and particularly that in our view nuclear energy and renewable energy cannot be placed on the same footing – they are two different things. We acknowledge the fact that there is nuclear energy on this continent, but we cannot believe that this is an energy of the future for our continent, partly because – and this is not a minor consideration – we still have to import uranium, whereas we do not have to import sun or wind! This is an important point, at least from a conceptual point of view, and nuclear power should not be placed on the same footing! We have to understand, very clearly and very specifically, that we cannot depend on nuclear power. Nuclear power today meets only a part of our requirements and it is certainly not an option for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, on energy issues, there is still a gaping hole in the Commission’s strategy: its silence on the transport question. Seventy per cent of our dependence on oil relates to transport. Even in this Parliament we have not been able to help very much, I agree, with regard to an innovative transport policy, but I believe that the Commission ought to help us on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, by saying that there is another priority which is being ignored in this area, and that is our cities. Cities are an opportunity not only as a kind of laboratory but also for Europe’s use, and currently insufficient use is being made of them both from the viewpoint of financial support and from the viewpoint of major strategies. Perhaps it is better to start with cities rather than with major infrastructure, which in any case will not be financed by Europe either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for us to become witnesses every day to the tempestuous concern and protests which have been stirred up by the new anti-grass roots employment laws in France; we have frequently become witnesses recently of citizens' reactions to various directives. It is unacceptable when the Union buries its head in the sand by following through on policies which promote benefits not for the workers but for large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is following through on the Lisbon Strategy which, in a bid to disorientate the workers, is now allegedly a 'reformed' strategy. Has it perhaps been reformed or changed in substance since when it was first decided or has it managed to promote the development of a social policy agenda designed to safeguard basic social standards, quality employment and the reconciliation of work and private life? No, it has not.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of competitiveness, workers rights are on the receiving end every day of the fire of capitalist Europe. Working times are being extended, wages are being cut, collective agreements are being abolished, unemployment and unequal pay are increasing and the welfare regime is being swept away completely. The first to suffer are young people, the people on whom we are calling – and that is the irony – to build a Europe with a future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, policies are being promoted which allegedly oil the wheels of immigration. How can that be, when their objective is once again the criteria laid down to safeguard the economic interests of Europe, when immigrants and people who need international protection are being kept on European territory under conditions of detention when their only crime has been to seek a humane life?</p>
<p class="contents">European resources should be used not to finance policies to strengthen closed borders, deportations and repatriations, but to remedy the real causes of immigration and to promote human rights in a substantial manner within the framework of a mutually beneficial neighbourhood policy, far from the philosophy of the reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the World Bank and from the philosophy of military intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Action by the Commission ought to cover all spheres, and at the same time it should choose as its priorities those initiatives that are important not only in one specific sector but also for the overall development of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s programme, the launching of the space programme and the regular evaluation of strategy were among the most important measures mentioned for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in 2007. While not contesting the importance of these measures, I believe that specific measures to foster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the services sector would offer broader support to the Lisbon process, but such measures were not included in the list. Although the development of small and medium-sized enterprises appears among the priorities listed, this priority is not reflected at all in the list of principal actions. It is the development of this sector, however, that can actually make the most rapid contribution to achieving the goals of employment and growth. Although the development of the services sector is and remains one of the main instruments for implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the Commission’s strategy for 2007, no specific measures for the development of the services sector are mentioned. We hope that it was not as a result of a deliberate move, but of a failure to coordinate the strategy established with operational measures, that the reform of the services sector was not included in the Commission’s policy strategy for 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the Services Directive in 2007 will also clear the way for new initiatives by the European Commission in sectors that have been identified for liberalisation of services. The creation of one-stop agencies would be one specific move in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">2007 will be decisive for debates about the future of the European Union. One of the main criteria according to which the European public will judge the European Union’s viability and future prospects in 2007 will be the concrete results of action taken by the European Union’s institutions, including the Commission. This specificity ought, however, to be already apparent in the setting out of priorities and tasks, by defining the measures planned for 2007 not only in terms of continuing work already begun but also in terms of achieving concrete results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As yet, we have received details of only a small selection of the laws and regulations produced by the Commission. We have not been given precise information about the legal bases, so we cannot see whether the Commission is proposing voluntary coordination or binding rules. It is difficult to debate strategic guidelines in the dark. Does the Commission want more power, centralism and Byzantine regulation, or does it want to inspire the Member States to pull together in the interests of job creation and to encourage countries to compete in doing things as best they can?</p>
<p class="contents">The Independence and Democracy Group wants greater freedom for the Member States and less power centralised in Brussels. The Commission must be open with people. Tell us who is giving good advice in your 3 000 secret working parties. Let us see what is behind the advice. Tell us how you use taxpayers’ money. Give the EU’s auditors, the ombudsman and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control full access to investigate all expenditure.

Give us the information we request, unless there is, exceptionally, a sound argument for excluding public discussion.</p>

This should serve as a warning to us politicians that we are paying insufficient attention to our citizens. The European Union has not yet managed to become unified following its most recent enlargement to include 10 new Member States, and yet it is already preparing for the future accession of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2007 could be a year of opportunity in terms of achieving a more unified Europe that demonstrates more solidarity if the old Member States open up towards the new Member States, particularly as regards liberalising their labour markets. Unfortunately there appear to be few countries with the courage of Spain and Portugal, which know from their own recent experience how difficult it is to be a second-class citizen in the European Union. I propose that any future enlargement of the European Union should either be full, or that it should not happen at all. I hope that in saying this I am also reflecting the will of the people of the Netherlands and France. It is not yet too late to deepen European unity by ensuring that it has a budget that lives up to its ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">2006 has drawn the attention of Europeans to the problem of energy supplies. Today more than ever, Europe needs a common energy policy. This would provide a good opportunity to improve the prospects of farmers, particularly in the new Member States, who could become involved in biofuel production.</p>
<p class="contents">The worldwide process of globalisation is inevitable. Europe should regard it as a new challenge and as a development opportunity. It is our duty to help developing countries, but also to enhance our European social model and to care for those of our citizens who are least able to look after themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome them both in respect of the procedural issues and their content.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of procedural issues, I am pleased about the initiative that had already started last year as a result of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the European Commission, ensuring that the European Parliament, including its committees, will have a greater involvement and opportunity to participate in the drafting of the annual policy strategy and legislation programme. I hope that the difficulties experienced last year will be eliminated this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of the document submitted by the Commission, too, has undergone a significant change compared to previous years, and it points in the right direction. Paradoxically, we could also say that the fact that the document does not contain budgetary specifications due to the absence of financial perspectives has had a positive effect on it, as it enabled a better concentration on the political goals and tasks facing the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should not forget the context in which this plan has been created, either. Over the past years, we have felt on several occasions that Europe is not moving forward, but backwards, and it does not take necessary steps. In the course of last year, we managed to take a few tentative first steps in the right direction, but we have a huge number of unfinished projects. Let us have a look at them, one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">One such project is the Constitution, which I think we need to complete as soon as possible. If we want to avoid a European Parliament full of Euro-sceptic groups, we should make sure that the Constitution is routed in the right direction before the start of the European Parliament elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have a financial perspective, either. Therefore, the goals that are correctly formulated in this seven-year budget are not in place and do not have a firm foundation at the present time. We have made a correct step in the right direction in this respect, too, but we, here in Parliament, are not currently satisfied with the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about 2007, we also talk about enlargement, because Romania and Bulgaria will most likely become Member States of the European Union by then. While we feel that the tensions that had arisen in the European Union in relation with the last enlargement, due to a decrease in solidarity, are still unresolved, let us step into year 2007 in such a way that we work on the tensions that had come into existence in the course of the last enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, competitiveness is one of your important themes, it is one of our important themes! I nevertheless see many citizens who believe it has nothing to do with them, that it is a matter only for industry, for big business. No, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social system in Europe, without greater competitiveness we will be unable to maintain the social model of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is much the same with education. Education is not something of interest only to an elite. Education must reach broad sections of the population if we want to achieve one of Europe’s essential objectives, namely to prevent the exclusion of people or groups. Education is especially important, too, when we consider that we are <span class="italic">de facto</span> a continent of immigration. It is most important for the integration of new immigrant citizens that we develop the education sector accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the Globalisation Fund you mention is concerned, we will in fact only be able to finance it if we also increase our competitiveness so that we do not risk having to call on this Globalisation Fund too often.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example I would like to take, because you place a great deal of emphasis on it in your paper, is energy policy. I do not want to anticipate what the Members who will speak after me will have to say, but one important subject that you touched on is security of energy supply. I am very pleased that you visited Moscow recently and – from what I have heard – not without success, even though it is in many respects still up to Russia to take decisions, on the Energy Charter in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have also heard that you have said we should also talk about nuclear energy. You are right and I am very pleased that we shall be hearing from the Commissioner responsible for energy shortly. Although I am sceptical about nuclear energy, we must still talk about it, and also about the risks it entails. If we are discussing proliferation these days in connection with Iran, then more nuclear energy also means more dangers unless we ensure, jointly and multilaterally, that the associated risks are minimised as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think more ought to be said about this subject in particular, both by you and in the Green Paper. That is particularly the case, too, for infrastructure development. Because without more infrastructure – pipelines in particular, but in other areas as well – we will never be able to give this continent energy security and we will not give Europe the corresponding new technological boost. I fully support you on that. I wish you more strength and courage, however, in putting these decisions into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned Montesquieu, and someone else wanted Machiavelli. I wish you the wisdom of a Montesquieu, but also the strength and cunning of a Machiavelli, to get your programme through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no clues. A policy strategy that fails to address the principal political blockage in front of the Union should be assessed fairly critically. Without the Constitution, the Union will fail to have the capacity to act to fulfil the Commission’s ambitions for it. Public opinion will remain sceptical about the European project and, without the support of public opinion, the Commission will lack the necessary clout inside the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The classical function of the Commission would be to broker an agreement between the warring partners in a crisis. I hope that Mr Barroso, when he addresses the parliamentary forum on 9 May, will be able to lay out a comprehensive Commission strategy towards finding a way out of the crisis. For all the value we find in Plan D, the best way to boost trust through action will be to salvage the Constitution. Perhaps it is now time for Plan B. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is not one, not one European citizen who this year will be better off financially than last year. Factories are leaving Europe for other countries. Women buy handbags with French labels which are made in Morocco. Your leather jacket is by a European designer, but it was made in Turkey. What does this mean? It means increased unemployment. It means increased redundancies. It means that we are all becoming hostages to industry, which imposes policies like those in France, a policy which you did not rebut. It therefore means a worse life. It means increased prices. Nothing of all that you have in mind can be creative unless we get off the hook of the Maastricht indicators.

Starting in May 2007, when Portugal will probably have the Council Presidency, history is once again offering you a historic open window for the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, I am talking about Mr Duff’s Plan B and a lot more besides. You will have another chance to fit this European thing we have in front of us together in a meaningful way. I mean the very big thing. You may be able to lift it and go down in history with it, or you may fail completely. But please look now at the contributions that are really being made to the debate on the Constitution and the positioning of the European Union. Try to get out of the old thought patterns that got us into all these problems. Look across the wide ocean! Think a little like Vasco da Gama – and I am not talking only about Chindia – and then fit it together so that we can really take advantage of this historic opportunity, which will present itself again, before the European project simply falls flat or implodes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am curious to see what you will be able to say to us after May 2007.

We have 62 priorities in this splendid new document. I also see that we have now proceeded from ‘moving up a gear’ to ‘boosting trust through action’. I am not sure whether Mrs Wallström is still there, and I do not know whether she is responsible for inventing these wonderful phrases, but we need a much more structured and practical strategy approach from the Commission than these gimmicky words.</p>
<p class="contents">I also observe in here, Mr Barroso, that you are going to ‘take delivery up to cruising speed’! Well frankly, that means that at the moment things are proceeding at a walking pace. We want some take-off from the Commission, not just cruising along. The problem with your strategy is not that we are short of new ideas or new initiatives, but we are actually short of real delivery of the policies that are going to create the jobs and growth of which you are so fond. Where is there a sense in here that you are putting some real resources and priorities into sorting out the problems of the internal market? There is a little paragraph in here that you are going to streamline the regulatory approach, that is great, but where is it in your priority actions?</p>
<p class="contents">You used a great phrase – and I applaud you for it – about putting out the red carpet for small enterprises. There is not one single priority action, President Barroso, that mentions small enterprises. So, it is very welcome that we are having a debate about this, but we need better-quality material; we need material that is much more focused on real strategy and resource utilisation, rather than on these gimmicky words that Mrs Wallström appears to be giving you. We want something with a real sense that you are putting priorities on delivering the real foundations of the European Union and making the internal market work better, and not just coming out with a whole set of uncosted priorities that look good on paper but in respect of which there is no idea as to whether they are really going to work in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can now be said that the 2004 enlargement has been a great success for Europe, from a political, security, economic and social point of view, and I am sure that 2007 will see that success continue. In 2007, the first new Member States are set to enter the euro zone. In this regard, I should like to challenge the Commission to be proactive in helping those countries to prepare for the arrival of the euro, and strictly to monitor compliance with entry requirements, the so-called Maastricht criteria. I am convinced that meeting the criteria, whether of Maastricht or of the Stability and Growth Pact, is crucial to preserving the political, financial and community credibility of the single European currency.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007, the new Member States of Central and Eastern Europe will also become part of the enlarged Schengen area. The scrapping of internal border controls between Member States, enabling genuine freedom of movement within the Union should under no circumstances mean enabling freedom of movement for all manner of criminality, illegal migration, and so forth. The fight against crime and violence in Europe, along with the launch of the second generation of the Schengen system should, to my mind, form part of the EU's clear and practical priorities for 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, 2007 should also be the year of the next enlargement, with the accession to the Union of Romania and Bulgaria. In this regard, I should like to call on the Commission to help these two countries to prepare for accession and to ensure that they fulfil their entry requirements in every respect. Romania and Bulgaria must be as properly prepared for accession as were the 10 accession countries in 2004. I believe that this is extremely important for the credibility of future enlargements and if the European public is to accept this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not expect the sitting to carry on as late as it has, following the first part of proceedings in the Chamber before the beginning of this item on the agenda. Come what may, the Commission will be present until the end of the debate. I will still be able to answer some of the questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to express my gratitude for the comments, which were for the most part in favour of our programme. There is obviously the underlying question of the financial perspective, which I shall discuss in a moment. In general, however, I feel I can say that the Commission's objectives for 2007 have been received positively.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, Mr Watson asked why we put objectives relating to energy conservation and environmental protection under the heading of solidarity and not that of prosperity. Of course, they could and should come under the heading of prosperity, but we put them under solidarity in order to highlight their enormous importance, given that the term ‘solidarity’ refers to solidarity with future generations. The struggle for a clean environment and for sustainable development is of direct relevance to our future as a whole. This was what led us to put environmental issues under the heading of solidarity, in terms of presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards immigration, Mrs Frassoni said that we have never given our opinion on the issue of illegal immigration and the tragedy of the many Africans who die in the Mediterranean. I am sorry, but this is not true. There have been a number of clear Commission positions on this issue, expressed by Mr Frattini, and the truth of the matter is that we are fighting to achieve a joint approach, where possible, among the Member States on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Frassoni also asked about the absence of any mention of transport in the context of energy policy. I am sorry, but the Green Paper says that we have proposed the following possible actions to the Member States, and I quote, from page 11 of the English text: </p>
<p class="contents">‘a major effort to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector, and in particular to improve rapidly urban public transport in Europe’s major cities’</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Of course this is only a Green Paper, for consultation purposes, but that line is there. When it comes to energy efficiency, we feel that the transport sector is crucial. Let no one be in any doubt about this.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the honourable Members mentioned the opening up of labour markets in Europe. You know that the Commission is in favour of this. On the back of our report, a number of Member States – not only those mentioned, namely Portugal and Spain, but also Finland and the Dutch Government – have announced their intention to promote the liberalisation of the labour markets in Europe at the earliest opportunity. This is moreover the case in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. I gather that others are also considering facilitating the free movement of workers in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda asked how this can be better explained to our citizens, or, in other words, what we can do to explain Europe’s added value, which is a very important question. This is easier on some issues than others. Today, in fact, we announced a very important measure, the air safety ‘blacklist’, which is the first piece of legislation adopted by this Commission, with the support of Parliament and the Council. This is an issue on which the advantages of Community-level action are abundantly clear to the citizens. On issues such as these, we need to go the extra mile to provide explanations and argue our point of view. This is indeed the Commission’s job, but I should like to add, if I may, that all of us are responsible for doing this: it is also the responsibility of Parliament, the honourable Members, national parliaments, of all those who have Europe’s interests at heart and those who feel the necessity to explain the added value that Europe brings.</p>
<p class="contents">On the nuclear issue, Mr Swoboda, our position is very clear: we respect the subsidiarity principle. This is a tough question in Europe; there are Member States in favour and others against. The way forward, as far as I am concerned, is not to avoid debate. Mr Swoboda mentioned my meeting with President Putin. I wish to tell you that, despite Russia's wealth of natural oil and gas resources, President Putin has stated that one of Russia’s main priorities in the future is to develop nuclear energy. This is therefore an issue that we cannot avoid; it is an issue that is on the agenda and that must be discussed frankly. The Commission is not taking sides in the nuclear energy debate. What we are promoting is the principle whereby each Member State finds forms of long-term, sustainable energy in its energy ‘mix’, whilst ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duff and others raised the question of the Constitution. This is not what we are discussing here today, but I should like to confirm that the Commission remains devoted to the principles and the values enshrined in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and we are working on this issue. We are thinking of bringing some ideas on the future of the European debate to the June European Council. Hopefully these ideas will make a worthwhile contribution. Although the Constitutional Treaty, as the name suggests, is an intergovernmental Treaty, the Commission is committed to honouring its responsibilities and will thus want to make its own contribution to this period of reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if it will be a contribution to rival the explorations made by Vasco da Gama in terms of ambition, as suggested by Mr Martin, but in any case it will be our contribution. In any event, I was happy today to hear Montesquieu, Machiavelli and Vasco da Gama mentioned in our debate, which shows that the level of debate in Parliament is moving ever upward. </p>
<p class="contents">And now I shall make some comments in English – I always speak in English when I speak about money! I got used to it during the British Presidency. So, now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">My understanding is that real progress was made yesterday between the institutions. On the basis of compromise texts presented by the Commission, a third trialogue took place yesterday afternoon with the Austrian Presidency, the negotiating team from Parliament and the Commission. Our understanding is that the outcome of the meeting was largely positive. On the interinstitutional agreement itself, there is almost full agreement, including on the idea of adding a new Part Three on sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject to final technical verifications, texts have been agreed on important points such as the Financial Regulation, certification by Member States and the review clause. When I say ‘agreed’, I mean agreed between the delegations. They are agreements <span class="italic">ad referendum</span>. All these points have been considered key elements in various resolutions adopted by Parliament. I am pleased to see that the three institutions have been able to reach consensus on them and I am proud of the contribution that the Commission made to that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards figures, Parliament and the Council have exchanged their views and evaluations based on the ceilings agreed at the December European Council. Let us be frank. There is still a big difference between the figures proposed by Parliament and those proposed by the Council. I want to be clear about this. The Commission supports the most ambitious possible agreement. The question, frankly, is: how far is the Council prepared to go? I therefore appeal for a compromise to be reached as soon as possible. If there is no compromise, it will be negative for all of us in the European Union, in particular for the new Member States and those Member States and regions that really need our solidarity for their development.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution could be to find the appropriate mix between three elements: flexibility, ways of mobilising the funds on the various flexibility mechanisms and, finally, the overall ceilings.</p>
<p class="contents">There is light at the end of the tunnel! A final trialogue is scheduled for 4 or 5 April 2006 in Strasbourg. It is my firm conviction that an agreement can be reached at that meeting. In the meantime, the Commission will continue to play its active role in seeking the most ambitious position, but, in the end, we need ambition with an agreement. Therefore, I approve of ambition but with realism and responsibility, trying to bring all the institutions on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Austrian Presidency is actively seeking an agreement with all the Member States. Let me tell you that at the various meetings I have had with the Heads of Government – and this week I have had several – I urged them, both publicly and privately, to accept an increase in overall expenditure. I quoted, in particular, the need for education and culture: the Erasmus and citizenship programmes. There, at least, we should make a real effort and some progress is possible. Let us all work hard towards reaching a good agreement and then, if we have good intentions, a good strategy and good policies. Let us hope that we also have good instruments in terms of the financial perspectives.</p>

In order for a strategic debate to take place in Parliament, choices need to be put to the House. The President of the Commission has not explained the choices open to the Commission, even though politics is the art of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">In first place is the constitutional question. Does the European Commission believe that the Constitution will be adopted in 2007, and does it have the opportunities and methods necessary to achieve this?</p>
<p class="contents">In second place is the important issue of employment. Is the answer to unemployment economic growth and reliance on economic freedom and the free movement of labour? If not, why not return to Colbert and economic protectionism, which was once called economic patriotism?</p>
<p class="contents">In third place, the issue of the Lisbon Strategy is a key problem for the future of the European Union. The matter has been reduced to rhetoric, as on the one hand we claim that the future of the European Union depends on the Lisbon Strategy, while on the other hand, when deciding on the budget and on budget cuts, the first cuts are made to scientific research and the education system. The European Union has the ability to make Europe a place of innovation and a global partner, but to do this it needs a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that today’s debate is evidence of the importance of Parliament, and it would be a good idea if all the other European institutions took Parliament seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The phrase that comes to mind is one often seen on a schoolboy’s report: ‘could do better’. Indeed, if your dream is to change the minds of the people of the European Union, it is a ‘must do better’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are treated to terms like ‘strategic objects’, ‘policy strategy’, ‘new directions’, ‘effective communications’ and ‘genuine dialogues’. We are promised that more money will be spent on regional funds, cohesion funds, social funds, globalised funds, fisheries funds, etc. – all this to gain the trust and commitment of the citizens. But where are the words ‘freedom’, ‘choice’ and ‘the individual’? George Orwell’s <span class="italic">1984</span> comes to mind – except that I believe he got the year wrong, but it is just around the corner; then it will be ‘control, control, control’ of the individual.</p>

I am sure if he parks his car more carefully in future he will be able to stay until the end of our debates, but no doubt the message will be taken back to him.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the title of this document: ‘boosting trust through action’. Sometimes you boost trust through action, and sometimes by non-action. Sometimes it is by withdrawing action, by sunset clauses, by reviews, and it is always by checking the small print of the proposals. We do nothing to boost confidence among our electors by having silly stories as we have had in the United Kingdom this week about church organs, and the European Union’s intention under the WEEE Directive to ban church organ repairs and building because of the lead content. That is daft and I hope if there is any threat of that there will be a swift telephone call from the Vatican to say that St Peter’s Basilica will not stand for such nonsense. However, that is the small print.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should be reconnecting with our constituents, we should relocate that purpose of our European venture and we should communicate it to the public. You do that for example by the next debate on energy, by showing that we are working together in solidarity to face any threats that there may be.</p>
<p class="contents">Montesquieu has been quoted. As Dumas wrote, ‘all for one and one for all’: we need the European grid of energy which can resist any attempt to pick off any one of our Member States. It is also about working on health to make sure that we have the collective work done on the flu pandemic preparations. We must take up the Austrian proposal for a diabetes framework; we must work hard on the Commission’s own proposal on mental health. Mrs Wallström will agree with me that we must work hard to convince the public that we can get it right on chemicals and on pollution issues, eco-labelling and all those other things which would make sense to the public. They would see it as value added by the European Union and then we will not have the same problems that some of our Member States had recently in terms of voting in referenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it hard to imagine why the European Commission, which declares the simplification of regulation as its aim, is not changing its own structures, not reorganising the work of its institutions, which after all create those complex documents. These things are simply incomprehensible and inconsistent. Let me give you a simple example. Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit. They went around various directorates hoping to acquire information on the work of a directorate. Everywhere they were given the same information. And the Commissioner who came to our Budget Committee even said that not all funds are used for public relations and publicity campaigns. But all work is duplicated. The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished. We absolutely must do something with the reform of the European Commission's work. The European Parliament at least is showing some initiative and aims to reform its work, so that we can implement those ambitious goals. I always regret the fact that we do not draw upon the experience of the new countries. We, the new countries, really understand that, first of all, we must reform our institutions. I trust that the European Commission will present a reform programme for its government structure as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point is that I am actually playing the ‘good cop’ as opposed to the ‘bad cop’ like Malcolm Harbour. I think this strategy is quite good. The Commission is coming forward with this at a very opportune time, when there is an atmosphere of nationalism and protectionism. As a matter of fact, unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before, Mr Barroso – I would call them ‘nato’: no action talk only – this one has a lot of action.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I agree with Mr Harbour that you might want to come up with an alternative name. You call this document – not necessarily very aptly – ‘boosting trust through action’. Perhaps you should seek some advice from an advertising agency before you come up with the next branding. It is a tough thing to do but that is not going to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that I agree with the focus on communication. Mrs Wallström, you of course play a very important part in doing that. We do not have a democratic deficit, we do not have an information deficit – we have almost too much of it – but we <span class="italic">do</span> have a communication deficit. The paper that you put forward on European communication is quite good. We have big problems: John Bowis was talking about church organs a second ago and of course we know that it is utter rubbish. However, when respectable broadsheets like <span class="italic">The Independent</span> come up with headlines like ‘EU forces you to recycle dildos’, then you are in trouble. It was about a directive on electrical appliances: if you take the appliance back to a store, it must be recycled. However, it is this type of communication that we really need to get rid of.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I wanted to make is that the EU is very often used as a scapegoat. Everything that is bad comes out of the EU, everything that is good comes from the Member States. Therefore, I would encourage you, Mrs Wallström, to focus more on communication on the Constitution. It is a good Constitution, we need it; keep it alive until spring 2007 and let us see what happens after that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore listen to you very carefully. We have already heard a number of points that would improve our paper. The same goes for the discussion I had with the Conference of Committee Chairmen. This will give us a lot, since we are able to have a truly political discussion about our priorities, the balance we want to achieve and the messages we want to send.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are coming back to the fact that we want to achieve results and we want to win trust. These are basic and core conditions for us in order to build a stronger European Union. Whatever title we choose, there will be linguistic or other problems with it. I am not sure we will ever be able to find something on which everybody agrees. However, our aim is that, by showing good results and by delivering on our commitments, we will also be able to build trust. If we engage in a democratic discussion and debate with citizens, it will also be easier to explain why we need constitutional reform in order to achieve those good results. That is the way we have to go: we have to engage with citizens in a democratic manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to have the opportunity to tell all the people in the UK that church organ pipes are not covered by the directive on electronic and electrical waste. You can fill all your churches with as many leaded pipes as you want. The Commission will not interfere with that. Just make sure that now and then the poor people in the UK hear the truth, as they rarely receive correct information. You can rest absolutely assured that the directive does not cover church organ pipes.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope we can open up the Council meetings. The Finnish Presidency is now preparing to make that a reality, and this will definitely help to end the blame game. If citizens can follow what their ministers do in the Council – the kinds of positions they take and statements they make, if they are there at all – it will help to end the blame game. Acting in partnership, we will all have to explain what the European Union does and what it is. Perhaps we can make some progress. I hope that during the Austrian Presidency we have made progress, because this is also a concern of yours. Definitely under the Finnish Presidency, where we can take it a step further, we should make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for all your wise comments on the annual policy strategy. I will definitely take all your comments back with me and pass them on to all the other Commissioners.</p>
