Following the first reading in Parliament, it took a year before we received the Council's common position, which takes almost no account at all of Parliament's views. And now, because of the timescales involved, such as the intervening summer recess, the situation is that Parliament has virtually no alternative but to repeat its position at first reading, with the result that we will all be merrily wending our way to the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This really is not how the codecision procedure should be conducted, at least not in my opinion. I am directing this comment to the Council: since Amsterdam there has been an ever increasing flow of legislative work on transport in particular. We would save time, money and energy procedurally speaking if the Council could appreciate and accept that a common position is not the end point of the decision-making process. It is an important stage in that process, but the process then continues and it must then come before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this all about? During the first trans-European network round, the issue of ports remained unresolved. At that time, the Commission undertook to prepare an appropriate proposal on ports. It has done that and has also extended the proposal to include not only seaports, but also inland ports and intermodal terminals, including Project No 8 of the 14 major projects in Essen, which is to be modified. Parliament has welcomed the Commission's approach of bringing together seaports, inland ports and terminals, because these are interrelated interconnection points in the transport network. The Council has only accepted certain parts of Parliament's proposals and totally departs from Parliament's criteria for interconnection points.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to concentrate on the most important aspects. First, seaports. Parliament would like the criteria here to be a traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes and 200 000 passengers, and also, as a vital and key criterion, a connection with another trans-European network. The Council wants a maximum of 1 million tonnes without a connection to other trans-European networks. However, this means that in my own dearly beloved Schleswig-Holstein, the region I come from, a place like Langballigau, which has at most one bridge and two bollards where a ship can tie up, has overnight turned into a European seaport, which is pure nonsense. Parliament simply cannot allow something like this to go through.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of inland ports, Parliament would like the criterion to be an annual traffic volume of 500 000 tonnes, as against the Council's criterion of just 300 000. The result is that an additional 200 smaller ports would be included. There would be so many and they would be so small you would need a magnifying glass to find them. That is not acceptable. I believe that if we are talking about a trans-European network, the seaports and inland ports involved should meet minimum requirements for European transport functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has endorsed the inclusion of intermodal terminals, whereas the Council completely disagreed with this, although terminals will of course have a far more significant part to play in future European transport policy than they perhaps do at present. Ports are in competition with each other, and that is a good thing. But in order to guarantee a level playing field Parliament requested that we should not be promoting superstructure investments but, at most, investment in infrastructure. The Council has so far not been able to accept this basic concern, and neither has the Commission, by the way. So we must work together to find solutions that will ensure a level playing field in terms of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that I welcome here is that the Council has evidently accepted the modification of Project No 8. Parliament is in agreement with this. However, this also means that the Council has finally accepted that codecision should also apply to the 14 important Essen projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever we agree tomorrow will ultimately have to go into the conciliation procedure. I would specifically like to acknowledge the French Presidency's efforts to establish a common approach at this early stage. The Council is being somewhat obstructive here. My thanks also go to the Commission's officials, who have already been very helpful on this. Nevertheless, it would have been good if everything could have proceeded a little faster than it has in the event. And last but not least I would like to thank my fellow Members in the committee, who have all pulled in the same direction. I would like to comment on Amendment No 15. The peripheral areas have been omitted from the English translation again, it is the original German version that applies. I hope that the Sittings Service will put this right so that the peripheral areas are once again referred to in all versions. And I would once again like to sincerely thank my colleagues in the committee for their cooperation. I hope that after tomorrow's vote we will be able to move promptly on to the conciliation procedure and not drag things out for the full six weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has consistently re-presented what we jointly agreed upon at first reading. He has translated it into a clear and easily understandable report. The main theme of this report is that if we are looking at European ports as part of the trans-European network, then we need a policy which provides for ports relevant to Europe's needs to be incorporated into that network. And they can only be relevant to Europe's needs if they are connected to other transport systems in the trans-European network.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the small amount of support that we give to trans-European networks must in that case, of course, also be directed to port infrastructure and not just towards port superstructure. This report is quite clear on that point. The corresponding amendments were also unanimously adopted in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on two additional points. If we do not concentrate on those ports that are really relevant to export and intra-Community trade, then we will face a situation in which all ports, including all yachting harbours, are classified as European ports. In that case the greatest danger would be a scattergun approach, not concentrating resources. This is also recognised in our regional policy, which Commissioner Barnier has referred to. We must point the way, but we can only do that if we support key projects in a truly consistent way instead of adopting a scattergun approach and subsidising all and sundry.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about the competitive situation not only between ports, but also within a single port. So if we were all allowed to provide state aid for buildings, van carriers and so on, there would be unacceptable competition between private and state companies operating at the same port, and also between different ports.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a clear pan-European policy on ports which really does respect competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are, therefore, what would appear to be reasonable increases in freight and passenger traffic volume thresholds. Of course, putting each type of proposed measure on an equal footing will cause problems unless objective requirements are also put on an equal footing. For example, as regards the subject under discussion, an extensive hinterland which is currently served by a large number of ports could start channelling traffic to just a few of them in order to ensure that they meet the more stringent eligibility criteria. If, for example, there are two ports, one could be promoted over the other. However, if a relatively small or medium-sized island is currently served by just one port, how is it supposed to increase its traffic? Objectively-speaking, it cannot do so; is it therefore right that a country with a lot of islands which necessarily has many such ports cannot benefit from the same advantages for its port infrastructure? And what about the cohesion we are all fighting for? And the provision in the Amsterdam Treaty for the special treatment which island regions obviously require?</p>
<p class="contents">My speaking time is running out, Mr President, and I shall finish there; but before I do, as we are debating shipping, I too should like to express my deep-felt sorrow at the loss of life of our fellow human beings who were travelling on one of the many ships needed to serve the many Greek islands, which obviously therefore require a great deal of specific interest on our part. This interest needs to be manifested constantly as there will always be numerous islands with natural features which we cannot change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the trans-European networks is to link up different regions of the EU, so that the common market may function effectively. The rapporteur, however, has viewed the matter mainly from the angle of large ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of tonnes given for freight are important, but they do not always tell the whole truth. The kind of freight also has a decisive impact on volume. In the peripheral regions ports are particularly important, although the volume of freight and number of passengers are smaller than in central areas. For example, the proposal to raise the volume in tonnes of freight to 1.5 million in respect of seaports and to change the classification of ports will not, in the opinion of our group, serve the development of the trans-European networks. This would mean that the ports in the TENs would be concentrated on the densely populated central areas, and many sparsely populated peripheral regions would accordingly remain outside the TENs.</p>
<p class="contents">The other travesty here is that only international traffic is included in passenger numbers for TEN ports. For example, ferry traffic between Scotland and Northern Ireland accounts for 1.8 million passengers a year, but these ports would remain outside the TEN if just international traffic were to be included. This service is not just important as a link between Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it is also important for the Irish Republic. Smaller, important ports and the Union’s internal passenger traffic must also be taken better account of. For that reason, our group opposes Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10, among others. In this respect the Council’s position would serve the development of trans-European networks more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Green Group has a love-hate relationship with transport. After all, transport creates pollution but there are certain modes of transport which create more pollution than others. This means that we do not wholeheartedly endorse all elements of the TENs, but we do if they involve the development of the less polluting alternatives, for example the development of ports, the development and promotion of inland shipping and the use of intermodal terminals.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to that element of those ports, if you consider the Council’s viewpoint on ports – and this has been put in more than one way – the quantitative criterion used is, in my opinion, too sweeping and too vague, which results in a situation in which some ports in the German Wadden area and some in the Netherlands, such as the port of Scheveningen, which is a small fishing port, have now been elevated to the status of ports which would be required to play a role in the trans-European network. This is simply taking things too far, in my book.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur’s view, but I should add that, actually, if you look for something which is also lacking in the Council’s position, then I would say that the Council is underplaying the significance of intermodal terminals and, above all, the multimodal terminals, for they are much talked about in this Chamber. As a result, we are lacking the qualitatively sound arguments for incorporating ports, often located on the fringes – as was mentioned a moment ago – into this scheme. In addition to the quantitative criteria, a number of qualitative criteria will need to be developed. But we will soon be entering conciliation when we will need to consider this issue in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that at least the rapporteur has put this intermodal transport – Mr Jarzembowski worded it very well – very much on the agenda. I believe that this will become one of the bones of contention which we will hopefully – with or without a conference – be able to bring to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely pleased that, in addition to this, all of the reports on strategic effects have been included. I hope that they will not be the sacrificial lamb of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the superstructure and its funding, I can understand very well why we are not incorporating superstructure, the definition of which is, in fact, far from agreed, into a non-transparent and vague financing method for ports. The port structure and its correct definition is the first step, a superstructure the second. In my view, we should be looking at how we can add more detail in the meantime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is once again illustrated by Mr Piecyk’s report on seaports and inland ports. This report and these amendments, in fact, deal with a number of very different situations. As before, when we were discussing reports on marine pollution and air traffic, we need to draw a distinction between North and South, large and small, and policy which is driven by profit and that which is driven by environmental considerations. It is therefore not easy to use the same yardstick to assess all ports across the European Union. According to some, the report and its amendments enable small ports to strengthen their position, ports which are indispensable for the accessibility and survival of islands and remote coastal areas. Based on this viewpoint, every small port and every ferry port which handles a great deal of tourist traffic should feature on the European list. Port policy would then mainly focus on offering support to peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in Europe’s most densely populated area around the North Sea and the Channel, there are major ports, including that of my home town, Rotterdam. They are caught up in a bitter competitive battle, partly brought on by the fact that they are offering as many facilities as possible to transport companies at the lowest possible rates. Rotterdam wants to remain the world’s largest port and competes with Le Havre, Dunkirk, Zeebrugge, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Bremen and Hamburg for the same cargo volumes. There is even a notion that Rotterdam should be a “mainport” where all goods reaching the European west coast from other continents must be transhipped to vessels which distribute them to the surrounding ports. Other large ports too are striving for growth and dominance.</p>
<p class="contents">This competitive battle is at the expense of the environment and at the expense of the financial elbowroom of the large cities. European port policy should be able to do something about this and should be able to distribute the cargo volumes over a larger area. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find initiatives to this effect in any of the proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The emphasis is on routes between different Member States. Logically, this means that attention will be focused on projects with cross-border implications.</p>
<p class="contents">The transport situations within the different Member States are far from identical. Whereas in the southern Member States, road and rail are the key modes of continental transport, the more northerly countries prefer to rely mainly on water transport. Against this background, it goes without saying that the TENs mirror these modes of transport and the interaction between them. Moreover, those modalities which cause least harm in terms of space and the environment must be included in the TENs without fail.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my frame of reference for Mr Piecyk’s report which deals with the position of ports in the TENs. Very often, seaports are the first and last ports of call for cargo in Europe. The link with the hinterland can be made in different ways.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that virtually all goods which pass through those seaports must change mode of transport at least once. Transhipment and, along with this, transhipment terminals are what are needed. Ruling these terminals out in the TENs certainly does not benefit any mode of transport. I therefore subscribe to the rapporteur’s views in this respect without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that TENs are used for what they were set up for and in order to maintain an overview of them all, it is impossible to include all EU ports in the network. A certain minimum number is therefore inevitable. In my opinion, the criteria formulated by the rapporteur in this respect fit in best within the framework requested by the EP.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the rapporteur has made proposals which I hope the Council will take to heart. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not going to highlight the parts of the report on which we agree, but I would like to point out a couple of issues which worry me and also worry certain other Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I must say that I come from a group of islands in the Mediterranean – as the rapporteur well knows – and we have the impression that the large ports are being promoted, mainly the northern ports as opposed to the southern ports. The small ports, and mainly the ports in the outlying regions and the islands, are rather being left out of this promotion of marine transport.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to see in this case is recognition for example, that it would be beneficial to apply to the ports the division which is carried out in the case of airports of different categories so that we can concentrate, not on the categories of ports, but on the specific projects. That is to say, the project that is being presented, its objectives and all the actions implemented within that project. I believe that would be the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In our case, in the Balearic Islands – I come from Palma de Mallorca – the port of Palma would be included in the proposals in Mr Piecyk’s report, but other ports in the same islands would be left out and this would lend support to air transport. Air transport would become the best way to transport goods and passengers to certain islands and outlying regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently trying to promote marine transport as an alternative to air transport, and this is therefore an issue to be considered. Having made these points, which are differences of opinion rather than disagreements, it only remains for me to express our support for this report and to congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The distance from the port of Pasajes, in the Basque Country, to Vlissingen, in Holland, is approximately the same whether one travels by sea, road or rail. A cargo of cars and caravans can easily be transported on a small ship of two thousand tonnes, instead of the 204 lorries or 7 trains with 102 wagons which would be required to transport the same load.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the three systems, with regard to total external costs, in terms of road congestion, accidents, noise, atmospheric pollution and climate change, vary considerably: EUR 74 000 for the ship, EUR 130 000 for the lorries and EUR 99 000 for the railway. I believe we should draw the conclusion that sea transport is the most appropriate solution and it should receive public resources as a priority. I also agree that we should select the most important ports – as Mr Piecyk points out – as well as those which conform to intermodality and, above all, the ports which allow us to make the greatest savings in terms of environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other conclusions of the report, I agree with Mr Piecyk that the Council’s position is more restrictive. Some will consider it to be broader, but I believe that it is more restrictive in relation to the effective use of European funds intended for that purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has already been pointed out by almost all those who have spoken that, in effect, the situation with regard to transport – particularly sea transport – and seaports differs widely throughout our Union: the situation in northern countries differs from that in southern countries, in terms of dimensions and the volume of freight and passenger traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we wish – and we do, for we consider it absolutely essential – sea and river ports to be included in the system of trans-European networks and to have their own system, then we must by necessity establish a hierarchy and a classification list for this system.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I come from a country which boasts 8 000 km of coastline and would therefore benefit greatly from having as many of its ports as possible included in the "European port" category. However, we have to be prepared to stick our necks out and take what could be difficult decisions for the very reason that, if the strategies selected do not genuinely identify areas and ports with these characteristics, we will be in danger, considering, amongst other things, the lack of funding – we shall have to talk about this in any case for only EUR 400 million are available – we will be in danger of undoing any good work, in danger, that is, of being ineffective. One issue remains to be resolved – which I consider important and which other Members have raised and should therefore be at the centre of the conciliation process – and that is the issue of the islands and the outermost regions: in other words, the issue of those situations in which, even where a port does not meet the volume criteria we have laid down, its activity cannot be allowed to suffer as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where competition is concerned, the market plays the key role in the development of seaports. That much we are all agreed upon, and we should not interfere with that base. I therefore request as a matter of urgency, even if Georg Jarzembowski is sitting next to me, that Parliament should reconsider its decision of March last year. Parliament wants the criterion to be an annual freight traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes, but it is ridiculous to ignore the potential of ports with a volume of at least 1 million tonnes, especially if they meet the strategic requirements of the trans-European networks. We should therefore have faith in market forces and give smaller ports a chance too.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to promote short sea shipping, but that means we also need smaller ports, which have a valuable role to play here. They act as interconnection points, small ones perhaps but important interconnection points. And are you telling me that you want to argue about half a million tonnes and exclude smaller ports? What would a minimum traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes achieve? According to the documents I have it would mean excluding 30 European ports, above all those in peripheral areas or coastal areas that are structurally weak. That cannot be in our interest. Investment in the trans-European network only makes sense if we create genuine networks covering wide areas and bringing advantages for the public throughout the European Union. A forward-looking maritime strategy should not be exclusive, it should be inclusive. I therefore ask the rapporteur and the others who have spoken to give this their learned support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue of inland ports and intermodal terminals is very complex and I would like to stress that a broad consensus has been achieved. We all agree that the trans-European network must be a multimodal network. We also believe that we all agree that it must include the main points of connection, and that we consider that the current provisions of the trans-European networks on ports are not satisfactory and that strengthening the role of ports within the network will also serve to consolidate the trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament and the Commission broadly agree on most of the areas under discussion. We agree that the inclusion of too many ports in the network may affect this concept of ‘trans-European’ and that, therefore, the most strategically important inland ports should be included. I also believe that Parliament and the Commission agree that inland terminals are an important part of the network and play a fundamental role in the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not discussing economic aid today, but I would like to mention on this point that we believe that this economic support should be utilised correctly and not be directed towards superstructure projects which may, at the end of the day, have a negative effect on competition. Nevertheless, there are certain points on which it will be difficult to make progress, since, while we can make progress between Parliament and the Commission, we should not forget the fundamental role of the Council in this decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make some comments about the main amendments. Amendment No 4: to increase the threshold for inland ports from 300 to 500 tonnes. This proposal is perfectly acceptable to the Commission. Mr Piecyk’s report justifies this idea by saying that the trans-European networks should not have to include an excessive number of installations.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, the ideal solution would be to only include ports which, as well as complying with these limits, are equipped with transhipment facilities. We believe that this point of view is not accepted by the Council, but we consider that the quantity is not sufficient in itself. We believe that we have to introduce both qualitative and quantitative elements.</p>
<p class="contents">Seaports: Amendments Nos 5, 9 and 10. We could also accept the idea of increasing the threshold to one and a half million tonnes or two hundred thousand passengers and we could also agree to the removal of classifications by categories implemented by the Council. This point will certainly be the subject of further debate by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 7 reintroduce the map of inland terminals and are acceptable to the Commission. However, we believe that the most important issue is to highlight the fact that inland terminals are an integral part of the network, and it does not seem relevant to us whether they appear on a map or not. We consider that to be a problem of secondary importance. The important thing is clearly that they form part of the network. We feel that perhaps the intermediate solution could be to abandon the map of intermodal terminals and draw up more precisely, more thoroughly, if you like, the guidelines emphasising that intermodal terminals form part of the network, and not to enter into a debate on the map, which would make things more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of superstructures excluded from Community funding: Amendments Nos 8 and 10. The Commission can also support these amendments and it is true that, nevertheless, we believe that this debate may raise some difficulties. We support the aim of the amendments but, nevertheless, we cannot support their wording. On the one hand, because we believe it is inappropriate to talk about the funding of these guidelines and, secondly, because we do not believe it is necessary to make this reference. It is the case that the types of project which Parliament is referring to when it talks of superstructures are not included in the projects of common interest and do not therefore have funding. This is therefore, to a certain extent, an unnecessary debate.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment on Amendment No 15: as an objective, this amendment is acceptable to the Commission. We believe that the idea is correct, although we believe that here also we should analyse the wording with a little more care in order to prevent problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to Community spending and public aid and the issue involving competences, we believe that it is also important, that it should be debated in the future and, to this end, we believe that we should work to reach a solution on this and the other remaining problems, taking account of the interests of all parties, and we believe that agreement is possible on the basis of Parliament’s excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
