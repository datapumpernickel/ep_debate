This course of action amounts to closing down some 270 Info-Points in the European Union, each of which receives approximately EUR 20 000 per annum to support them in their work, but it does not, in principle, affect other Info-Points attached to other, larger institutional structures such as national or regional parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by pointing out that the Commission did not think it necessary to inform Parliament about this, whether by writing to it or within the framework of the Interinstitutional Information Group, which, as you will be aware, is composed of the chairmen of Parliament’s Committees and the Commissioners responsible for information and communications policy. I leave it to you to judge the quality of our interinstitutional relations! In this instance, however, we are not dealing with a simple financial problem, such as often crops up with programmes or projects in other policy areas. This, on the other hand, is about a strict interpretation of the new Financial Regulation and about the serious consequences – for us and the Commission – resulting from such a rigorous application of this legal act.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that the new Financial Regulation that we adopted in this House, does not permit operating grants, but a solution must nevertheless be found to this grave problem so that the Info-Points affected can continue to work through 2004 and can continue to inform the public about the activities of the European Union and the work that we do on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be aware that the European elections, although they are often described as a matter for Parliament, are not only that; they are far more a process of active public participation in which the Commission should also join. The Info-Points and Carrefours make a substantial contribution to the European Union’s information and communications policy, and their significance should not be underestimated, particularly at a time when enlargement is within sight and in view of the continued and increasing need for information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The European elections and the signing of the EU’s new constitution are almost upon us, and need particular attention in addition to ongoing information on what is going on in the EU. These information offices, which are intended to address primarily the local population and people living in the regions, are indispensable, and so I would like to put three questions to you, and I would also like to urge you to answer them. What action will the Commission be taking to guarantee that the networks and Info-Points can carry on unhindered with their valuable work in a year that is to see both the European elections and the enlargement of the EU? How will the Commission ensure the future provision of funding for this work? When will the Commission take a decision on the funding arrangements for the future? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not within my portfolio but I am told it was not intentional, and would not want it to lead to any deterioration in the essential cooperation between our institutions. We recognise the acuteness of feelings, especially since the work of the information system and centres is of clear importance not only to Members of this House, but also to anyone committed to developing an understanding of the European Union, what it does and what it stands for.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member has made it clear that she, like many other Members, has criticisms of the Commission's decision to cancel from next year the operating grants hitherto provided to networks and Info-Points. I would therefore like to clarify exactly which information outlets we are dealing with, explain the nature, size and impact of the subsidies provided by the Commission to them and update her and the House on the Commission’s latest course of action in direct response to her question and the numerous questions and representations on this issue by Members of this House and others.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently more than a thousand grassroots public information relays and networks overseen by the Commission’s Directorate General for Press and Communication. They are housed in what are known as 'host structures', which are generally national, regional or local authorities, NGOs or universities. They include: 126 rural information and promotion Carrefours; 140 Info-Points Europe <span class="bold"></span> IPE <span class="bold"></span> in urban areas of the Union; nearly 800 European Documentation Centres <span class="bold"></span> EDC <span class="bold"></span> generally situated in large higher education establishments worldwide; and a network of around 500 experts in one or more areas of European Union policy as conference or other forms of public speakers known as 'Team Europe'.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these public information relays receive support services in kind from the Commission. The main types of support are: free public documentation and publication: around 3 million copies a year and specialised assistance via a dedicated helpdesk at a cost of about EUR 1.5 million a year; free training for relay staff totalling about 800 person-days a year; access to an interactive intranet; and an exchange programme for relay staff <span class="bold"></span> with over 3 000 person-days a year.</p>
<p class="contents">These services are designed to help the relays provide their correspondents with quick and up-to-date responses to their questions on EU policies, programmes and funding opportunities. They are not in jeopardy. It has long been the Commission’s intention not only to maintain such technical assistance but also to increase it.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, it is important to note, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that only the 266 host structures of the first two of these relays and networks – the IPEs and Carrefours – have ever received operating grants from the Commission since DG Press started overseeing them in 2001. They generally amount to about EUR 20 000 a year or EUR 5.4 million in total. In the majority of cases, the money given to the host structures has been supplemented by larger contributions provided from domestic resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House is aware, the Financial Regulation that came into force on 1 January 2003 no longer permits direct operating subsidies to be awarded to external bodies without either a call for proposals or the establishment of a legal basis for expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add that, in its 2002 Activity Report, the Director-General of DG Press felt compelled to enter a reservation about the management of the relays because it was not possible to guarantee, with the resources at its disposal, proper monitoring and control of a relatively high number of small grants. Those misgivings were borne out by the recent findings of the Commission’s Internal Audit Service which recommended first, the development of different working methods and audit practices, second, the introduction of more appropriate management tools, and third, the improvement of the standard of agreements and the structure of the expenditure financed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore confirms that the proposal adopted on 29 September 2003 to terminate grants with effect from 2004 complied fully with the Financial Regulation and its implementing provisions. It was therefore right, in legal terms and for practical purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges, of course, that the decision provoked sharp reactions and protests from many national relay coordinators, several Member States, and several Members of this House. We understand the reasons but we also seek to abide by the letter and spirit of the law of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the amendment to the 2004 draft budget tabled in this House, and placing in reserve the appropriations under three of the budget headings related to the activities of DG Press, the Commission was given the task of trying to reach an accommodation that, as far as possible, satisfied the demands for operational continuity sought by Parliament, whilst also securing financial monitoring and control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the particular political importance of the year ahead and, in response to the honourable Member’s question, I would make the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, at our meeting on 11 November 2003, the Commission noted that we would have to take up the matter of host entities’ grants again, with a view to taking a final decision in the light of the outcome of the budget trialogue of 13 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, in order to retain the current system for 2004, there would need to be a Commission decision providing for a waiver to the rule in the Financial Regulation that requires a call for proposals that is accompanied by adequate monitoring and control provisions tailored to the results of risk analysis and backed by a joint policy declaration by the three institutions. This solution would be justifiable for one year only, but may provide a kind of bridge that would ensure the continuity the honourable Member seeks.</p>
<p class="contents">That proposed solution was subsequently examined by the budgetary trialogue and will now be formally presented for approval at the Conciliation Committee meeting of 24 November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the honourable Member’s third question, the Commission has instructed DG Press to formulate proposals that will ensure the proper availability of comprehensive information for citizens in the Union of 25 Member States. These proposals, to be set out in a communication that will hopefully be produced before Christmas, will build on the July 2002 communication on Information and Communication Strategy for the European Union, and will follow four principles for relay management set out in that communication: a more homogenous brand; a more streamlined and decentralised set of information outlets and networks; closer partnership with Member State authorities; and more interinstitutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The relays act as a uniquely important bridge between the European Union’s policy-making mechanism and the citizens to whom we are all accountable. The Commission will therefore do its utmost to ensure that they continue to provide that facility at the dispersed centres throughout the Union, which obviously is one of the features that gives them their greatest value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will not find anybody in this House prepared to defend this removal, you do not do so and the Commission in no way does so, I would say again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a peculiar situation, which is curious, because in an atmosphere of budgetary forecasts, such as the one we are in at the moment, with conciliation scheduled for next Monday, we are seeing the story of a lack of budgetary foresight, in other words, that regulation, which enters into force on 1 January 2003 and which has not received the attention of any Commission body until the communication of 29 September in which the issue of subsidies for information centres was considered settled.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not insist on the importance of information centres, since Mr Kinnock himself has pointed it out – in your words, this is an essential element. This morning in the joint debate it was expressed by Mrs Rühle and Mrs Hieronymi, it has just been expressed by Mrs Prets and I believe that we should all be in agreement. Furthermore, the European Parliament has highlighted it on several occasions, such as in the report on information and communication policy which it was my honour to present to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In that report I pointed out that information centres were useful in terms of reaching all corners of the European Union and how they could be useful meeting points and instruments for the work of MEPs in their respective constituencies. Amendment 42 of the Rühle report, which the Commission opposed this morning, also stressed the importance of these information centres. The effects of removal have also been stressed by Mr Kinnock, in the sense that 270 may be deprived of subsidies and some 1000 would be affected. I therefore feel it is important to seek a transitional provision, such as that of maintaining a kind of phasing-out of these subsidies during 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to analyse a certain contradiction between the Commission’s position in the Interinstitutional Group on information and its attitude in relation to information centres. On 23 September of this year, we attended a meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on information and we observed once again Commissioner Vitorino's enthusiasm with regard to the need to arbitrate these measures and to coordinate the actions of all instruments in view of the three fundamental challenges facing us; enlargement, the new Constitution and the European elections. Six days later, it published the communication we are debating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to believe that there was no knowledge of it and that there could have been no mention of it in the Interinstitutional Group on information. Mr Vidal-Quadras, chairman of that information group, stressed it in a letter addressed personally to Commissioner Vitorino. I therefore believe that there is legitimate doubt about what we should believe most, his fine words or the firmness of his actions, and we believe that the two things should be coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the need to seek a legal basis for the invitations for offers of participation, I would suggest to the Commission that it introduce three principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the simplification of the procedure – information centres are small units, they are not multinationals which can dedicate a unit to filling in thousands of forms in order to obtain subsidies or Community funds; secondly, the staff in these information centres should be given professional status, making them true information and communication professionals, and not simply auxiliary staff to hand out brochures – as Mr Kinnock has said; and, thirdly, the criterion of proportionality in order to provide a policy such as information and communication policy, which is essential to the future of the European Union, with sufficient means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows clearly that we can imagine the most innovative of policies possible, but when the budgetary machine is established, it is one-eyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bayona de Perogordo highlighted this. The assessment of all of us, since there is impressive unanimity on this point, is that we must compensate for the democratic deficit between us and the public. To a lesser extent, we should also compensate for the deficit as regards internal communication and information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a product of adult education and am convinced that knowledge and information are the key instruments of active and responsible citizenship, so I can only welcome the excellent work carried out by the Info-Points Europe. They are educational, they are innovative, they have a remarkable capacity for initiative and, above all, they enable us to raise awareness of Europe and to spread Europe’s messages to its citizens of all ages, all areas, and all cultures with a proximity that cannot be matched and that other institutions fail to match.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that it is because we provide a financial contribution that this is possible. In fact, we call on other powers to carry out this communication role for us. These other powers are local powers that are sensitive to the European question, naturally, but that might, if we do not make more effort, wish to return to their initial role and perhaps abandon this vital aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">If the support we are going to be guaranteed for 2004 gave us the time to conceive arrangements for collaboration that enabled this system to continue on a permanent basis, that would indeed be effective. It would also enable us, since the other partners also have budgetary contingencies, to continue to operate and to make plans for the coming years. It would be insane to abandon these proposals at the risk of losing transparency and, thus, European democracy. I believe that the solutions are simple: administrative simplification, respect for work and, what is perhaps also necessary, an audit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The citizens of the European Union will also be the losers as a result of this end to operating subsidies for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be frank: at a time when Europe is facing enormous difficulties in moving closer to the citizens and raising its profile, an undeniable gap is opening up once again. For example, the closure of the European Carrefours is a great loss as regards the information distributed in the most rural regions. The decentralised structures are an essential asset and given the immense amount of communications work to be done, these structures must be maintained, or even receive additional funding enabling them to play their role to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when Europe is at an important turning point in its history, benefiting from a forthcoming enlargement and Constitution, it would be unacceptable to put an end to the necessary and vital aid of the Info-Points. In light of this context, we must combine all of our efforts to find a fair solution because we are all worried. The Info-Points are, and must continue to be, among the Community’s communication tools. Their activity and the efforts made by these structures have proved the effectiveness of their action. The Info-Points have always made every effort to carry out the role entrusted to them, in this case acting as an interface for a dynamic platform. Close to the citizens, they have made it possible to maintain a European social fabric. So are we going to remain deaf and mute in the face of the expectations of the public, who constantly need to be informed of our interinstitutional activities?</p>
<p class="contents">Being aware of this need and convinced of the important role played by these structures, I call on the Commission to review its decision and to allow these European information networks to continue to perform the functions we have entrusted to them, which are more essential now then ever. I thank the Commissioner for being here and, in response to his comments, I will say that it is all the better if there are other documentation centres and forums that have the Commission’s support, but it does not disguise the fact that the information deficit is all too real and not appreciated by the public. If a legal basis is required – and this may well be the case – one must be established. However, a minimum amount of time is needed to resolve this type of problem and that does not mean four months, Commissioner. That seems to be much too short and the Commission’s methods far from courteous, so we hope that the proposal for a trialogue meets with a favourable response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, these information centres are close to the citizen, and this can be taken literally. The information centres are physically present in the provinces. The proximity of the centres ensures that those seeking information do not have to travel a long way, saving them time and money. I think that this is the EU’s trump card, and a way of being customer friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament has already stated its opinion on the European Union’s information and communication strategy, and, in so doing, has expressed the desire to bring communications as close as possible to the citizen. In its motion for a resolution, it expresses the desire to invest more in a well-functioning information network, including<span class="bold"> </span>Info-Points. The word is ‘invest’, not ‘abolish’. I quote: ‘The European Parliament ... considers that there is a need to introduce measures for administrative adjustment, structuring and staff training, aimed at the effective operation of the external offices and the network of information centres ..., which could also be used by MEPs in their respective constituencies’.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about bringing the European Union closer to the citizen and bridging the gap with the citizen – because research reveals that that gap really exists – investing more in the Info-Points is part of the solution. I should like to make a plea, then, that we by no means abolish these<span class="bold"> </span>Info-Points, but, on the contrary, improve their functioning, particularly now, in the light of the elections and enlargement taking place in 2004. We must not make savings on the promotion of the European Union, a Union that brings peace, security and prosperity to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall put some simple questions to which we all know the answers and on which we are all agreed. Is the average European citizen in need of extra information about the European Union? Yes. Is information needed in the Member States and locally rather than in Brussels? Yes. Do the Info-Points help meet that need? Yes. Is next year, with enlargement, with the new Constitution, with elections, a year when the information will be more necessary than usual? Yes. Has the Commission got its organisation and priorities right on information policy? That is questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course expenditure must meet legal requirements and if a legal base is necessary then it must be found. We employ lawyers precisely to check on those points in good time, advise if there is a problem and indicate a solution. We knew about the problem in January and the Commission's solution was to send the Info-Points a letter at the end of September. That really is not good enough. After all, the amount of expenditure is pretty minimal. It has been allocated over a good many years.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission doubts the need for Info-Points and the more effective information programme, let me draw attention to statistics in recent polls. 90% of Spaniards have never heard of the Convention. 31% of Germans have never heard of the Commission and 25% of Britons do not even know that the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union <span class="bold"></span> but 7% of them think that America is!</p>
<p class="contents">The English language is rich in expressions. Let me try and find some that fit this situation. The tail is wagging the dog. The Commission appears to be unable to see the wood for the trees. Experts should be on tap, not on top. I could carry on with vulgar expressions about breweries and organising parties in them. There is not a major legal difficulty here, it is a technical problem. If the Commission had clear and accepted priorities and could see the wood for the trees, we would not be having this debate this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Commissioner Kinnock's statement, but he knows as well as we do that it has come far too late and it really should not have been necessary. Sadly, this is another own goal by the Commission. I hope that the letter that will be sent to the Info-Points will contain an apology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For my part, I am going to consider a more financial aspect, that is, the Financial Regulation – the new Financial Regulation. I believe that we all agree on that issue too. We worked together, Parliament approved it and it has been accepted. All that remains is to implement it. We also all agree that the procedures under this Financial Regulation must be adhered to, including the procedures that allow for genuine transparency in the implementation of the budget. Moreover, if we have understood correctly, the Commission has been given every <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> resource required for this implementation. I believe, Mr Kinnock, that this is a key element not only in this case, but also for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For the implementation of the budget, however, it is also essential for the sums to arrive on time. We talk in the industry of ‘just on time’, and that is where the problem lies. We are now in a situation where the Commission did not think far enough ahead and where, rather than coming to see us to explain that perhaps there was a problem or further difficulties, it waited until we were alerted by the public and by the networks, and are now extremely worried.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only was the Commission slow in warning us, Mr Kinnock; more important, several things have been covered up. For example, when we are told that ‘several structures have agreed not to receive any money’, I disagree! Several structures have agreed to be provided with material resources, but have never said that they did not need any money. I find this approach somewhat disagreeable in view of the need for us to be as sincere as possible in our joint work.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we must find a solution for 2004 and I believe that we will find it on Monday. In any event, I hope that we will, so that it can continue through to 2005. However, what we need now is for the Commission to assure us that it is going to be able to implement the solution that I am sure we are going to find, without fail and in good time to enable the Info-Points to continue operating. This is vital, as we have said, for Europe cannot withstand any further democratic breakdown. Europe can continue to work at an administrative level, but without the citizens it will not do so for long, and the Info-Points are one of the key intermediaries in ensuring that we finally have a Europe of Citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, it often happens, as Mr Perry has already said, that the wrong people get criticised. So, there is no legal basis; I do not believe there is any political will either, or, if there is, it is at least deficient. And if the political will is lacking, then what happens – as it has done in this case – is that people try a partial solution of the problem for a short transitional period, without coming up with a proper arrangement for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as politicians whose business is with Europe, know for a fact that national politicians have a very pronounced tendency to project their own defects, errors and inabilities onto Brussels and to heap curses upon it. That is easily done, it goes down well, and there is as a rule no risk of them being put straight. I believe that information agencies on the European Union counteract this sort of tendency.</p>
<p class="contents">They know how the media report things, and not only in their own country. Reporting of the European Union is deficient in other countries too; there too, it needs to be counteracted, and those Info-Points and offices, which are in a position to supply objective information, are the offices that are working for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If Info-Points and likewise Carrefours are to be phased out and we now hear that there is the possibility of a transitional period of a year or perhaps even longer, that does nothing to counteract this tendency. It is not that we need another year or two because we have elections next year; it is that we need a solution for the future! Commissioner, it is for me a matter of profound conviction that if we talk in terms – as we have done several times today – of pooling strengths, then we must also consider the need to link up the offices of Parliament and the Commission in the Member States with the Info-Points and Carrefours, in order to build up our presence in the territory in question. We have to embark on a general expansion of the information services, and we have to change our priorities. It is a matter of absolute necessity that we involve the Member States’ voluntary sectors in these information offices and strive towards improving cooperation with local organisations and bodies, making for greater efficiency and better financial conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is how a clever and experienced Commissioner obviously operates, but thank you, Neil Kinnock, for what you just said.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, on that day, 29 September, when the Directorate-General for Press and Communication sent off a letter to all the Info-Points, it was as if a lump of ice had been dropped in the bath water. It rocked the boat and people panicked. One obviously cannot act this way, and all of us here are proof of that.</p>
<p class="contents">These Info-Points have only been set up in recent years, and the Commission has itself made the excellent remark that these centres had an extremely valuable contribution to make as they had a good deal of experience and could work flexibly and very close to civil society and the people, and that they were a vital tool in the European Union’s information and communication strategy, representing the EU in the field. Excellent. You yourself provided evidence of this as the Commission, and I believe that in the future too you will ensure that there are information points in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been mentioned here that the need for information is growing. The impact of enlargement will create a continuous need for information in all Member States. People have to be informed about the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, in other words the Constitutional Treaty. This is a document more than 300 pages long, which so far fewer than 2% of the citizens of the Union have read. The parliamentary elections and in particular the attempt to increase people’s interest in voting in them are of course massive tasks, which the points may happily be saddled with.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards of monitoring have to be improved. If it is a matter of some points operating slightly dubiously, I would like the Commissioner to comment, but clearly that cannot be allowed to affect the entire network – those sections which have acted properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in favour of the idea that next year the Commission will seek a better, more workable and more easily controllable solution. The need for information is growing as more and more issues are decided upon here, Europe’s central point, and I therefore support the Commissioner in his reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The very replies given by Commissioner Kinnock – which were actually too cautious, almost embarrassed – confirm that the instability which we are condemning is real and that the problems are genuine. Furthermore, we have already tabled a written question, on 9 October 2003: I was the first to put my name to it, but 48 MEPs signed it from all the political groups. This question referred, in a much more detailed, specific way, to the concerns of those working – some for many years – at Info Centres, Info-Points and Carrefours, all the European information points. Now, given that we have still not received a written reply – at least not one that I have seen – I will take the liberty of quickly going over the points in this question.</p>
<p class="contents">It began by stressing how the European Parliament, exactly as it is doing today, has often drawn attention to the importance, as regards information and communication policy, of these networks created in more or less all the Member States. The Commission, too, stressed a similar opinion, and did so in two official documents: Communication 354 of 2001 and Communication 350 of 2002, which concluded with more or less the same words, saying that Info-Points, Info Centres and Carrefours are invaluable heritage because of their experience, flexibility and immediate vicinity to the representatives of civil society and the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Even Mr Prodi specifically praised these institutions in a reply given to another question on 27 September 2002. Not least, he said that awareness of the measures proposed and the projects implemented by the European Union is increasing thanks to the information networks. This is why we are even more bewildered and saddened to read the letter of 29 September 2003, in which the DG Press, contrary to all these good promises, notified the national structures housing these networks that extending the agreement for 2004 would no longer include the right to a subsidy, whilst, as far as the future is concerned, the Commission will look into – as the text states – new forms of cooperation. As Commissioner Kinnock mentioned, this is all because of the entry into force, on 1 January 2003, of Financial Regulations No 1605 and No 2342.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a new and unprecedented situation which places a question mark over the very survival of these networks and, in any case, drastically reduces the capacity for dialogue with the citizens at precisely a time when, on the contrary, such dialogue should be increased. There is a great need, Commissioner, an infinite thirst for knowledge – as other Members have said, even from the opposite bench – at this time, as we are approaching the European elections, when the European Constitution is taking shape and when enlargement will soon be taking place, which will certainly mean that this need for information will be even more widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to stress the need for an immediate reply to the queries contained in the written question. What does the Commission intend to do to act in good time, for example to give legal personality to Carrefours and to Info-Points by applying Articles 54, 55 and 185 of Council Regulation No 1605 of 2002? Above all, though, an immediate reply must be given for 2004: it is not enough to say ‘we will guarantee it for a year but for any longer we are not sure’. In saying this I am thinking, above all, of the most disadvantaged areas, of these rural Carrefours, especially in mountain regions, that are often the only, irreplaceable sources of information and a sign that the European institution is close to the people, especially in these disadvantaged areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Rocard for raising this important subject. The Info-Points Europe in the Member States are a natural and simple channel for the public to acquire information on the European Union. Of course that has been said here several times but I feel I have to repeat it myself. As a channel of communication they are perhaps not irreplaceable and their work is not absolutely dependent on Commission support. They are none the less hugely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country the best thing about Info-Points Europe is that they are where the people are. If the EU feels a long way off, they at least are not to blame. On the contrary, it is these very Info-Points that ease the situation. The EU Carrefours are in rural areas and the Info-Points Europe in regional libraries. It is easy for people to look for the information they want and so they do. For example, everyday in Finland people look for information on the draft EU Constitution in these places.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Members of the European Parliament, are often the ones the public consults on different issues. As, however, it is legislation that we deal with first and foremost, my own work has unquestionably been made easier by the fact that in many cases I can refer people with questions to the services of the Info-Points.</p>
<p class="contents">The turnout has been small at previous European Parliament elections. In Finland last time it was only slightly greater than 31%. Furthermore, many citizens of the European Union feel the new Constitution is a driving force behind a federalist-style Union and that the administration of the Union is drifting further and further away from grassroots level. We have to be able to allay such fears by increasing the amount of relevant information we provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I do not think it wise to reduce or announce an intention to reduce direct communication with the citizens of Europe. It is absolutely essential that the European elections reach the people through involvement in the voting on the part of the public media as well as the Union’s own organs of communication. The combined effect of this will be to get support for the notion of the people experiencing their own election and their own Union, and to establish the idea of a human European Union that is subject to the influence of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the course of this debate, the Commission has been described as discourteous, our action improvised, dysfunctional and laggardly. I guess in some ways the Commission provides an open target on which people can vent their complaints, especially when there is cause to believe that some difficulties have been encountered because of accidental <span class="bold"></span> not malevolent <span class="bold"></span> omissions. I would simply underline that there are those who will criticise the Commission when there is any doubt about our conforming as far as Union law is concerned. That is a political criticism we have to face. However, it becomes difficult to take when we make efforts to uphold the law and in response we are castigated for our inflexibility and dysfunctionality.</p>
<p class="contents">I know this House <span class="bold"></span> and certainly the people present at this debate <span class="bold"></span> understand the problems. To ensure that there is complete clarity on the subject <span class="bold"></span> something that did not come through in all the speeches <span class="bold"></span> I repeat: taking, if you like, Mr Bayona de Perogordo's suggestion that there should be a transitional approach, I would simply say that we have done rather better than adopt a transitional approach. We are not suggesting calls for proposals. We have an interim solution which is, as I announced, the waiver for 2004 <span class="bold"></span> although, obviously, we will require Council understanding and consent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Info-Points do not depend on us for survival. In most cases, and even under the original proposal to end subsidies, the Commission still offered to provide technical assistance in 2004 for those relays that wanted to avail themselves of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope no one will leave this debate with the idea that we are thoughtlessly and discourteously abandoning these critical information outlets, or the people who provide that service, to their fate. We are certainly not doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me turn to Mr Perry's comments, put with his customary delicacy and charm and all the more forceful because they were wrapped in silk and polished with scented soap. He could have quoted a number of other clichés, but they are only clichés because they are true. He missed out 'keep off the grass' and 'a miss is as good as a mile'. However, in this case it would have been quite legitimate and I fully understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole experience has been a real lesson in the handling of the transitional requirement that arises automatically when we are making very necessary but quite sudden changes in our management and financing relationships. I hope the lessons that we have learnt will be properly applied. I also hope that the interim arrangements the Commission has suggested will commend themselves to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
