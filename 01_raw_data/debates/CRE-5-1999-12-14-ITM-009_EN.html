<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I should like first to extend my group’s warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs. If we look back to where we stood at the beginning of the budgetary procedure, then we can see, in our view, just how far we have come during difficult, at times extremely difficult negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate the fact, Commissioner, that you too endeavoured to mediate in the difficult and, in the final analysis, unsuccessful budgetary conciliation, although the conduct of the Commission itself during this whole procedure was not, of course, without its contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, it took too timid an approach to the declaration in the minutes of the interinstitutional agreement and entered into international multiannual commitments while wanting to solve the financial problem for the year 2000 alone during the initial stage. That was too little as far as we were concerned. At the same time, we realised that Mr Prodi was already making preliminary plans up to the year 2006 – a decided lack of coordination, Mr President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, the question naturally arises in the wake of the decisions by the European Council as to what will happen in future with heading 7 of the budget? Should we not also review the financial perspective, given the option, the option dynamically pursued by the European Council, to enlarge the circle of candidate countries? No, what we in the European Parliament want is to retain international credibility and a serious budgetary policy in this budgetary procedure even when financing the new priorities. Parliament is conscious of its responsibility as part of the budgetary authority. President Chirac’s praise this morning with respect to the budgetary and supervisory function of the European Parliament emphasised this yet again. We do not want to repeat this year’s experience of acting as a repair shop, with a plethora of supplementary and amending budgets and transfers of appropriations!</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore say quite clearly to the Council: by failing to act this week, by failing to endorse the proposals tabled by Parliament under option 3, you have put us in a very difficult position and have pushed us almost to the limit of what we can do under the Rules of Procedure. Please do not do so again. We stand today by the offer made by Parliament as a symbiosis between budgetary discipline and the readiness to consider precise reductions rather than all-inclusive reductions, as you intended and, at the same time, to enter into and finance the necessary political priorities. I would also say on behalf of my group that if you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, are able tomorrow morning to table the written declaration which we have demanded, we are prepared to support and implement the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be perfectly clear on this: with the relevant declarations by the institutions, including on the question of the limited review of the financial perspective which we expect from the Commission by April, and the corresponding statements from the Council, you are all, to borrow an expression from the money markets, accepting a bill of exchange and anyone who fails to honour the bill will lose their credit rating. Hence, in view of past experience and in view of today’s discussion, a very clear warning to the Council: if we fail in the spring to reach an adequate solution for the multiannual programme for Kosovo and the western Balkans, combined with a corresponding commitment by the Council, you will end up in extremely dangerous waters as far as the budgetary procedure for the year 2001 is concerned. We here in Parliament want to avoid this. It is up to you to ensure that we get both the Budget 2000 and a reasonable multiannual programme to finance these priorities under way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Budget 2000 is the budget which will take us into the next millennium. It represents a gesture. It represents a gesture in terms of political content; but it must also be a gesture of how we should actually have to deal with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by saying that we as a Parliament must thank our two rapporteurs in this respect, with respect to the debate of the Budget 2000, for carrying out excellent work, for getting things under way which have been discussed at length in this House. I remember the new regulation in connection with the Technical Assistance Offices which Commissioner Schreyer referred to this morning. We had a meeting of the Committee on Budgets last week at which very clear commitments were entered into as far as the future is concerned, so that we can expect to make progress here and exercise control. We shall support you in a constructively critical manner on this question of the future development of the Technical Assistance Offices. As far as past experience is concerned, namely the proper deployment of appropriations, we have made a gesture by increasing OLAF staff numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made quite unequivocal gestures as far as one of the largest items of budgetary expenditure is concerned, namely agricultural policy. We want to break away from mere market price support and move towards rural development and additional appropriations will be provided in forthcoming budgets in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made it clear that only consumers are important in our Europe, which is why we have strengthened the Food Safety Agency, in order to make a gesture at this point, and we have entered relevant appropriations to make up for social weaknesses in the budget, so that progress can be made in combating unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">These are things which have been discussed in this Parliament with great unanimity and on which progress has been made on the initiative and with the support of our rapporteurs. The decisive point in this discussion or rather the point which caused us the most work and the most worry was of course the question of how to finance properly one of the greatest challenges facing Europe in the coming years? I refer of course to the Balkans and, more specifically, to Kosovo which will be targeted as a priority next year.</p>
<p class="contents">You can rest assured that we in this House will do everything to lay solid foundations. We made this very clear during the budgetary procedure. We are interested in having sound foundations so that we do not just lurch from one problem to the next, but so that we can work together on a solid basis for years to come, because the problem in the Balkans is not a problem which can be solved in a year. We have shown very clearly that we do not just want to demand more here; we also want to do our homework. We have made transfers in the budget, very specific transfers. We have not made any general reduction; instead we have said we will make reductions as and where possible. We have expressly made an exception for non-governmental organisations or aid programmes, such as those to combat AIDS in third world countries, which need all the support they can get. We have done all this with a great deal of unanimity. This also demonstrates how important these matters are to us. You have seen for yourself that there is a great deal of unanimity in every debate and in every vote in this House. Completely irrespective of our ideological backgrounds, we have conducted ourselves in a manner which must have made it clear to you that we take the matter and the manner of our dealings with each other very seriously indeed. And this will be our motto for the coming years. I must support Mr Böge all the way on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also endeavour in the future to create a basis of trust in our dealings with each other, a trust which was perhaps lacking at several junctures this year, both on our part towards you and on your part towards us. So we are holding out our hand, as Social Democrats and Socialists, as a sign that, if tomorrow morning you in fact table the declaration as described, we shall support it. And we shall ensure that there is a proper budget for the year which also offers a perspective. But we shall also work consistently towards ensuring in the coming years that again we do not lurch from one problem to another but that we have a serious plan on which everyone can build, especially those who really need the money. In other words those now living inside the European Union and those living outside the Union who have a right to our solidarity. We shall continue to do our homework in the future. We shall take our potential as a Parliament very seriously, on that you can depend. But we shall also make an effort to work more closely with you, so that we do not need, as in this year, to find a solution so close to the end of the year. When you have trialogues and conciliation, you should use them for their intended purpose so that compromises can be found before the eleventh hour.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on you to move towards us and we will move towards you. But, as we have said, you can be sure that we also know what we can do if we are trifled with! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was not easy this year. </p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson we can draw from this year’s budgetary discussion is that the Commission and the Council need to be careful about making statements in public regarding how much money is available for a certain cause without knowing how exactly it will be funded. This does not seem to bear repetition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to move on to the budget itself. Firstly, I would like to focus on the agricultural budget itself. Category 1 A. I question the benefit of the exercise which we started three years ago, the so-called ad hoc procedure that we would refer to the most recent estimates for the following year and establish the budget for compulsory expenditure accordingly. I can only note that the Council has adhered to July’s budget. The Council’s perspective is, of course, unique, but I fail to comprehend why one should always adhere to what one has established in July. I do admit that some shifting has occurred between different budget headings.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to category 1 B, I appreciate that the Council has adopted Parliament’s amendment in order to achieve a quality policy for European agricultural products. At a time when consumers are increasingly anxious about the quality of food, I think that this is urgently needed and therefore meets with my appreciation. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the other amendments in category 1 B, my group will support these. At a time of WTO negotiations, when everyone talks about a sound rural policy, it is positive that the European Union pursues an active policy in this field. </p>
<p class="contents">Then I would like to comment on category 4 of the budget, including Kosovo. Firstly, I think that Parliament has shown its goodwill by finding the necessary funding for Timor and Turkey within the budget itself. This has clearly been down to the Parliament’s goodwill. </p>
<p class="contents">Another noteworthy fact with regard to category 4 is that we have established that on 30 September of every year, a project surfaces which ties up about 10% of the money and then miraculously, two months later, around 100% of the money is allocated. How does this inventiveness come about so swiftly? Would it not be possible to space it out a bit more and, in this context, to take into account the Court of Auditors’ observation in this respect? </p>
<p class="contents">The group can agree with the method of financing such as it has been regulated provisionally for Kosovo. It differs quite significantly from the original amounts specified by the Commission. We look forward to establishing a new budget as soon as possible, should this prove necessary. The objective of my group is not to dash the financial perspectives as such. We are more than willing to discuss any well-defined proposals, provided they are accompanied by sound arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also awaiting the compromise which will hopefully materialise tomorrow regarding payment appropriations. My group is divided on this matter. According to some Members, the payment appropriation level should definitely be lowered. If I have interpreted the noises in this respect correctly, then this will also happen. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, Kosovo should not be the cause of an inter-institutional war. We should be able to solve this matter on the basis of arguments. Peace in the Balkans is worth a great deal to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first European budgetary discussion in which I am involved, and I must say that in my inexperience, I have grossly overrated the rationality employed to spend taxpayers’ money. The first party at which we can point the finger must surely be the Council of Ministers. They were so much more concerned with their own national purses than about the people in Kosovo that previous pledges were fiddled. </p>
<p class="contents">In Berlin, a protocol was concluded, on the basis of which financial perspectives could be adapted if so necessitated by the reconstruction of Kosovo. At two Conferences of Donors, the European Union committed itself to contributing EUR 500 million. According to a report by the World Bank, it is possible to absorb this amount. A frontload approach (a great deal of money in the first couple of years) is said to be the best way of kick-starting the economy. </p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 500 million are necessary, they have been promised and they can be found within the current budget. It is, however, necessary, so as to prevent developing countries from being presented with the bill, to use margins from categories other than foreign expenditure. There is, for example, a generous margin in category 1 B, rural development. Proposals to apply this margin and offer Kosovo prospects for the future, were not even considered by the Council. The hard lesson of the significance of conflict prevention, the Berlin Protocol, … rational arguments were discounted when the national ministers defended the agreements of Berlin selectively and undoubtedly worked out in the mean time how much unused funding from the margins they would recover at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Surrealism reached yet another level when negotiations were held regarding this couple of hundred million when Commission President Prodi committed the European Union to the tune of EUR 5.5 billion in political terms for the reconstruction of the entire Balkans. It is to the credit of the rapporteur that these statements did not remain airy fairy but were given substance in a declaration. I would explicitly like to extend a warm thanks to Mr Bourlanges for this. </p>
<p class="contents">This declaration has in the past couple of weeks been much deliberated and has even today created a lot of dust. I believe that this will be topic of conversation tomorrow and the day after that. It is a rather awkward situation. It is not exactly a model of a rational decision but rather a case of panic stations. I personally, for example, support Ajax but they manage to marry beauty, speed and tactics rather well.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is as yet unclear what exactly we will be voting on on Thursday, I will indicate which issues meet with agreement within my group. Firstly, until such time as figures are available regarding the needs in Kosovo, I will keep referring to the World Bank’s report and the EUR 500 million which have been pledged. I am prepared provisionally to discuss a maximum amount which is under this amount, but I would like to receive confirmation that the multiannual programme which is to be drafted in April, is to apply to the entire Balkan region, including Kosovo, and will run from 2000 to 2006, inclusively. If necessary, Kosovo should receive the whole share, even as early as the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the timeframe for allocating funds to Kosovo should also make it possible for the entire share to be spent wisely. To me, this means that April seems to be the ultimate date for reaching a decision. The timeframe, together with the possibilities of adapting the present budget, should this appear necessary in April, are therefore crucial to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like Mrs Buitenweg, I too am new to the budgetary procedure but, like everyone else, I know that any budget is, by definition, the expression of political will. Having seen the final propositions notified to us at the end of weeks of laborious negotiations between Parliament and the Council, I greatly fear that our political will appears, to say the least, blurred and wavering, especially as far as external action is concerned, which is the main bone of contention.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a marked gap between the Union’s loud proclamations of its ambition to play a more active role in the settlement of major international problems and the haggling which we are forced to engage in with government representatives when it comes to finding money to fund the new priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My group voted at first reading against any reduction in the appropriations allocated to old but still equally important priorities, especially appropriations allocated to cooperation with and the development of southern countries, in order to fund new expenditure. Robbing Peter to pay Paul has never been an indication of great political imagination.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore voted in favour of a reasonable review of the financial perspectives over several years and the proposal made by our general rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, went in the right direction, calling for a reasonable review of heading 4. My group therefore supported his strategy to make the Council face up to its responsibilities: either we were to obtain the funding which would allow us to honour our political commitments or we would have recourse to Article 272 of the Treaty, which authorises us to determine non-compulsory expenditure ourselves, albeit within strict limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made one concession after another, we are now back at square one and, in the name of the cast iron logic of the budgetary stability pact, we now have the following situation: firstly, estimates and financial requirements for the reconstruction of Kosovo which have mysteriously dropped from EUR 500 million – the figure put forward by the Commission, the World Bank, the Member States and the media – to 420 and then to some 300 million; secondly, a reduction in the appropriations which we voted for East Timor and for the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey; thirdly, cuts in appropriations for cooperation, food aid and aid to Palestine and the countries of the southern Mediterranean, the TACIS programme for eastern Europe and support for human rights and, lastly, cuts totalling some EUR 2 billion in payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is, without doubt, an improvement on the Council’s initial position but, even so, what would our responsibility be if we were to accept such a compromise? Let me quote just one example: tomorrow we are going to honour Mr Gusmão the head of the resistance of the people of East Timor. Shall we, at the same time, tell him that we agree to reduce reconstruction aid for his country by one third? That is why, Mr President, my group feels that this compromise is unacceptable and we are unable to back it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first concerns Kosovo. Kosovo has become, objectively, an important political message for the Commission – and quite rightly so – with the aim of relaunching the political proposal put forward by Europe on the international stage, in order to show that there is in fact a serious intervention by Europe, a Europe that is not just about the economy. We have all approved this political message, but right now, we are discovering that the funds, for their part, do not exist. My disapproval is aimed precisely at this type of behaviour, because the responsibility cannot be off-loaded onto the House for expenditure which should have been budgeted for. We do not agree, either myself personally or my delegation. I would like to emphasise this, so that we will not be given this responsibility in the future, a political responsibility that should not be seen merely in economic terms. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to emphasise the promise we were made not too long ago, at the start of the presentation of the budget, on administrative reform of the so-called TAOs. In my opinion, we might manage to find funds to allocate in the future for the various budget lines if we manage to carry out a fair reform meant to support the various departments which provide praiseworthy support, both on a personal level and for research. The reform must be carried out straight away, immediately following the adoption of this budget, in order to allow us to proceed to fair planning. If this is what happens, we will have the chance to intervene, to influence our economies and reach one of our objectives as MEPs: relaunching and developing our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you should know that this Parliament, which was prepared to say that the intergovernmental conference should be revised and make a multitude of demands, will tomorrow probably welcome the fact that you decided at Helsinki to allow us two observers, rather than two representatives, and that you wish to confine yourselves to matters which Parliament considered were absolutely out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be the same with the budget, Madam President-in-Office. Our rapporteur had the vision and the courage to bring us to the point where, for the first time, we were going to have an in-depth discussion of what we would consider fair. If you want to fund Kosovo, if you want to honour the somewhat hasty commitments which the President of the Commission entered into vis-à-vis this region, then give us the budget resources so that we can be responsible and consistent and give us the chance to revise the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What you are in fact doing is giving us a little and throwing some ballast overboard. You agree to give us a few minor flexibility instruments and, needless to say, this Parliament will be prepared tomorrow morning to discredit itself, to abandon the route which it had mapped out and which was the right one, in order to engage in confrontation with the Council on matters of principle. You stand to gain on this ground too. It is sad for our institution because once again it has shown that it does not have the other “b” word, it does not have the bravery to make this gesture and stand by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How is it that the Union budget is exempt from the discipline which Europe imposes on its Member States? I am happy to talk about the unusual nature of the European structure, but we must avoid having one sauce for the goose and another for the gander.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we forgotten that the same citizens finance both the national and the Community budgets? As always, the demand for efficiency has again been put to bad use in order to justify action by the European Union. I shall not refer to the political choices which have been made or the haggling which has formed the basis of the budgetary discussion between the Council and Parliament. We denounced them at the first reading of this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I make this point because we feel that this is a constant factor in Community policy. Agriculture is a perfect example. Agriculture was a hallowed common policy; it was the cement which held the European edifice together and today it is the main loser in the budgetary debate. We cannot accept that. This is the price which Europe is paying, once again, for its lack of consistency. The race towards world prices and increased yields have jeopardised what was most precious to us: the quality of our food and the survival of rural employment. Our quality of life is being sold off and this too will have to be paid for tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">These are priorities which we think should be financed, rather than increasing programmes which some of us at least find obscure. The President of the Court of Auditors yesterday drew the attention of this House to the, I quote, “persistence of the ‘spending culture’ within the Community, more concerned with the volume of expenditure than with its quality”.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, by wanting to do too much, Europe does nothing properly, which is why the French members of the EDD Group will be voting against this budget, which does not meet the expectations of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is happening because the interinstitutional negotiation has been very bad. We have debated the ancillary clauses while the Council was delaying the basic decisions. And now, when there is hardly any time left, we are negotiating with the clock stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">In May, this Parliament experienced a serious confrontation between those of us who wanted Agenda 2000 and the Berlin financial perspectives, and those who, for budgetary reasons and for reasons of domestic politics, did not want the agreement. In the end we approved it by a simple majority. But there was still Kosovo and a Council statement which contained a commitment to review the financial perspectives in category 4 for extraordinary reasons. A war in Europe is always an extraordinary reason, the most extraordinary of all reasons to justify a partial review of the financial perspectives. In this discussion Parliament has been more up to the job than the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the recourse to Article 272 was excessive, and would even have been counter-productive if it had been brought into effect. But it is also true that it is the extraordinary rigidity of the Council in negotiation which has led us to take this action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and simply, under the pressure of having to confront a high level of payments, the Council has performed a U-turn and now accepts what the Parliament requested in the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not have been simpler to accept these requests by Parliament beforehand and to have prevented all this last-minute panic, which does absolutely nothing for the serious and efficient image which the European institutions are supposed to have?</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this agreement and this commitment. Parliament is going to finance all its political priorities, including the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which is of prime economic interest to my country, Spain. But make no mistake: the commitment which we have all made is very serious and a disagreement on the part of the Council would have disastrous consequences not only for interinstitutional confidence but also for the 2001 budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to you, Council, to see to it that this does not happen, and remember that not even those of us who defended, defend and will defend the Berlin financial perspectives, could accept the ceiling on external actions not being raised, if the figures require it, in April of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is always the right thing to do but on this occasion it is genuine thanks to Mr Bourlanges, to Mr Virrankoski and an additional one on this occasion to Mr Colom for the work they have done in a very difficult procedure. I would also like to thank those people within Parliament who helped make this budget a success. Mr Bourlanges mentioned at our first reading the staff of the Committee on Budgets, the long hours they work, not only at nights but at weekends also, to make sure that we can function. Also thanks to all the political group staff. That includes Mr Westenbroek who sometimes gets right on my nerves but thank you to all those who have helped us get this far.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not lose sight of what is in this budget. We are talking about one issue which is how to fund Kosovo but there is a lot in this budget that we should be proud of, as Mr Walter and others have already reminded us.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time we were in a budget debate, I think, I saw the Council benches absolutely empty. This must be a very serious debate when I see the number of people who are here from the Council. If we put their numbers together, and the Commission numbers together, they probably outnumber the Members in this Chamber, which signifies that they are looking forward to something being said. Whether that be from our side or from your side, Madam President-in-Office, I am not too sure, but they are here to keep their eye on somebody.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to ask questions, Mr President, and I hope we can find a solution to them tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday when we voted in our committee we took a position which I, and I think the vast majority of our committee, are quite happy with. Let me say this: we have no problem. You do. And now you are looking to us to get you out of a problem. I do not blame the Finnish President at all. You have been quite honourable in your dealings with us. It is the ones behind you who have been giving you a lot of problems. We know that. Quite frankly, we have got into this mess and now we are being asked to bail you out.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me try and get some clarification on what you said in your speech, Madam President-in-Office. I have called a special Budgets Committee meeting for tomorrow at 9.15 a.m. or thereabouts when the votes are finished and we will vote on the Colom report and we will vote, if need be, on changes to Mr Bourlanges' report. But we need some clarification on some issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the Commission because within the text there are three declarations and the first is a declaration from the Commission. The original text had the figure EUR 5.5 billion which has been mentioned by Mrs Buitenweg. The Council has actually taken that figure out. I am asking the Commission to clarify that it is a figure of about EUR 5.5 billion we are talking about when we talk about the aid that is needed for Kosovo and the Balkans in the light of what President Prodi and Commissioner Patten said. So, some clarification is needed from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In category four, and before I request clarification there, when the President-in-Office mentioned help for places like Kosovo and East Timor, let me remind the Council that it did not put any money on the line for East Timor – we did. Even at the second reading it did not put money on the line – we did. If you had not agreed the EUR 125 million for Morocco – even before we had an agreement – we probably would not be in the position we are in now. But that is another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I need clarification on three things for our committee meeting tomorrow. We have had a chat about this, but I want to hear you say it here tonight. When I was noting down what you were saying, in English you said that the ceiling for heading 4 should not be amended permanently. You clarified that by saying: the words 'at this moment' should also be added. Let me try and simplify it. Can you confirm that in that phrase you are talking only about the year 2000? When you talk of no revision for category 4 being necessary are you talking only about the year 2000? That is the first thing we need to have clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing we need clarified is this: on the EUR 2 billion in payments of compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, can you confirm that this is the position of the Council – meaning the Member States and not just you? Can we assume that will not be challenged before we take our vote tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, can you produce in writing your position for our meeting tomorrow so that Mr Colom i Naval can make proposals? If we get those things clarified I think we can get the solution the Council is looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say one last thing. We all have to learn lessons from this and the one that the Council must learn more than anything else is, not to take Parliament for granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Greens, Mrs Buitenweg and I are both new to the Committee on Budgets and we had some difficulty settling in. But I must say that, in contrast to national politics, what is striking in Europe is that practical politics are not party political and the European Parliament is aware of its responsibility on material matters, a responsibility which was, of course, heightened or highlighted by the poor turnout at the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that we must present the citizens of Europe with a solid policy on the budget and on budgetary control and that we must ensure that both are efficient and transparent. I consider that the European Parliament has been successful on this point in these budgetary negotiations. I think that we leave these budgetary negotiations a stronger Parliament, in my view a very important point. The Council must finally get it into its head that there is one thing you cannot do and that is to take on more and more at European level without entering into serious negotiations with Parliament as to how these additional commitments are to be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">The matters at issue this year were not only Kosovo, East Timor and the earthquakes in Turkey. We all know that enlargement to the east was also an issue. We all know that the conclusions of Helsinki in relation to Turkey, and in relation to enlargement to the east in general, mean that we will be taking on even more sooner or later. That is why we need to fall back on serious negotiation as far as the budget is concerned and the Council can rejoice in the fact that this European Parliament has grown in stature and political awareness with its responsibility on budgetary matters. We shall ensure much more emphatically in the future that there is proper implementation of the budget at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We made it clear by a large majority that new political priorities must not be financed at the cost of other, unfinished tasks. The compromise negotiated between the Council and Parliament which lies before us today takes no account whatsoever of this basic position of Parliament. I seriously wonder where exactly the compromise lies, what justification we have for using this term. We are struggling for social justice in the world. That does not mean taking appropriations from the poor in one part of the world and giving them to the poor in another part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing appropriations for social tasks in order to fund foreign policy challenges is not a solution. A budget which is designed on such lines and which, moreover, does not even provide sufficient appropriations for the so-called new priorities, takes all our political declarations and resolutions to the point of absurdity. Parliament must therefore say no to this pseudo compromise. What is needed is the courage to draw the obvious conclusions from the development of European integration and to provide the EU with sufficient funds to carry out its tasks. It is high time that we really started thinking and acting as Europeans and establishing fully justified individual interests in this context. It is unacceptable to continue acting in this upside-down way in budgetary and fiscal matters. Parliament should stand firm on its demand for a review of the financial perspective. The financial room for manoeuvre needed to do so can be created within the framework of European Union decisions, namely by setting the use of own resources from gross domestic product at a higher level. If we want to stop patching things up every year, then we must turn our serious attention to the question of the reform of European own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would not be much if the money were not squandered in and, above all, outside Europe. In Europe, appropriations for the reconstruction of Kosovo would have been saved had we not destroyed Kosovo on the basis of alleged massacres ascribed to the Serbs as the OSCE has now admitted. Especially as we are redirecting EUR 110 billion allocated to rural development in order to finance Kosovo. In other words, we are robbing our own farmers in order to pay the Albanians in the name of the principle of “you first”. </p>
<p class="contents">It is as unhealthy as the fact that half our debates here this afternoon have been devoted to a province of the Serbian State which is not even a member of the European Union. It is true that, as far as the European budget is concerned, the worst offences are committed when we pour money outside the continent of Europe: EUR 10 million for Central Asia, EUR 14.5 million for the displaced people of Latin America, EUR 4 million for human rights in South Africa and Timor etc., etc. That would be all well and good if, at the same time, we were not planning to cut EUR 5 million from appropriations for our beekeepers who face competition from adulterated honey from abroad. </p>
<p class="contents">While we are spending money here, social austerity is being imposed in our 15 countries. Doctors and nurses in French hospitals, who are among the most qualified in the world, are today on strike because budgetary austerity has just cut back hospital expenditure and health expenditure. This situation is all the more disgusting in that, at the same time, we are paying EUR 45 million to ACP banana producers, some of which are American multinationals established in Cameroon and the Ivory Coast and which are being paid EUR 45 million under this European budget.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />This, then, is stupid spending on top of customer spending on top of ideological spending. It all adds up to a lot, it adds up to much too much and that is reason enough to vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But this is not in the offing as yet. Parliament and the Council have turned Kosovo into an affair of honour over the financial ceiling of category 4. This is taken to such an extreme that the rapporteur even threatened to include only EUR 115 million into the budget instead of the EUR 500 million which is required. If this were to happen, then the Kosovars would be the big losers. The only lifeline which then remains is a supplementary and amending budget later on in the year. But the negotiations for this budget will also be extremely difficult, especially if they are linked to a debate regarding a multiannual programme for the entire Balkans. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of key importance that a compromise is reached between the Council and Parliament regarding Kosovo before next Thursday. An agreement is within reach, especially now the Council seems to agree to a smaller reduction in the payments for the structural funds. </p>
<p class="contents">Alongside an agreement on Kosovo, the Council and Parliament will also need to agree, in time, on an aid programme for the entire Balkans. How can this be financed? The extent of the financial package for the external policy, as laid down in Agenda 2000, seems to suggest that the European Union, in this respect, only has a subordinate task. This is also true of the Balkans. Consequently, the Council’s attitude is one of ambivalence. On the one hand, it refuses to raise the financial ceiling for category 4 and this is only right. But on the other hand, the willingness of the Member States to contribute to financing the Balkans falls far below the mark. As a result, the European Union budget is stretched, which will have a detrimental effect on the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only have to think back to this afternoon and I must say in no uncertain terms that the situation is highly unsatisfactory and that we, the European Parliament, are now being more or less forced to circumvent our own Rules of Procedure in order to rescue and salvage what can be salvaged. I should like to repeat once again that the situation as a whole is highly unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory because – and this was also apparent at the Summit in Helsinki – we have a Council which blithely makes promises and then the budgetary authority, to which the Council also belongs, after all, then has to consider how everything can again be brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is the first budget which we are required to implement in accordance with the decisions taken in Berlin on Agenda 2000 and we are already in a situation in which these decisions, yet again, cannot translate the Council’s wishes in financial terms. More and more problems will arise in the coming years when everything decided in Helsinki – and I am thinking in particular of enlargement – finally impacts on the budget. So what I expect, and this has been addressed by previous speakers here this evening, is a bit more consistency between what the Foreign Secretaries decide and what the Finance Ministers decide. I think this can be established by each government in its own Member State, and that we can then find a joint solution to the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter which I would like to address is that of the Technical Assistance Offices, which have also played a special role in the past. We here in Parliament have already clearly shown where the responsibility lies and have proposed clear solutions. I should like to extend my particular thanks on this matter to the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, who has been firm in making clear proposals with the support of this House. If anyone has done justice to their responsibility in the procedure for Budget 2000, then it was the European Parliament. I should like to stress once again at this point: we cannot keep on moving hand over hand, as it were, from one budget to the next and from one crisis to the next; on the contrary, the Council must pave the way so that we can put an end to such problems once and for all!</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the small budgets are concerned, and here thanks go to Mr Virrankoski, we are on the safe side and everything is under control. I think that Parliament too, with its own budget, must do as it would be done by. That too is a very important point. I refer in particular to travel costs for officials on active service, another problem which requires an urgent solution, and all the other points which, in my view, we solved at first reading and which we can now clear up once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the question, if you will allow my immodesty. Rarely have there been so many supporters of a Colom report in the Council. I wonder where I am going wrong. The Berlin European Council was obsessed with budgetary cuts, and not only gave rise to a reduction in the funds for structural policies compared to levels reached in 1999, but also forgot that there were other Community policies. It appears that the Council deliberately daydreams about a European Union which will cost them nothing. After a struggle, in six weeks of Council-Parliament negotiations, we tidied up headings 3 and 5. But although we were negotiating while Kosovo was being bombed, the Council refused to adapt category 4 to something so obvious as the fact that, within a few months, the Union would be involved in its reconstruction, would have to provide humanitarian aid and would certainly have to compensate Romania and other countries, as well, for the losses suffered in trade on the Danube.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this a problem of short-sightedness. Apparently, the Council cannot tell the difference between the financial perspectives, the multiannual framework for the budget and the budget itself. To my mind, the Council is like one of those people whom you cannot ask to post a letter, because they cannot tell the difference between a letterbox and a drain-hole. Exact figures are requested for something that can only be estimated approximately. I took part in the negotiations and the Council’s only coherent argument is that we should not prejudice the Union’s negotiating position in the Conference of Donors. For this there was a proposal and it seems that we have adopted it and this is the solid position we have taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures are confused. The Commissioner spoke of EUR 500 million for 2000, on the same day that the President-in-Office of the Council spoke of EUR 12 billion for a period of seven years. This clearly has to be resolved. But we can wait, if necessary, for better figures, although we could make perfect use of the budgetary framework. I believe that there is a time for everything, but we could deal with this problem perfectly – and much better – by means of an amending budget I/2000. In that way we would also fulfil the wishes of the Council which aims for permanent budgeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I say this in the context of the perspectives that are being presented to us in the current phase of the process. I have no doubt that the latest proposal for a solution adopted by the board of the Committee on Budgets does not carry the negative burden from which the Council’s proposal suffers. Even so, it does not provide any grounds for enthusiasm and all the indications are that it might even be made worse by new, unacceptable commitments. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, and in the way this proposal for a solution was adopted, it can already be deduced from it that it is dropping the idea of a revision of the financial perspectives relating to heading 4 as well as the principle of new objectives being matched with new means. It is therefore and inevitably resulting in an extremely arbitrary cut under the same budgetary heading of a sum of EUR 150 million, which particularly affects food aid, cooperation, the Mediterranean and the TACIS programme. Apart from this, the ECO programme itself will also lose EUR 35 million in comparison to the first reading. </p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that we cannot be satisfied with this kind of solution and our vote will certainly reflect this. This is not a retreat by the European Parliament, but it will result in some priorities for the present financial year continuing to be paid for at the expense of previous objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall also add that this kind of solution will also reduce sums destined for some priorities that have already been stated, specifically for Timor, which has gone from EUR 30 million to EUR 20 million. We are obviously delighted that the heading that we proposed for Timor has been adopted and provided with appropriations, but as we stated at first reading, and now for even more reasons, we think that the appropriations earmarked for it are clearly insufficient. These are the reasons that cause us to see the present budgetary process as clearly unsatisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like to congratulate everyone on what has been achieved, because it was not an easy budget. I would like to say that category 3 and especially social employment policy were given a great deal of attention anyway in this budget. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, we have had to deal with a very chaotic procedure. My personal wish has always been to reach a statutory budget, one which could be signed by the President. It looks as if this might be feasible. Whether this is done via the plan proposed by Colom, to put it in these terms, so the budget as it was adopted by our Committee on Budgets, or via an agreement concluded at the last minute with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In both cases, we would have a statutory budget. This is, to my mind, the strength of this Parliament. We ultimately decide what the budget is going to be rather than some vague compromise or other. The Council can fall in with us and make a compromise, but we can establish the budget ourselves without the help of the Council. This is extremely important. </p>
<p class="contents">The issue has very much focused on Kosovo. The longer I am steeped in the issue, the more astounded I am by it. First of all, I am astounded by the ease with which ostensibly, representatives from Europe can pledge EUR 500 million just like that. Mrs Buitenweg stated that yes, these EUR 500 million have been pledged. Of course, it is not like that. They have been pledged by people who were not authorised to do this. If I wanted to pledge NLG 20 000 to Greenpeace and I said: deduct it from Mrs Buitenweg’s salary, then I think she would have something to say about that. The Commission has done exactly that. The Commission keeps bringing up these 500 million. Of course, one can refer to the investigations carried out by the World Bank but quite surprisingly, 500 million will remain the end sum, whoever commissions the investigation. Surely this is not very convincing. This is why I am so pleased that we have agreed with the Council on one point, namely the question that we investigate how much money is really needed, taking into account all aspects. Including the point whether the money volume in Kosovo will not rise too much. If you inject one billion into a country which has a GNP of 1 billion, it then begs the question whether this country can cope with it or not. Are we not doing something wrong here? </p>
<p class="contents">After the Second World War, we gathered a great deal of experience with the Marshall plan, in France, Germany and in the Netherlands. Top of the agenda always used to be the recovery of the economy and not just donating money without wondering about the consequences for the economy. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is extremely important that we ask the same question here. I think that the possible agreement with the Council will open up this opportunity and that we must welcome it. But please let us also question whether this Union can afford to let all kinds of representatives to distribute gifts abroad which at the end of the day cannot be built into the budget. We should keep questioning this. I regretted the fact that in the first instance, the Commission was unable to gather sufficient substantiating evidence. The Commission needs to do this. It cannot just accept anything and everything. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not forget that the priorities we are setting relate to important matters. We are investing in environmentally friendly agriculture, in the protection of animals and plants and in safe food. We are increasing our efforts in support of vulnerable groups and in the fight against poverty in Europe. We are investing in the fight against unemployment and, especially, in local employment initiatives. We are preparing for the enlargement of the European Union to include new Member States and we emphasise that this process must be given a broadly citizen-oriented dimension. The dialogue between the two sides of industry in the labour market must be extended to include the applicant States, and we want the Committee of the Regions to have the chance to develop a dialogue at local and regional level. I myself have tabled a proposal concerning a means of achieving decentralised cooperation around the Baltic. </p>
<p class="contents">In spite of setting these priorities, we have nonetheless succeeded in reducing our budget commitments. It was therefore naturally depressing that, as late as yesterday, we had not reached a final conclusion, despite the significant degree of essential unity. I personally have been hoping for a compromise all this time. We ought of course to be able to reach a compromise because, in my view, Parliament has already moved a long way in order to achieve this. We have set aside the position we had adopted on principle to the effect that we ought now, before the year 2000, to revise the budget ceilings. This is because the Council wants to add major new items of expenditure in connection with Kosovo, East Timor and Turkey, among other issues. </p>
<p class="contents">We have accepted large reductions in payments in spite of the fact that we already have a mountain of payments before us. It is not possible to decide upon major commitments year after year and then not, in fact, to pay out. In spite of our opposition to linear cutbacks in aid, we have agreed to make substantial reductions, but of a more targeted nature.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note here that there is not in fact any prevailing disunity on the subject of Kosovo. I am therefore pleased that the Council now seems to be coming back to Parliament and approving our proposals. The people of Kosovo ought not to continue to suffer because we cannot agree about the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, there is one more thing that is important. If we are going to cope successfully with the future, with the enlargement of the European Union and with developments in the Balkans over the next few years, then we must find a better way of cooperating. Let us learn from the debate we have now had. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of this responsibility falls to the European Parliament, specifically through the assessment that precedes the approval of the budget. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we do not limit ourselves to carrying out a series of formalities, without content or consequence, because that would entail the risk of reducing ourselves to a type of democratic alibi. This would be a betrayal of the citizens we represent. The message given at the discussion phase for the 2000 budget must then be taken seriously. The European Parliament wants the assumption of new responsibilities by the European Union to be matched by new financial resources. This applies to Kosovo, to the Balkans and to any budget heading. </p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense to maintain recourse to initiatives completely lacking in transparency, such as the under-budgeting of new commitments or of payments for them, or both, linked to linear cuts in old commitments or payments, the inevitable consequence of which is delays in both as well as dozens of transfers throughout the year. </p>
<p class="contents">If the problem is a result of the European Union system of revenues it appears that the solution must be to change the system of financing the European Union. I shall finish by referring to three situations which I shall continue to highlight: firstly, the intolerable delays in the fulfilling of payments relating to the implementation of the policy of cohesion. Some delays I am aware of result in the negation of the principle of economic and social cohesion. Secondly, there is also the support for the reconstruction of East Timor, because we have to adopt resolutions which draw attention to the situation there. Finally, we are right to award Xanana Gusmão with the Sakharov Prize, but at the same time, let us be aware that the EUR 20 million that the 2000 Budget has earmarked for East Timor merely represent the starting point. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope to see the commitments given to the outermost regions, identified at Amsterdam by Article 299(2) of the Treaty on European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was wrong to introduce cuts in agricultural and social expenditure and in external actions concerning third countries. New policies need new resources. A total reform of the financial perspectives is essential. Sadly, we failed to include appropriations for natural disasters in the budget just as we failed to allocate appropriations for the accession procedures of Malta and Cyprus.</p>

For the first time, women are in the majority at European level. My congratulations!</p>
<p class="contents">They say that new brooms sweep clean. We are facing a major problem. The Commission discussed and decided its employment policy 2000 today. The question which must be asked time and time again in connection with the budget is: how can we ensure that the employment situation in Europe improves? I think there is an urgent need to consider which budget lines can be used to create employment in Europe, which budget lines can be used to secure jobs and which budget lines destroy jobs. I think these considerations need to be analysed more seriously in research programmes and the necessary conclusions drawn from them.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important confirmation is the confirmation of the posts for OLAF. The fight against fraud must be a priority for us. We have noted that our budget is in fact about the same size as the fraud perpetrated in numerous cases. We are talking here, perhaps in inverted commas, about a few million, while several billions are being lost through fraud, which is why I see the creation of OLAF as being of prime importance. I hope that, with OLAF, we can manage to ensure that honest and decent people on the market will again be given a better chance, as will those who dutifully pay their taxes and help to ensure that our social system functions properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I too should therefore like to thank the members in particular for increasing the budget line for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises by 15 million euros. I think it is the right way forward, because this sector creates new jobs, presents the greatest growth and pays the most taxes. When we talk of giving, we should also think about what we will be taking. Small enterprises make a very special contribution here, which is why the START programmes and support programmes are particularly important, because they show that we sympathise with small enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also set aside 10 million for digital applications. This is the sector which will have the highest employment in the future. Commissioner Liikanen has told us that, up to the year 2002, some 1.2 million jobs will probably remain vacant in the multimedia sector due to a lack of training. That should give us food for thought. We should focus on the sectors in which we can earn money, the sectors which guarantee that the European Union too will have enough money in the future to be able to tackle the problems of this planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, he asked what I meant in my speech today when I referred to the category 4 financial framework. My almost exact words were that it was the opinion of the Council that the financial framework for category 4 should not be amended permanently at the moment. I was obviously speaking about the budget for 2000, in which the Council’s proposal for compromise involves the use of the flexibility instrument with regard to category 4. In the future, obviously, the Council will investigate all the proposals the Commission will make. Mr Wynn’s second question concerned the two billion cut in compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. The basic principle here is that the rules of the Council lay down that the President-in-Office represents the position of the Council and that, as the person to hold that position, I am therefore presenting the position of the Council and replying on its behalf. Thirdly, the document based on the compromise has now been sent to Parliament’s Secretariat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(I am not about to say what a permanent review is but as you were the one who said it, you should know what it means.) You said that the Council opposed a permanent review “at this moment”. “At this moment” does not mean a thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wynn asked you, Madam President-in-Office, if “at this moment” meant that the Council was opposed to a review of the financial perspectives for the year 2000, which would appear to us to be perfectly in keeping with the compromise which is being forged, or if “at this moment” meant something even vaguer?

To answer the question, it is the text which was negotiated and which you had before you at the last sitting on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wynn asked me a question about the figure of EUR 5.5 billion. At the OSCE Summit in Istanbul, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, addressed the political task in the entire region of the western Balkans for the period from 2000 to 2006, announcing that the Commission was considering a sum in the order of EUR 5.5 billion as the support needed. You, the Parliament, have now called on the Commission to submit specific estimates for this region and this period in the form of a multiannual plan. We are working on this. I would ask you not to make any preliminary commitments but to bear in mind that the Commission must submit a precise and specific estimate for this period and this region which can and, of course, will then be checked by the Committee on Budgets or rather the budgetary authority and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by saying that the debate this evening has illustrated once again that the negotiations were difficult. The Commission appreciates the efforts made by Parliament, and the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets in particular, and the efforts made by the Finnish Presidency of the Council. But I think that, if the result is a good one, then the effort will have been worth it and I hope that a good last-minute solution really can be found tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
