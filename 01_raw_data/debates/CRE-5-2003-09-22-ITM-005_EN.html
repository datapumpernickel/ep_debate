<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sterckx (ELDR),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the many Members who contributed to this report. I would like to thank everyone who provided us with information during the hearings in Parliament and during our visits to Galicia and Brest, but also all those people who spontaneously sent us information by email or by letter, or who sent us entire files. All these cases were very interesting and they helped us a lot.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear, however, that the intention of this report is to improve safety at sea as much as possible. That is the only thing we were working on. First of all, we had to find out as much as possible about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> in order to learn lessons from it. We then had to go through all the regulations, both European and international, in order to see where we could make improvements. It is clear that the Commission did not wait for our conclusions, although we had enough contact with the Commission during our work. Suggestions were made, and I think that the Commission worked quickly and well in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">What went wrong with the accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>? One of the initial conclusions of the report was that there were no safe havens in the area where the accident happened. For me this is one of the two most important conclusions. The ship was moved away from the coast, and by moving the ship away from the coast they made the consequences of the accident, at least in geographical terms, more serious than they otherwise might have been.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erica II</span> package contained a guideline on safe havens. If we had applied this, the whole thing would probably have looked different. I am pleased that the handling of the system of safe havens has been accelerated. I hope that there will be a proposal for compensation very soon – the Commission has in fact promised that. We are also asking for clear management structures – and this is very important – for safe havens. The Member States had to report on the system in their countries by 1 July. As far as I know, they have in fact all done that. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to give its opinion on the quality of the documents it has received. What are they like? Would this have made cases like the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> less serious? Are we now establishing an effective system? That is the first question I have for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another lesson I certainly learned from what happened to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is that we have to inspect old ships better. Either we have to take them out of service if we think that they are dangerous, or, if we think they are still OK, we must check them very thoroughly to establish whether they are in order or not. If all the reports are to be believed, in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> the inspection of one or both of the ballast tanks was certainly not performed entirely according to the rules. I think that it is important for us to also cross-examine the classification company and ask them whether they might not be able to tighten up their rules on that point. It is not sufficient to only look at the state of a ship at a particular point in time and inspect it every so many years. We also need to look at the way in which the ship is used. In the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, there may have been a problem with the ship being used as a mobile reservoir, and that could have weakened the ship’s structure. This was not taken sufficiently into account as it was not in the rules. We must make sure that this kind of thing does not happen again in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One solution we have put forward – or at least a decision that was taken very quickly – concerns the decision to allow the sort of material that was being carried in the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> to only be carried in double-hull ships. I agree with that in principle, but we must not regard this as some kind of miracle solution, as new questions are arising in connection with double-hull ships. What happens to double-hull ships when they get old? At the moment, all the ships are still new and everything works perfectly, but will these ships still be OK when they are 20 or 25 years old? Some specialists do in fact say that there will be problems with rust and weakening. The same things that happened to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> can also happen to double-hull ships. We must watch out for that very carefully. I would like both the classification company and the Agency to monitor that properly. We also have suggestions for tightening up port state control and we have suggestions for following up the guideline on monitoring properly. There are so many things in the report and I cannot go into detail about all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to handling emergencies, I think that it would be a good thing if we were to have a proper European coastguard. I also think – and I think that the Commission's proposal is a sound one – that there should be an anti-oil pollution fleet that is managed by the Agency. We must not forget, however, that there is a great deal of expertise in the sector itself at the moment, and we must not duplicate the effort. We must make use of existing expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">What I also find important is that there should be an independent body that investigates accidents in the maritime sector like the one in the aviation sector. At the moment it is particularly unclear who is undertaking such investigations. There is always somebody who is party to a case or who has submitted a claim or who must pay damages. There is never a higher, impartial body that investigates exactly what has happened. There is such a body for the aviation sector, and I think that there should be one for shipping too.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, Commissioner, and I assume you are in agreement with me on this, that the role of the European Union in the international organisation must be strengthened. The Commission should actually be a member of the IMO and put its full weight behind it so as to ensure that we never act in disarray again. I do not think we have a major difference of opinion about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The freedom of shipping is not absolute. A coastal country must be able to take action against a ship that forms a threat. If it is necessary to amend the international rules for this, then we must do so. We must ensure that safe havens are made compulsory in the IMO. We must regulate shipping in congested and sensitive areas. We must do that better than we are currently doing. It makes no sense to automatically tow ships 200 miles offshore, as this does not reduce the risk. This will not make the ship any better, and it will not make a bad crew any better, but the ship is further away so we think that the situation is safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you are being particularly strict; I hope that you will give me a bit more time. We must be able to exercise better control over flag states. We must pay more attention to the quality of crews. We must not criminalise the captain. This is important. This man is still under house arrest and must report to the police every day. I would like to call on the Spanish authorities to take another look at this case. In my opinion, and, I hope, in the opinion of most of this Parliament, this man is not a criminal, but he is being treated as one.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the wreckage. There is confusion about this. There is much less oil on board than we thought. I have just received information from the consortium under the direction of REPSOL that is carrying out the work. There is still 14 000 tonnes on board, 13 300 in the stem, 700 in the stern. The central tanks, which we thought were still full, do not contain any more oil, just water. The difference between what we thought in January and what we now think is not the result of leaks but probably came about because more oil was lost when the ship broke up in the disaster. Preparations are continuing. As the leaks are small, no oil will be brought up to the surface this coming winter; this will be done in the spring.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two more things I would like to say, if you would allow me, Mr President, and I thank you for your indulgence. I have asked for a separate vote on a number of paragraphs, because some things have been duplicated in the report. I hope that my fellow MEPs will be able to follow me in this. I made compromises on seven subjects; I am not going to list them, but I would like to ask everyone to look at them and to endorse them, otherwise we will end up with a document that is much too long.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is the temporary committee this Parliament would like to appoint to examine at this matter in more depth. I note that there is broad agreement on the principle. Both my fellow Members on this side and those on the other side of this House have submitted an amendment concerning the establishment of a temporary parliamentary committee. The argument is about its mandate. I will try to find a compromise tonight or possibly tomorrow morning. If I am not able to do so, I hope that this report will not be allowed to bite the dust on account of this, as only one of the 108 paragraphs is about the temporary committee. The other 107 are about safety at sea, and that is what we are dealing with here.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the current situation as regards the fight against marine pollution. It is important to note, Mr Sterckx, that before the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, there was the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, and in the same way there was no safe haven then to provide shelter for a vessel in difficulty. Unfortunately, too, before the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> there were many other cases where not only was there no safe haven, there was no political will, either on the part of this Parliament or the Council, or on the part of anyone, to adopt measures that would prevent what happened with the <span class="italic">Erika</span> or the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. That is the first thing that must be said.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the measures we proposed known as the ‘Erika I and Erika II packages’ have been approved, with the exception of the European Compensation Fund for Tanker Pollution. Nonetheless, progress has been made on this last point over the last months and years, thanks to the impetus provided by the Commission – with the support, it must be said, of the EU members of the International Maritime Organisation – to ensure that the maximum ceiling of the IOPC Fund is increased to EUR 920 million, which more than triples the current fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Erika I and II packages, other proposals were put forward by the Commission just after the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and they are at present being examined by the Council and Parliament. I must point out, however, that one of these has already been adopted and will enter into force 20 days after its publication, which should be at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. This proposal requires the use of double-hull oil tankers for the transport of heavy fuel oil and calls for an acceleration of the timetable for the phasing-out of single-hull tankers. In my view, if this had been proposed and implemented after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, we could have prevented the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident.</p>
<p class="contents">The result, ladies and gentlemen, is that we cannot rest on our laurels because, regrettably, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident was not prevented after what happened with the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. However, we can say something very important and that is that this time we have taken decisions, this time we have acted. That is the major difference between what has happened on other occasions and what is happening now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is indeed watching and monitoring the implementation of the measures we have adopted, in other words it is following the actions of the governments of the Member States and adapting them to what has been adopted. In that respect, I must tell you that we have had to initiate 10 infringement proceedings against 10 Member States that have not sufficiently incorporated the new provisions on monitoring by port state control and by classification societies. This in fact relates to two of the key elements in resolving this issue: port control, which thus enables prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation on the ground, the Member mentioned that various methods of recovering the oil still inside the wreck are being considered and that, according to the two formulas that exist, the competent authorities will adopt measures in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the beaches affected have been cleaned. This does not mean, however, that there are no longer spillages from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> floating in the sea, in particular around Vizcaya, along the Atlantic coastline, which move with the currents and the winds and can result in pollution along any European coast at any given time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer briefly to some of the points raised by the honourable Member. He asks what went wrong, and he replies that there was no safe haven. I think that before the lack of safe haven something else went wrong: a vessel in a poor state of repair was sailing through dangerous seas. Then, after that mistake, we found ourselves without a safe haven, just as there was no safe haven in the case of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident but, much more seriously, just as there was no safe haven a month and a half later in the case of the <span class="italic">Vicky</span> accident, when we faced another dangerous situation. Thank God it was not a major disaster, but this was purely because the sea was calm and there was the possibility of decanting the cargo on the open sea, not because we had a safe haven available to shelter a fuel-laden vessel in difficulties, a little more than a month and a half after what we had experienced with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is absolutely vital that we establish safe havens and establish emergency plans to shelter vessels in difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Member States made the political commitment to send those plans to us by 1 July of this year, although legally they have until February of next year. They have all responded, although inconsistently. They refer to different interpretations of the Community regulations. What was said here, what was discussed and what was decided upon within the Council of Ministers and this Parliament was extremely clear: they must, at a given time, provide a safe haven, a place of refuge for a vessel experiencing difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently assessing the plans drawn up in accordance with the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation and at the next Council I intend to raise this point with the transport ministers and tell them that if they have not fulfilled what the Commission considers to be the requirements in the approved text by 5 February 2004, we will certainly initiate infringement proceedings against those states that do not demonstrate full compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are going to require in all cases, as we are doing now, full compliance with the regulations currently in force and transposition of the regulations into the various national legislations.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions we have talked about the need to improve maritime safety and the European Union’s capacity to intervene in cases of serious accidents or pollution. To this end, there are the proposals to make changes to the Agency in order to broaden its remit; there is the proposal, and I want to thank Parliament for the support it is going to give us in principle, for the Agency to have resources available, specifically anti-pollution vessels that can operate in rough seas and that are not obliged, as in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, to stay moored due to the size of the waves but can operate in waves of over four metres.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the EU’s presence within the IMO is absolutely vital, as pointed out by the good Member. We are calling for a negotiating mandate for the full incorporation of the European Union in the International Maritime Organisation. On that basis, we want to work, together with the Member States, to promote safety standards, to see to it that flag states take greater responsibility and to ensure better protection of coastal states.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Parliament on the support it has lent us and continues to lend us over the years with regard to this matter. I feel that the outcome is important. Once and for all, the European Union has decided to face these problems rather than just waiting for the next disaster along our coast. We are working in the post-<span class="italic">Prestige</span> period, as I have said, but even next year we will put forward new proposals to improve port controls and to strengthen the Directive on the monitoring of maritime traffic, with a view to introducing a harmonised European traffic information and management system. We are also already in talks with our neighbours, for example the Russians, on issues such as this, the establishment of a legal framework for investigations following accidents and the application in the European Union of minimum criteria for flag states.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for the work you have done and would like to point out that as regards the issue of crew, there is the aspect of safety where a crew does not speak the same language: safety in an extreme situation is seriously compromised when orders cannot be given or received adequately. This is something we are looking at and we have proposed some measures to this end. Once more, ladies and gentlemen, I hope I can count on your support to help us to continue to make progress in this area.</p>

<p class="contents">At the same time, we would like to point out that, in addition to repairing the environmental damage and maintaining the aid for all those individuals and companies affected by the oil slick in the fisheries, seafood and aquaculture sectors, we must ensure fair compensation for all of the social and economic damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident in the other industrial sectors affected, such as canning, commerce, transport, hotel and catering, tourism, etc. To this end, we call for the mobilisation of all Community funds and technical resources, without exception, for the adoption of the supplementary fund for compensation for oil pollution damage and for further budget resources for environmental impact assessments, compensation for losses not covered by a current international agreement, the creation of a network for the exchange of experience in the field of hydrocarbon pollution, emergency action plans, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these purposes, allocations of funds made to Objective 2 or other regions must have the same level of Community co-financing as Objective 1 regions, thus avoiding imbalances in treatment that would be unjustified in the case of damage caused by agencies outside the actual areas affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We also request that the ban on the entry into EU ports for single-hull vessels carrying dangerous cargo be extended, by the creation of a specific EU law, to ships in transit through Community waters, as is the case in the United States. With what has been agreed up to now, we would not prevent a situation like the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note, I want to condemn the fact that the most effective operations to recover fuel in the high seas, carried out by the Basque Country’s fishing fleet, are to date the only operations in the entire Spanish State not to have received the aid provided for in the Community Regulation. I trust that this discrimination will not continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not delay in establishing a temporary committee to examine in greater detail the causes and consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident and propose effective measures to prevent disasters like this in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Other colleagues will no doubt refer to other aspects of the regulations governing maritime safety, as the Commissioner herself and the draftsman did. I am going to look at it from the point of view of health at work. I would highlight the need for continuous efforts in the area of health and safety at work, including the promotion of a culture of prevention and of the maritime professions. The training of seafarers – including the issue of a common language, Commissioner – is essential for improving maritime transport safety and preventing accidents. I would point out to the Commission and the Member States the need for a reform of international maritime law that deals with matters such as health and safety at work and the requirements of contemporary maritime transport. I would highlight the very serious harmful consequences now and for the generations to come of the ‘anything goes’ policy and the lack of scruples of businessmen and organisations motivated solely by profit. We must establish effective and sufficiently demanding regulations, which must be complied with in real terms and not just formally, which will prevent negative environmental, social and economic consequences and maybe, just maybe, the loss of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in addition to thanking the members of the Committee on Employment for their unanimous support for the opinion, I want to reiterate my gratitude to the seafarers, fishermen, volunteers and all those who have fought with great determination to combat pollution and support the environment and fisheries resources. Naturally, I would also like to thank the authorities in my country, who made every effort and took great pains to avoid more serious damage and who, in particular, are working through the ‘Galicia Plan’ to repair the damage caused and, since the very serious <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, revitalise the area affected and Galicia as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we thank you for your political will, reflected in decisions, and we encourage you to continue with your work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Isler Béguin (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to ask what purpose the enhanced Hughes procedure serves. Since this report comes under the enhanced Hughes procedure, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism should normally have drawn up opinions according to the same procedure. This is not the issue we are here to discuss, however. It will be decided during another debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, I can say that rarely has society witnessed such a heated, intense debate as the debate on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. Ultimately, here, we are somewhat removed from the disaster. The effect of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster on Galicia really was similar to that of an electric shock, and it had the same impact on France and Europe as a whole. Nobody, no citizen, failed to be moved by the disaster, especially after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster in 1999, when we in this Chamber said ‘Never again’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we must answer some questions to which a response has not yet been given. For instance, we know how it happened but we do not know why it happened. We do not know why the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> was towed out to sea, and the citizens asking this question have the right to know the answer. Parliament and the Commission, however, reacted very quickly. We called for a committee of inquiry to be set up, a proposal which was rejected by the majority of the House, and so we have a report instead, with this enhanced Hughes procedure which, I regret to say, seems not to serve much purpose. Nevertheless, very thorough work has been carried out, with a high level of cooperation between the different contributors and the different Members. On behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I myself, generally alongside the rapporteur, have taken part in all the initiatives which have produced this report, which is relatively exhaustive, the Committee on the Environment having focused on the issue specifically from the point of view of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore concentrate on four points, four of the Committee on the Environment’s demands:</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the priority of recovering the fuel oil. It is unthinkable that we should let 13 000 tonnes of fuel oil seep out drop by drop: that would be to turn a blind eye to a hidden oil slick which would continue to pollute our coasts for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the rehabilitation of areas of unspoiled nature. We call for the enforcement of the Habitats Directive and for the proposed Natura 2000 sites to be adopted immediately, and for resources to rehabilitate areas of unspoiled nature, the coasts, the seascape and marine life.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of volunteers, Mr President, is also extremely important. We call for an epidemiological study to be carried out on the communities to find out whether volunteers should, indeed, continue to collect fuel oil or not in the event of a problem, etc. I will not go through the entire list of points, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, in particular, to draw your attention to tomorrow’s vote. With regard to tomorrow’s vote, it is not a question of opting for the wrong committee of inquiry: we are calling for a temporary committee that will discover the whole truth and tell us what should and should not be done in the event of a disaster. It is a genuine decision-making aid, a tool to help decision-makers that we are calling for with the temporary committee. A committee on the enforcement of the Erika I and Erika II directives would not be able to tell us these things or bring progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like, if I may, to go back over a number of points made in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. First of all, the oil must be retrieved, even if there is less of it. The security of fishing depends on it. Secondly, where the blame lies: seafarers, like everyone else, want to understand how it could have happened. Tomorrow, when we vote on the question of the temporary committee, we must hope that it will help us to understand what happened and to see where France and Spain respectively were to blame. Thirdly, Commissioner, fireboats will have to become pollution-fighting ships. In the event of future accidents, we will need a fleet which can retrieve the oil or petroleum swiftly. Fourthly, with regard to the shipping corridors advocated by the report in order to organise shipping navigation along the same lines as air navigation, I think everyone in the fishing world will support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the question of technical harbour inspections, which are a source of concern to all: I believe that we need to look at social controls and at some kind of work inspection. Indeed, we must not forget that maritime safety and legislation are there, first and foremost, to protect the lives of the seafarers on board, whether they are fishermen, traders or employed in another form of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, whom I should like to congratulate, and by all the rest of us in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has demonstrated that the problem we are examining, safety at sea, is a complex, difficult issue with numerous aspects. That is why a range of measures covering numerous sectors is being proposed and I too should like to refer selectively to certain of them, because I think they deserve comment.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-pollution fleets and the European Coastguard are issues which need to be examined by the Commission and the Council. The fact that double-hulled ships are not a panacea is a finding which needs to be stressed and the safety of these ships also needs to be examined.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax incentives for returning ships to Member States' flags are also a particularly important factor, because in this way we can limit the number of ships sailing under flags of convenience. The need for there to be, at long last, as in aviation, a <span class="italic">lingua franca </span>in shipping between seafarers and everyone else involved in the sector and the finding in the report, that seafarers must not be made the scapegoat in the event of a shipwreck, are issues which also need to be underlined, for my part at least. Similarly, particular note should be taken in the report of what our committee is calling for, namely for there to be independent committees of inquiry in the event of a shipwreck, so that there cannot be different expediencies in investigating the causes and, of course, something which Parliament has noted for a long time, namely the need for both the Member States and the Commission to take specific action within the International Maritime Organization so that it becomes more active.</p>
<p class="contents">This – and much more besides – is noted in the Sterckx report, but so is something else: the fact that there is a problem with the application of legislation which has already been passed. Before moving on to the measures which we propose for the future, we note that there is a problem in numerous countries when it comes to respecting Community legislation. For example, there is a problem with the disposal of waste in ports. There is Community legislation which is not being respected by at least five Member States. The Commissioner herself referred to ports of refuge. Here too, the Member States do not appear to be complying directly with requirements which they themselves set. There is a problem with port controls. There is a problem with compliance on the part of certain Member States with the requirements of legislation on shipping registers. There is a problem in the Council itself in relation to a regulation we are now discussing in our committee on criminal sanctions in the event of shipwrecks. The Council called for us to proceed in this direction and it would appear that the Council is going to come along shortly and say to our rapporteur, Mr Pex, that it is not prepared to discuss this sort of regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, looking at this, much of which came to light after the report had been voted in committee, our political group wishes to raise the issue of the temporary committee which will come and look at the application of legislation, especially the Erika Ι and ΙΙ packages, at European level. We need to see why legislation is not being applied and to stress to the Member States that they must move in this direction as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the purpose of our amendment and I should like to call on all the political groups to vote for it, because any other amendment focusing specifically on the question of the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>does not, I think, constitute the regulation which needs to be adopted within the framework of this report. First, because we have already examined the question of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. What will we have to say that is new? It is as if we are cancelling the work of the rapporteur himself, Mr Sterckx, and of our committee as a whole. Secondly, because any committee of inquiry will create a legal problem. It is not officially called a committee of inquiry. It is called a temporary committee but, as it is examining the causes of the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, it becomes a <span class="italic">de facto </span>covert committee of inquiry and, consequently, it raises a legal problem because judicial proceedings are under way in a Member State and this contradicts the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. And thirdly, we need to keep our eye on the ball. To see the wood, which is safety at sea, not the tree, which is the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. If we keep on insisting on the issue of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, we shall simply transfer the internal Spanish dispute to Brussels and Strasbourg. And I do not think that does honour to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also pay tribute to our rapporteur for his hard work on the production of a well thought-out, highly considered, fair and balanced report. This report highlights the many failings of a number of authorities and yet comes forward with some positive ideas on how we can avoid a repeat of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mrs Miguélez Ramos will no doubt highlight the effects that this disaster has had and continues to have on the Galician coast. She, above everyone, knows the heartache that this disaster has caused and I pay tribute to her tireless efforts on behalf of the people of Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">So many other questions have been raised by the Sterckx Report that my Group and I believe that further work is necessary. Further investigation into the events surrounding the loss of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is needed. There should be further analysis of the economic and ecological disaster that has not only occurred but continues to occur for the people of Galicia and other areas. Furthermore, there should be an analysis into the adequacy of present EU maritime regulations, present IMO regulations and the actions – or perhaps, more appropriately, the lack of action – of some of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the PSE Group, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group have consistently called for a committee of inquiry. Because of the excellent work of Mr Sterckx and by way of a compromise, we can now drop that demand in favour of a request to the Conference of Presidents for a temporary committee to carry on the work of Mr Sterckx and to find the answers to the questions that he and others have posed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the least we could do for the people of Galicia and other affected areas. I support the rapporteur's call for such a committee in his Amendment No 11. Anything less from this Parliament would be an abdication of our responsibilities and a total abandonment, not only of the people of Galicia, but of the whole population of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We on this side of the House are not prepared to let that happen. We are prepared to back Parliament's rapporteur and look to the other side of this House to do the same. The time for political posturing is over: it is now time for action.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make our position clear, in light of the rapporteur's final conclusions in his speech concerning the issue of a temporary committee: it is 'no' to any dilution of Amendment No 11 and it is 'no' to any alteration to a future temporary committee's remit.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 is balanced, needed, well-supported and gets to the heart of the problem. To dilute or alter it would be unacceptable and a move born out of political gerrymandering, not a move in favour of maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this makes the PSE's position on Amendment No 11 crystal clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Initially, we already had good cooperation in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and it now looks as if we can find social support for this. The preparations proceeded practically and effectively: people went to Galicia and also to other places to gather information. Information from the people on the ground. Information from people who have been thinking about these issues for longer than we have here in Parliament. I sincerely hope that the support we have received in our committee will be reinforced tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step is naturally for the European Commission to build on this and for the Council of Transport Ministers to provide the necessary support. There is still one point which I am worried about and which I have set out in Amendment No 10 together with the rapporteur. It concerns the problem ships that have been banned and phased out in Europe. We want these single-hulled oil tankers out of service sooner than the IMO currently considers necessary. We should not allow these ships to automatically end up on the shores of poor countries and people without facilities to dismantle these ships, with all the associated risks. It would be inexcusable if the higher European standards were to result in potential environmental damage because we do not want to face the problem. The oil tankers we do not want here any more must not end up on the beaches of the Far East in large numbers. The pollution this will cause will be anything up to several times greater than the pollution caused on our own coastline by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. It is my conviction that Europe should introduce a maximum life span for ships. This would require European shipowners and European flag states to dismantle their ships properly. In my amendment I ask the European Commission to examine whether this is feasible in the short-term on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she will express her support for this. I even have concrete indications that environmental protection and economic considerations are running in parallel in this matter. The business sector is already formulating initiatives to give concrete content to the chapter on ‘corporate citizenship’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that we do not stop after today but that we keep going so as to prevent disasters from occurring more frequently both inside and outside the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This detailed report by Mr Sterckx, to whom many thanks for his excellent work, provides a first-rate basis on which to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as a whole have attempted, with great care and thoroughness, to give sober and objective answers to the questions as to the causes and consequences of the disaster and the lessons to be derived from it. I lay such weight on that in view of the past political campaign waged by many Members of this House with the objective of getting Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry. I am able to say today that, despite all the differences of political opinion in the committee, our real and overriding concern was to bring the facts to light and, above all, to come to the conclusions that are needed if we are to avoid such a disaster repeating itself. It was quite remarkable how the Spanish officials, when they appeared before the committee, appeared to misread how things stood in this House and to believe that they did not need to cooperate actively with us in our work. This attitude had changed by the time of the on-the-spot visit in Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur nonetheless – and I quote from his explanatory statement – comes to the conclusion that ‘a number of fundamental points remain to be clarified or are the subject of contradictory testimony’. He also points out that various investigations into the precise cause of the disaster, and into the question of who was responsible for it, are still in progress. These observations were made in mid-June, when the report was being completed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, several months have elapsed, and new details have become public knowledge, including the fact that the Spanish and the French consulted each other on what was to be done with the stricken vessel; the contradictions in the statements by the Spanish authorities about the quantity of oil disgorged by the wreck and the original quantity of oil that the tanker was carrying; analyses of the effects of oil pollution on the environment and initial assessments of the social and economic consequences after the summer break. These confirm what we had feared about the provisional nature and consequent inevitable incompleteness of the Sterckx report’s recommendations and conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">It was for this reason that my group decided to demand that the results of the inquiry be updated, and joined with the other groups in tabling the motion for the setting up of a temporary committee in this House, although we knew full well that there is little time available for this. This House’s political responsibility demands that, if we are to come to the right conclusions for the future, we must do so with the greatest possible clarity and in full knowledge of the causes, and this can only happen if we act on a joint basis, with close cooperation at national and European level.</p>

The <span class="italic">Nunca Máis</span> movement, which incorporates seamen, volunteers and local authorities from Galicia, is genuinely an admirable response and I believe that the response from the rapporteur and from this Parliament to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> problem is, for the time being, in line with this democratic rebelliousness.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we must remember that six very serious accidents occurred in Galicia in the last 30 years, that, in spite of this, no measures were taken, as they were after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident, and that, once again, there were no emergency plans and there are still no emergency plans. I must point out that if a vessel like the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> were to sail past Galicia now, exactly the same disaster would occur because there have been no changes that prevent these types of vessels from sailing in Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr President, is better than we could have hoped. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, and all those who have worked on this document which is better than hoped for, despite the obstacles encountered, by this Parliament as well as in Galicia and in the Spanish State. In any case, it is an important step forward in resolving the chaos surrounding international maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The document seriously criticises the behaviour of the Spanish authorities – which I believe is appropriate – and even more serious criticism is required of the chaos surrounding international maritime transport, the International Maritime Organisation, the states involved and the major companies, the international transport mafias.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must continue this work. To this end, our group and I, myself, approve of the amendments concerning the creation of a temporary committee to examine in detail the causes of this problem and resolve future problems. We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight a few issues: the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> problem has still not been resolved one year later. The fuel oil is still reaching the beaches. I am sorry to contradict the Commissioner, but oil is still reaching the Galician beaches – and particularly those in Cantábrico – and there are even very substantial layers of oil below the sand itself. We still do not know how much sludge is contained in the ship and the long-term consequences have by no means been resolved. Studies indicate that it will take 10 years to repair the damage and that investments of EUR 3 billion to EUR 5 billion will be required to remedy the situation. It is also essential to bring order to the chaos in international maritime traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say that it is all too clear that there is a political conflict within the European Union itself. The Commission’s behaviour, which I have praised, is not always mirrored in many of the Member States, and in the European Parliament there are conflicting positions, some which are in favour of resolving this problem and some which are not. We need European legislation – like the legislation in the United States – as a condition for resolving the entire international maritime traffic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is fair to say here that the European Maritime Safety Agency must be situated in the country that was most affected by the disasters. It is also fair to say here that it is essential to resolve the situation of shipyards such as Astano in Galicia or Izar, which are prohibited from building civil vessels. Finally, we in Europe and the International Maritime Organisation must encourage changes to the entire international maritime legislation, creating what I would call a ‘Galicia Protocol’, similar to the Kyoto Protocol, to resolve the problems of the sea, which is the reserve of humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Portugal is one of the countries most vulnerable to this type of incident. The <span class="italic">Prestige </span>spill almost reached our shores and, a few years ago, an incident with immense repercussions struck Porto Santo. Portuguese waters (by which I mean both the waters off the mainland and those around Madeira and the Azores) are subject to intense maritime traffic. That is why we always participate in these debates.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, just as I previously congratulated the Commissioner on her response to this incident and on the determination with which she produced the Erika I and Erika<span class="italic"> </span>II packages. I would say that if the Erika<span class="italic"> </span>I and Erika<span class="italic"> </span>II packages were fully implemented and all the measures this report proposes for the future applied over the next two years, we could rest secure in the knowledge that things had finally taken a turn for the better. We need to devote our political energies to this, however, because these words cannot sink beneath the waves as the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> did. They must remain on the political decision-making table.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains measures still aimed at dealing with the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. These measures must not be forgotten. I am referring to the explanation for the disaster, the social and economic consequences, and the ongoing environmental consequences, which must be avoided in future. The report also contains more general measures on which, of course, I would like to focus: specific shipping lanes, the question of safe havens, the question of adequate resources for providing assistance in this type of emergency and, above all, a more determined stance on the part of the European Union and all the Member States within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). It is time that all of us went to the IMO together and called for an end to this game of cat and mouse which international shipping seems to have become. Only if the Member States adopt a very determined political stance will we be able to make the seas around our countries – around the Community – safe from incidents of this kind, once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the crew, nor the coastal inhabitants in Spain and France, nor the Members of this Parliament can get this drama and its consequences out of their minds. For some, this report means the end of the Parliamentary debate on the matter of the ‘<span class="italic">Prestige</span>’. There is much that we do not yet know, however; there are many questions that remain unanswered, and that is disappointing. It has been suggested that the Spanish authorities could have limited the damage. That is why we support the request to carry out a more in-depth investigation into these facts in order to put paid to the gossip and smears once and for all. This investigation is also needed to help us take the best possible precautionary measures to prevent a disaster like this from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur deserves much praise for his report. It is extremely complete and contains a great deal of knowledge about the events. I particularly agree with the need for suitably equipped safe havens.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the requirement for oil tankers to be double-hulled and the requirement for an emergency action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, have considerable difficulty with the way in which the damage is recouped, partly because we are still unaware of the motivation of certain parties. We would have to mobilise all the Community resources to obtain compensation. These do, however, form an excellent enhancement of the initiatives of the various Member States. There are also international rules for this type of compensation. For the time being, I do not consider contributions from the Solidarity Fund to be appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Exchanges of information and ties of solidarity need to be properly developed by the parties concerned. That is why a Parliamentary temporary committee could be useful after the two-fold disaster of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> – my region was a victim of both – provided, of course, that we ensure that it does not become a forum for settling petty political scores, as could have been inferred from the circumstances in which certain Members proposed a committee of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a completely different operation. It would, of course, be inappropriate to set ourselves up as judges of a Member State government: what we need to do is record in a single list, compare and take stock of the different initiatives taken at all levels – at European level, by the Member States, the local authorities and the Commission – to address the consequences of these two terrible shipwrecks.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament would not be overstepping the mark if, with all due regard for subsidiarity, it were to endeavour, for the benefit of all, to identify the lessons to be learned from what went well and what went badly, to identify the limits of the Union’s sphere of activity, the shortcomings of international law, model initiatives to be promoted and joint measures to be developed and cofinanced by the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us this afternoon starts to venture along this tack, but, inevitably, only to a certain extent and proposing solutions which are, in some cases unrealistic and ineffective. I refer, in particular, to the idea of a federal European Coastguards Service or the proposals for making the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the Member States jointly responsible for emergency planning arrangements, which can only lead to a dangerous confusion of roles.</p>
<p class="contents">The major flaw in the current mechanism remains the question of liability and compensation. Although a welcome measure, Commissioner, increasing the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) ceiling is not enough, as we know. We cannot tolerate a system in which – as is currently the case – a large part of the compensation granted to victims is funded by the taxpayers of the countries or regions affected by the pollution. It must be possible to make all those responsible for the chain of events causing pollution criminally and financially liable. It is on this objective, Mr President, that the Member States should concentrate primarily, henceforth, in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament has clearly demonstrated that it is a match for the circumstances and I also would like to extend my thanks to the Commission, not only because it has spared no efforts in collaborating in Parliament’s work, putting forward an exhaustive report that formed the basis of the rapporteur’s report, nor for the courage the Commissioner has shown, initiating 10 infringement proceedings, but above all because it has proposed a whole catalogue of measures to the Member States, measures which, if they had been adopted, would have prevented all of the problems we are facing today.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Mr President, I would like to thank the Spanish authorities, who welcomed the members of the Commission and explained the scope of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> tragedy to them <span class="italic">in situ</span> as well as the measures designed to resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than dwelling on the grievances of the past, it would be interesting if we tried to mobilise all our efforts to overcome these situations and ensure that they are not repeated. It is important that we try to establish the necessary resources and mobilise them to ensure that this does not happen and try to avoid drawing political advantage from these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Mr President, I would like to mention the rapporteur’s Amendment No 11. He states that it is an amendment to set up a temporary committee but in reality, Mr President, as far as I am concerned it means, or implies, the constitution of a committee of inquiry. I believe that that would be a grave error for two reasons: firstly, because public opinion has already drawn its political conclusions and has expressed itself through its indisputable verdict at the ballot box, and secondly, Mr President, because a committee of inquiry is totally contrary to the substance and form of the Treaties and this House’s Rules of Procedure, which state that this is completely forbidden when a legal investigation is underway, because this is the appropriate means of determining who is actually responsible for this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">There is new, very interesting information as regards the seaworthiness of the vessel, the authorisation of the captain’s certificate, the statements made by the Brest maritime prefect at the hearing of the French National Assembly and the latest scientific simulation data, which was published yesterday and which states that in light of the adverse weather conditions it would have been almost impossible to provide shelter for the boat in a safe haven.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Sterckx, I would ask you to utilise your proven capacity for finding a consensus and to make every effort to find a solution to the problem of the committee, which cannot be a committee of inquiry – although you call it a temporary committee – not only because it would go against the Treaty, Mr President, but because it would cancel out your excellent work and that of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, robbing it of content and resulting in it not being worth the paper it is written on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Nunca Máis</span> was the cry we heard from November onwards in my region, Galicia – in other regions they were listening much further away – but also in other European regions that were affected by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, not the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. Unfortunately, it is not a new cry. As someone pointed out, it was a cry that was heard after the <span class="italic">Urquiola</span>, <span class="italic">Aegean Sea</span> and <span class="italic">Erika</span> disasters. The world moves quickly, consumer information, a product of our society, requires, like Saturn, new children to devour and new tragedies to hold the attention of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, after each tragedy the same thing has happened: some months after, the public’s attention moves on to other issues and the promised changes remain just that, mere promises.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are here now in this Parliament with the opportunity to ensure for once that that does not happen. We are here to ensure that for the first time a temporary committee is established – which my group has been calling for since the beginning of the tragedy – to analyse the causes and effects of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, to examine the Community and international regulations concerning maritime safety and to ensure the application of the petitions this Parliament will make tomorrow when approving the report we are debating today. I would like to thank Mr Sterckx and congratulate him on his report on my own behalf, on behalf of my group and on behalf of many Galicians who have a great deal of respect for your work, Mr Sterckx, thanks to your dedication, your political sensitivity and, above all, your impartiality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has made very clear its reasons for wanting the temporary committee. It has a vision of Europe that goes far beyond the sum of the 15 national realities. We believe that it is up to the institutions to promote certain policies, including maritime safety, and it is up to this House to ensure political control, which up to today – and even today – some people have tried to deny it. I am pleased that the rapporteur and the Liberal Group share this view and I call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House to unite with us rather than remaining alone on the sideline. Indeed, what was the problem in this tragedy? Was it the lack of places of refuge? No, of course not. The person or persons who decided to move the vessel further out to sea have never said that they moved the vessel because there was no place of refuge. On the contrary, what they say is that if the same thing happened again today, they would move it out to sea in the same way. What was the problem with this tragedy? Well, I believe it was the fact that it was played down. It has been said today that a temporary committee for the <span class="italic">Erika </span>would be accepted but not a temporary committee for the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. Mr Hatzidakis has said things that were much worse, for example that this was a Spanish problem. We will talk about that later. Thus, two Erika packages were drawn up and yet you do not want to admit that a Prestige package is required. The tourism minister in my region, Galicia, says that this is more of a media disaster than an ecological disaster, and he says this with 51 000 tonnes of waste collected from the sea, 79 000 tonnes of waste collected from the land and in France 31 000 tonnes collected from the land and 1 500 tonnes from the sea, solely along the French Atlantic coastline, and he said this 10 days ago, on the same day that the oil reached the Belgian coast. That is what the minister says.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a Prestige committee, we want a Prestige package and we want us to go on talking about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> for one simple reason: because the people who are unaware of its history, ladies and gentlemen, are destined to repeat it, and we do not want this tragedy ever to be repeated again, either in Galicia, in Greece, or anywhere else.</p>

As a Scandinavian, I usually only say thank you when there really is cause for doing so. As Dirk and the rest of you know, most of the cargo on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> came from Saint Petersburg through the Gulf of Finland, one of the seas that is extremely close to me and that is now already very polluted and vulnerable. What happened in Galicia could have happened in the Gulf of Finland. That is something we have said on numerous occasions. That is why we feel such solidarity with our friends in Galicia. We know that Russia’s oil exports, specifically through the Gulf of Finland, will be multiplied perhaps five- or six-fold in the course of the next few years. The same applies to the cargoes transported from Murmansk. It is not only the North Sea and the other areas mentioned that will be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask the Commission to devote special attention to Port State Control in the forthcoming progress report on the candidate countries. Obviously, there is still a great deal to be done in this area in order to ensure that the control is economically and legally independent. Unfortunately, we have heard of examples showing that this is not the case. Port State Control cannot operate unless it is independent and impartial. I therefore hope that the forthcoming progress report will support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I want to inform you all, together with the Commissioners, that the parliamentary assembly for the Baltic states, which met at the beginning of September in Uleåborg in Finland, was in favour of rapidly phasing out single-hull tankers and declaring the Baltic, or parts of it, to be a particularly sensitive sea area, or PSSA, a matter also addressed in paragraph 25 of the report. The important thing about this meeting was that members of the Russian state parliament and of Russian regional parliaments also supported this. In the continued debate, it is important for us to recognise that we shall get nowhere concerning many sea areas in Europe if the negotiations with third countries and with Russia do not produce results. The EU cannot attend to this alone. Instead, we need such support as we can get. That is why it is important that, in particular, the work concerning the Baltic take place in cooperation with colleagues. That is a road on which we can make further progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like preceding speakers, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, on the work he has accomplished in quite difficult conditions and on the close attention he has paid during the many debates that have taken place on the matter. I believe that this report will enable real progress to be made towards achieving greater maritime safety. I shall, therefore, confine myself to reiterating a few points on which I feel there is still room for improvement. The passing of time has revealed new aspects of the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and we now know, for example, about the astounding quantity of fuel leaking from the tanks which, we have been told, should have been emptied. I also believe that a temporary committee of inquiry is now more appropriate than ever. It is crucial for determining the causes and consequences of the sinking as objectively as possible, so that we can take the best decisions for the future. The European public would find it hard to understand why our Assembly is not proposing or accepting that just such a committee should be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: how can we fail to note that those responsible for these disasters are not the people who bear the heaviest financial, economic and social costs? The reign of irresponsibility and impunity must be brought to an end. It is a fact that most of these disasters do not have natural causes and are often the result of actions and management methods that are solely focused on the quest for profit, to the detriment of all other considerations. Consequently, money set aside for investment in the quality of vessels, in their upkeep and in the social conditions and training of seafarers is ceaselessly being whittled away. In this quest for profit, the honest people in the business – and there are a few of them – who do invest in safety are penalised. We must now, therefore, set up a system of compensation in which those who are responsible, the charterers, shipowners, owners and insurers pay for all the damage caused. The victims should be properly and fully compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Mr Sterckx’s report rightly raises the issue of flags of convenience and how to control them, I believe we should go further and ban vessels flying these flags in European waters, as Parliament called for in a previous resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will we be able to resolve maritime issues without the assistance of sailors, without their knowledge, their skills and their representatives. Any decision should be taken in a process of cooperation with those who earn their living at sea and who care about it. I believe that this does not currently happen as often as it should.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to draw attention to one further point. These debates on issues of maritime safety highlight the importance of actions that are public-spirited and socially responsible. Today, however, what is universally advocated is a policy of liberalisation. In the name of competition, there is a permanent quest to bring down costs. Are higher costs not precisely the price we must pay for improving safety? I believe that Europe must, on maritime issues as on others, take the standpoint of public responsibility, which states loudly and clearly that the main criterion is safety, the world we live in and the lives of those who inhabit it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dhaene (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I personally have been following this matter very closely from the start, as I, and many others like me, experienced this disaster as an attack on Europe. Ten months on, we are debating the resolution which is the result of the investigation carried out by our fellow Member Dirk Sterckx. It is a thorough investigation, as he even went to speak to the captain of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> who was not, let us remember, permitted to attend the hearing of the transport committee. I was on the fact finding mission to La Coruña and Brest. I would like to mention that there were very great differences in the openness shown by the various maritime authorities concerned. Openness is evidently still a difficult issue. The resolution provides a clear analysis of the facts that resulted in the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. It clearly sets out a number of actions which the European Union will have to undertake. It mentions the difficulties, such as port state control, and provides a good analysis of the necessary environmental measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done. I and my colleagues in our group are satisfied with the result. As the Council and the Commission are dealing with what is written here meticulously, the call ‘<span class="italic">nunca mais’</span> (never again) will be heeded. The work of the Commission shows that the message has been received. The European Agency for Maritime Safety is being given the mandate and the resources to act. The resolution also indicates the limits of the procedure to be followed, however.</p>
<p class="contents">My group was initially unhappy with the procedure that has been followed in this matter. From the start we have argued for a parliamentary investigation committee or a temporary committee which will ‘get to the bottom of the matter’. How unfortunate that expression sounds in this context! The facts that have come to light over the past few months are confirmation for us that we were on the home stretch. Now we have new arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is still a lack of clarity regarding who was responsible for the decision to tow the ship further out to sea and for the inadequate dispatch of emergency assistance. Statements from the French parliament reveal that France was also involved in sending the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> into Portuguese waters. These facts reopen the whole discussion. The debate on the way in which we in the European Union make arrangements and take decisions about cross-border emergency situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can only now begin to assess and calculate the overall extent of the economic and ecological damage. Only now, after the summer, can estimates be made of the damage to the tourism sector. I was in Galicia this summer and I saw that there were fewer foreign tourists on the coast, that blobs of oil were being washed up on to the beach every day and that there were still rocks hidden underneath the oil and there were still no warnings about pollution from the ever-present people from the Environment Ministry.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the establishment of a Temporary Committee on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is a matter that also affects the credibility of our institution. I personally find it extremely inappropriate that some representatives of the Spanish Government appeared as witnesses in the French parliament, but are not attending the hearings in this Parliament. The International Maritime Organisation did not feel obliged to appear before the European Parliament either. They evidently think that that is beneath them! This cannot be permitted, something must be done about this!</p>
<p class="contents">The quickest route to further investigation is the compromise amendment that Mr Sterckx himself submitted in this regard. Our group will support this. In doing so we are sending a signal to the Commission and the Council that we are closely monitoring what they are doing, and that this Parliament is itself playing an active role in maritime safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot forbear to emphasise that, in Denmark and especially in areas near the coast, including the small islands, there prevails a good deal of frustration at the fact that an increasing number of single-hulled tankers with both light and heavy fuel oils pass through our waters. It is grotesque that the EU should invest billions in obtaining a cleaner Baltic Sea, at the same time as there is an increasing amount of oil being transported in ways that constitute a danger. The aid to the countries in the area of the Baltic Sea should be linked closely to a rapid halt to voyages undertaken by single-hulled vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish islands and the area around the Baltic Sea are especially vulnerable to the pollution that can be caused by just one shipwreck. Russia’s development of its oil terminals, resulting in many instances of oil being transported through the area of the Baltic Sea, is therefore extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">In very practical terms, the EU can do three things.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it can campaign for the Baltic Sea to be classified as a particularly sensitive area. Partly because of the limited quantity of water flowing through it, the Baltic Sea is just such an area. By classifying it in this way, it would be possible to take the necessary preventive measures to protect the area against dangerous transports of oil through its waters. Finally, the EU can also lobby within the IMO for the phasing-out of single-hulled tankers globally. Last but not least, it can allow the phasing-out of the single-hulled tankers to be part of the deliberations concerning the allocation of aid to environmental development so that maximum pressure is exerted upon Russia to persuade it to introduce bans on single-hulled tankers putting in at the country’s ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner if contact has been made with the Russian authorities and if there is any news – ideally good news – from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

[Never again!] This is the relevant phrase and the proper aim for maritime disasters, which have serious ecological, economic and human costs, such as oil slicks, for example. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go to improve maritime safety. At European level and following the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, the Commission proposed an entire set of measures that are appropriate and bold – the Erika I and Erika II packages – in order to prevent similar disasters. These measures would clearly have enabled us to prevent to another oil slick from occurring.</p>
<p class="contents">You have been extremely bold, Commissioner, and entirely right. Unfortunately, due to the reprehensible shilly-shallying of some Member States, these Erika I and Erika II packages only entered into force this year and only on 23 July at that. The Commission has opened legal proceedings against ten Member States that have failed to meet their obligations to notify. In any event, these measures entered into force far too late to prevent the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and the heavy fuel that it was transporting is still polluting coasts from Galicia to Brittany, including my own region, Aquitaine, with the extremely serious consequences of which we are all aware.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know that the proposed compensation will cover only a tiny part of the damage that has been caused. There have been so many human tragedies and so many barely healed wounds, and this is why it is crucial to find out what decision has been taken to recover the thousands of tonnes of fuel that remain in the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. There is an urgent obligation to clarify this matter. Furthermore, we know that the compensation proposed by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (FIPOL) will only cover a tiny part of the damage that has been caused. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to do everything within their power to ensure that the European Supplementary Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, the COPE Fund proposed by the Erika II package is implemented in order to provide additional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Many documents have been published on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and, for this reason, I wish to quote from the remarkable report drawn up by the French National Assembly. The European Parliament, for its part, has held two hearings with the European Commission and enquiries are still ongoing. Legal proceedings have been opened in both France and Spain, and elsewhere, to establish the true circumstances of the shipwreck and the responsibilities of the various actors involved in this tragedy. In my view, those who are recommending a committee of inquiry into the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> are doing so for political reasons. We must look to the future; to prevention, and not make political capital out of this tragic affair. This is why, as a Member of the European Parliament, my thoughts are primarily with the victims and therefore to prevent, first and foremost, further disasters from occurring. I hope to forge ahead on this matter and this is why I tabled an amendment, accepted by my group, calling for a temporary committee to be set up, with the task of assessing the effectiveness of the Erika I and II packages, in order to prevent any further disasters and, if necessary, to propose strengthening them. There are many questions to which we and the general public wish to have answers and it is time that answers were provided. What is position of the Member States’? How reliable are double-hulled ships? What progress has been made on the concept of safe havens, to which Mr Sterckx referred earlier? The temporary committee will be able to answer this question and others and to provide reassurance; that is its sole purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you will be able to look beyond the political differences and agree, on this extremely important subject, to support this forward-looking initiative. This is still the best way of proclaiming <span class="italic">Nunca máis</span>! [Never again!] </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We were told, let me remind you, that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> had set off from the Baltic, and that – leaving Austria and Luxembourg out – it had, at least in theory passed by every one of the Member States, so that what happened could have happened anywhere. This means that we need not just technical improvements but also safer shipping lanes. We have been told more than once about the blackspots in the Baltic, such as, for example, the ‘Kadetrinne’, where what basically happens is that ships end up travelling in the wrong direction, so that near-accidents are an almost daily occurrence. That is why there is an urgent need for mandatory pilotage there, and that is something we want to bring up in this House. It is the Russians who are refusing to accept this, so I would like to see us in this House make explicit reference to it when we vote, and put more pressure on Russia in this matter, as mandatory pilotage is inordinately important.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that there of course have to be emergency measures, with clear responsibilities and adequate provision of tugboats. Perhaps Commissioner De Palacio will again give some thought to what was said at the first meeting about the issue of linking this with compensation, as this may simplify the practical side of any emergency measures. Quite apart from the disasters, we must not forget the mess that is made in European coastal waters on a daily basis. In 2001, 390 oil slicks were illegally deposited in the Baltic, with another 596 in the North Sea. Commissioner, I think it right and proper that you have put something forward about once and for all categorising this as criminal wrongdoing and dealing with it by means of criminal law. Fines are not enough to deal with this; no longer must it be possible to pay them out of the petty cash. Such pollution of the sea is a crime, and must be punished accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Technology, though, is not the decisive factor. I very much welcomed your commencement, in July, of proceedings in respect of infringements of the Treaties against ten Member States that have not yet transposed even the measures decided on after <span class="italic">Erika</span>. It is, basically, sad that this should be so. Those ten Member States should be ashamed of themselves, and the country holding the presidency being one of them is a bitter pill to swallow. We need port State control and classification societies. The Member States did not need the accident that befell the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> to make that clear to them. That was what we decided post-<span class="italic">Erika</span>, and you yourselves all signed up to it. I think, Commissioner, that you will have every support from Parliament in these matters – on which both Parliament and the Council have come to decisions – in pressing for this to be transposed into national law, failing which this whole Council will remain a bunch of hypocrites, and we will be unable to make any promises to the public about safety.</p>

It focuses attention on absolutely essential matters regarding safety at sea. Mr Sterckx has worked hard in drafting this report and, moreover, he, together with Mr Vermeer, has proposed many well justified amendments, which I hope the whole of Parliament will support.</p>
<p class="contents">When improving safety at sea it is essential that the existing international rules are complied with. Countries must have clear contingency plans. There has to be adequate salvage and oil-slick control equipment to ensure that, when necessary, it can be at the scene of an accident quickly and that a catastrophe such as this never happens again.</p>
<p class="contents">I also would like to stress that the decisions taken within the Union alone are not enough to increase safety at sea. Questions of responsibility must be dealt with on a global basis. In order to improve safety at sea we need global agreements concluded within the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also would like to mention an example. The number of consignments of oil passing through the Gulf of Finland from Russia has been increasing very fast. At the same time, the risk of an accident involving petroleum products in the environmentally highly sensitive area of the Baltic Sea has grown quickly. It is essential for Baltic traffic that Russia is included in all these agreements on safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk is further increased in the wintertime by the serious problems of ice in northern sea areas. I would like to use this opportunity to ask the Commissioner when the Commission intends to issue an ice classification directive applicable to the Union. I furthermore propose that the Commission should draft a communication on the development of traffic networks in the Union’s northern area which would also give pride of place to matters of safety at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, although the intentions stated in this report are good, one would be entitled to wonder who will enforce the resolutions that have been adopted. Will the European institutions dare to challenge the huge oil companies by imposing the ‘polluter pays’ principle? Most of all, will they dare to prevent these companies from causing damage by forcing them to adopt precautionary measures, even if these eat into their profits? We all know the answer to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, the Total oil corporation has only partially compensated the victims of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, leaving the State, in other words the taxpayers – to cover the remainder. Two years after the accident, Total has also failed to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse. These huge corporations can pollute, ruin the livelihoods of thousands of people who earn a living from the sea or, like AZF, be responsible for manslaughter through negligence without even being called to account. They hide behind national or European law because they know that the States, which show no mercy towards small offenders, do not bother the large corporations responsible for causing damage on a completely different scale. Penalties imposed on underlings such as the captain of the ship that causes the pollution are iniquitous, because those who are really responsible– in other words the real beneficiaries of the quest for profit – the owners and the major shareholders of the petrol or chemical corporations, are left untroubled. As I am sure you have understood, we are highlighting the good intentions that have been declared in this report, but we harbour no illusions about its implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been a witness to the dedication, thoroughness and desire to gather all the information, seek solutions for the future and find consensus in the debate within Spain on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. However, allow me to make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made here to the creation of a temporary committee to examine in detail the causes and consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, dealing with the future and with maritime safety. Reference has been made to the inadmissibility at the present time of investigating this issue and examining it in detail as it violates the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure, even if it is done under the auspices of a temporary committee, when there are legal proceedings underway. We have heard that proceedings are underway in France and Spain, and we know that they are underway in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware of the will involved, which differs according to the intentions of each person in these types of committees. Here there are Members and political groups whose intentions will come to an end in March 2004, with the results of the general elections in Spain. There are some people for whom the results would end if, were the Spanish authorities to be deemed responsible, they were to obtain compensation as a guarantee, as may happen if it is the Kingdom of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">That was not what we were trying to do in this House, however. What we were trying to do was to analyse what happened with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and determine the consequences so as to enable us to put forward maritime safety measures for the future. That was the context of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall here the rapporteur’s words during the last debate in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, where he said that he could not see how there could be a committee of inquiry, that after everything he had studied in drawing up his report and the contributions in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, it would be difficult to push forward the idea of a committee of inquiry. It is important to recall here the trips, the presentations, the hearings, the documents, etc. We know that in Denmark a pilot detected that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> was not seaworthy and yet allowed it to continue sailing; we know that the classification society had clearly not complied with its duties to inspect the repairs; we know that the vessel had carried out a series of bunkering operations, 174 times, and that it cracked in those same places where it had been repaired.</p>
<p class="contents">That is of no concern, however. What is of concern is who took the decision and why. Ladies and gentlemen, read the documents. In the report by the Spanish Government, in the hearing attended by the Spanish authorities, in Galicia, etc., only one person is responsible: the Director General of the Merchant Navy, the highest political, professional and technical authority in Spain, and this has been recognised. Moreover, we have the statements from the Brest maritime prefect, where he states that he advised a change of course and that it was impossible for this vessel to enter a place of refuge as it was going to break up. However, ladies and gentlemen, none of this is of any interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, we are faced with a political debate that is not searching to clarify the truth. In this case, I am calling for the search for a future, the search for maritime safety measures and not merely an internal debate which, I will say it again, for many will end in March 2004 with the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to Mr Sterckx to seek a formula for consensus where we concentrate genuinely on maritime safety in Europe rather than an internal debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important.</p>
<p class="contents">From next year the Baltic Sea will in practice be an internal sea of the Union, a sea whose waters are completely replaced only once in a quarter of a century. It is unusually susceptible to the damaging effects of petroleum products. At the upper end of the Gulf of Finland another oil harbour is already being built which constitutes a threat to the safety of the entire sea. Remember that, when sailing there, there can be pack ice 20 metres high! At the same time ferry traffic between Helsinki and Tallinn is on the increase, so now we urgently need the proposal promised by the Commissioner for traffic arrangements in this sea. Soon a hundred million tonnes of oil will be transported across the Baltic Sea every year, but all countries together have the resources to clean up just 10 000 tonnes, or one tank on one ship, which corresponds to 0.01% of the total. Consequently, there is a real danger that disasters will occur. There were collisions just last winter: ships crashed into one another.</p>
<p class="contents">The decommissioning of single-hull vessels must not be delayed to the extent it appears to be. From our point of view, the situation is such that this should be done right away, and not in several years’ time. The Baltic Sea should also have special zones which these ships could traverse only with the protection of an escort, for example a pilot ship, with oil slick control facilities. There should also be help from breakers, which many vessels on their way to Russian ports never had at all, not to speak of merchant ships, which sailed there amid the ice for weeks without this help.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more support and action from the Commission. I support the establishment of a temporary committee of inquiry to deal with this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is a balanced assessment of the events surrounding the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and contains sound recommendations, whether on the prevention of such problems in the future or on ways of managing them more effectively. The rapporteur is right in stating in today's debate that his report deals with safety at sea, now and in future. I always see it as a problem when we discuss an investigative report that it appears, and becomes, a discussion after the event about something that should have been prevented. It is a logical step to call for new rules and measures. As always where the topic of safety at sea is concerned, there is a considerable risk that nothing else will get done. I shall return to this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">A major problem in the area of maritime safety is not so much the lack of an international legal framework, but rather the enforcement of the rules and the tracking down of infringements. The rapporteur is right in noting that <span class="italic">Erika</span> legislation has not been able to prevent the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, which is painfully similar to that involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. Prevention is paramount. It is inevitable that the rules will be tightened, although in my view, we should, above all, make a critical assessment of the implementation of existing legislation. Our first priority should therefore be a swift and complete introduction and, most of all, a strict enforcement of this legislation by the Member States. I therefore believe that it is the role of Parliament to bring this issue to the Council’s attention, and I naturally rely on the Commission's support, but I fear that legal procedures in this matter are not all that effective because they take such a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Of great importance is the designation of safe havens, as well as the use of reception installations for excess oil in ports, which presuppose adequate payment schemes that are uniform throughout the European Union for effective use. Major problems result from this latter not being done, and from these installations being used infrequently.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I also have in mind a prevention measure such as the monitoring of dangerous situations and infringements by means of a more extensive application of voice-data recording<span class="italic"> </span>systems. These offer scope for prevention, monitoring and assessment of the situation after the event. And last but not least, criminal sanctions with a deterrent effect. The Commission proposal on criminal sanctions for environmental offences, on which I am rapporteur, is very much in keeping with the Sterckx report. Even though my report focuses on illegal dumping, the implications are sadly the same.</p>
<p class="contents"> My fear, expressed earlier, that we will not move beyond the talking stage is, unfortunately, well-founded. In the immediate aftermath of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, the government leaders called for measures and sanctions. What has become of this willingness to take action? Now that the proposals have been tabled, we see a very inadequate implementation of the measures in the Member States, and I find out that the Council of Ministers has unanimously rejected the introduction of criminal sanctions. My work on a report will therefore be in vain. The question that will dominate the next couple of weeks is, how the Commission, Parliament and the Council can be persuaded to adopt a consistent policy. An open debate with the Council would be a good start. Fortunately, the Commissioner has said that she did not want to be on the sidelines. Commissioner, we are watching a game where the players seem to be standing still. The above demonstrates that I am in favour of action, and this is why I do not identify all that well with the amendments that have been tabled in favour of setting up a committee of inquiry about the past. As I have already stated, we have inquired long enough, we must now implement the measures we have been talking about. What we need is a task force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want you to take into account the sincere congratulations of our group and I would also like to join in the congratulations for our Commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, for the rigour, efficiency and seriousness she has demonstrated in her work on maritime safety since taking up her position.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are significant differences between the outlook that existed previously and the outlook today. There have been very significant proposals and changes and in your report, as has been mentioned here, you put forward 112 issues that are of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to highlight a major change that has taken place in the IMO, which up to now was practically immovable. Corridors have been created as have particularly sensitive sea areas from Scotland to the Algarve, where vessels carrying dangerous cargo must report their arrival 48 hours in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the right path, but we must ask ourselves if this is enough. I would like to join the Commissioner in reminding you, as she has always done here, that if the Erika packages that she proposed to us had been approved, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident would not have happened. I think that that is very important and we must not forget it because the key lies precisely in regulations and compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Parliament is still responsible for monitoring compliance in each of the Member States. Monitoring and adapting these proposals is our duty. Therefore, we must not lower our guard and we must continue to be constantly vigilant as well as being constant allies of the Commission. Ladies and gentlemen, as far as I am concerned, that is what the citizens are asking of those of us who represent them here and, first and foremost, Galicians, since they have suffered these consequences at their core to a greater extent than anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus proposed the creation of a specific committee, with a clear and positive mandate, which is to monitor this legislation and demonstrably increase maritime safety, ensuring compliance. I believe that this is a key issue that I want to pass on to Mr Sterckx, who will no doubt be aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said here, and I am not going to repeat it, that others seek to drag out these processes, perhaps by obstructing the actions we are proposing and prolonging the granting of compensation. A debate of a different type could also promote or encourage with these committees of inquiry interests that have been called mafias here; I would say the oil companies. If we sow seeds of doubt as to the responsibilities, we will benefit other parties who are also responsible for what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we cannot with our actions take it upon ourselves to act as judges and hand down guilty sentences to anyone. That is not our role and indeed we are forbidden from doing so by Article 193 of the Treaty and our Rules of Procedure, as this case is already being examined before the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our role to stamp out easy money and businesses without scruples in maritime transport that damage the marine environment and its resources. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are going to be active in defending those interests and in eradicating ‘rubbish boats’.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I want to emphasise that the Galicians are not abandoned, they have never been abandoned, either by the Galician Government, by the Spanish Government or by the European Commission. I also want to point out that, as you know, Mr Sterckx, in the electoral process that took place in the so-called ground zero, in Muxía, the majority supported the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which was governing and which continues to govern, and the citizens are very knowledgeable in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, at present all of the fishing grounds in Galicia are open, the entire coast is open for fishing and the necessary resources to resolve all of these problems are being provided through the generosity of the Spanish Government and the Galician Government via the so-called ‘Galicia Plan’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It makes sense, almost a year after the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>incident, to assess the situation and see what lessons can be learnt. First of all, with respect to the environment, credit is due to the efforts made by the Spanish authorities, with the invaluable help of fishermen and thousands of volunteers, to extract the remaining fuel oil, minimise the risks, clean up the coastline and repair ecosystems, though it is regrettable that pollutants are still leaking from the wreck every day.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with respect to assigning liability, it is deplorable that, a year on, investigations should be so faint-hearted. This is a matter not simply of investigating, trying and punishing the polluter, but also of assigning liability at other levels: firstly, at the level of those who should have inspected the ship and failed to do so and, secondly, at the level of those who conducted inspections and then failed to act on them. Lastly, it should be determined to what extent those who managed the crisis are liable. Assigning liability may be an uncomfortable process, but it is an essential one. Rather than set up a belated temporary Parliamentary committee on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, however, our responsibility is to implement, on a daily basis, all the democratic controls falling within our competence, as, indeed, we have today.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with respect to legislation, I welcome the Commission proposals to shorten the implementation deadlines for the Erika I and Erika II packages. The Member States are now responsible for ensuring full and speedy compliance with the regulations enshrining the ban on single hull vessels, more thorough inspections of vessels in our ports, monitoring systems, the list of safe havens and contingency plans in case of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond these initiatives, however, it is vital to go further and implement new rules, such as establishing shipping lanes further away from the coasts, inspecting ships carrying dangerous substances within the 200-mile zone, drawing up a code of conduct for manufacturers and freight companies, establishing a European fleet of pollution-fighting ships, laying down minimum requirements for resources and equipment for providing assistance, rescue and preventive measures. Finally, a clear timetable for introducing changes to international maritime law must be established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The one hundred and twelve measures proposed guarantee that things will be brought up to date, and provide for the actions necessary for us to free ourselves from the fear of serious and avoidable dangers such as the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>accident<span class="italic"> </span>– and other previous ones – resulting from transporting dangerous cargoes under maritime safety conditions as precarious and shameful as those which led to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and other previous accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need international and national measures, but above all we need the laws to be enforced and respected scrupulously from the outset. To this end, controls must be strict and sanctions vigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that Amendment No 12, presented by several Members on behalf of the PPE, calling for an examination of the application of the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages is timely and complements the measures proposed in the Sterckx report, and furthermore to a certain extent is going to highlight the enormous support that the Commission, and in particular the Commissioner herself, has given to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that Amendment No 11 from Mr Sterckx improves his report. What it does is to get into a game which, as Mr Ripoll has just quite rightly pointed out, will come to an end the day the elections take place in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to see any more accidents like this one. We want the environment to be respected and protected, since in many cases it provides the main source of economic and social stability for its people. We do not want to undermine the European Parliament’s right and duty of political control. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident was huge and tragic and must not happen again. But neither should other practices which day by day, drop by drop, pollute our seas, often in the face of inaction on the part of people who today are screaming blue murder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Commission's original <span class="italic">Erika</span> package had been implemented, single-hulled tankers like the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> would have been replaced by 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster highlighted the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation and the lack of a sufficient EU response mechanism, which aggravated the environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time the Spanish Government was criticised for towing the stricken vessel out to sea, ignoring the advice of experts who argued that it should be taken to a sheltered bay or port where the oil could be contained. Ironically, Mr Sterckx's report points out that six months later, neither France nor Spain had designated safe havens and contingency plans to the Commission, as required by EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> incident should have been viewed as occurring in EU waters, with potentially devastating consequences for the shared environment and European fishing industries. Environmental disasters of this magnitude underline the need for an EU coastguard. It cannot simply be left to individual Member States to act alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been campaigning for the establishment of an EU Coastguard for a number of years. As well as the problems of marine pollution, European citizens are also alarmed that our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs, cigarettes and human beings. Furthermore, given the present geo-political climate, with the increased possible threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe, we should consider how best to prevent such an attack occurring. Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant to the daily lives of their citizens. Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it addresses the real concerns of those they and we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome the rapporteur's proposal for the establishment of an EU coastguard and also the similar call made recently by the current President-in-Office of the Council, Silvio Berlusconi. This is an idea whose time has come and action should be taken upon it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">Prestige </span>accident that happened 10 months ago brought about an ecological and economic disaster of exceptional proportions. This is just the sort of approach we need to ensure that something like this never happens again. It is vitally important to analyse the causes of the accident and draw the relevant political conclusions. It has to be said, actually, that most of the necessary legislation to promote safety at sea already exists. The measures laid down in the two Erika packages could have prevented the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety at sea can be improved if existing international rules are complied with. The first requirement is for Member States to make the Erika legislation that has been adopted part of national law as quickly as possible and monitor its application strictly. Monitoring for compliance with international legislation will also be of primary importance. The Commission should propose an amendment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, for which Parliament would have much to propose.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a coastal state has no authority over vessels transiting along its coastline flying the flag of another state and outside its territorial waters. The Convention does not reflect present maritime reality. The Commission must, as a matter of urgency, obtain a negotiating mandate from the Council. A coastal state is in the best position to monitor ships off its coast and should be given certain powers to take action in exceptional cases. Only in that way can we include third countries and ships not registered in any country in the same objective. We likewise have to develop our assessment of cross-border environmental impact. That will be an important tool, particularly in the protection of the seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Every accident involving petroleum products is a catastrophe we cannot afford. It also has to be said that the European Union has certain particularly vulnerable sea areas, such as the Baltic, where, if an accident were to occur, it would be an utter calamity. I myself have proposed that the EU should join the Arctic Council. EU membership of the Arctic Council would strengthen Euro-Atlantic understanding in the area of the environment and the EU would have an important forum in which to address issues such as the protection of sea wildlife in the north. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I know, the <span class="italic">Viking</span> was not denied access to a port of refuge. The ship sailed to Rotterdam because it is a double-hulled ship that had sunk deeper because the double hull had flooded. The ship then sailed under its own steam to Belgian waters, which, strictly speaking, is already against the rules, and was denied access to Zeebrugge and Ostend. The owner refused to conclude a contract with the salvager. So there was a problem. This is the information I have. It would perhaps be useful if a temporary committee were to institute inquiries into incidents that have not resulted in disasters. After all, we could learn a great deal from them about how we should organise things more effectively. However, I think that the Belgian authorities, in the case involving the <span class="italic">Viking</span>, did not make the kind of errors that we can observe in the present case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us be frank. For a long time, the European Union’s best maritime safety policy was not to have one at all. I am going to refer solely to the last fifteen years, because it is since then that we have had the Single Act <span class="bold"></span> and therefore majority voting – in the field of transport. And I am only going to refer to the most spectacular cases. 1987: <span class="italic">Casón</span>, Europe, chemical products, 23 dead; 1989: <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span>, in the United States, 40 000 tonnes of spillage; 1991: <span class="italic">Haven</span>, in Europe, 144 000 tonnes of oil; 1992: the <span class="italic">Mar Egeo</span>, Europe, 74 000 tonnes of crude oil; 1993: <span class="italic">Braer</span>, also in Europe, 85 000 tonnes of spillage; 1996: <span class="italic">Sea Empress</span>, 70 000 tonnes of spillage, also in Europe; 1997: in Japan there has been the spillage from the <span class="italic">Nakhodka</span>, with 19 000 tonnes of crude oil; in 1999, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> spilled 20 000 tonnes of heavy oil in Europe and in 2002, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, also in Europe, 63 000 tonnes of heavy oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must bear very much in mind that in 1987 (<span class="italic">Casón</span>), in 1991 (<span class="italic">Haven</span>), in 1992 (<span class="italic">Mar Egeo</span>), in 1993 (<span class="italic">Braer</span>) and in 1996 (<span class="italic">Sea Empress</span>), there were national, regional and European governments. There was a Commission, a Parliament and a Council of Ministers and nothing was done. That was the situation, ladies and gentlemen. We had to wait until 1999, with this Commission and this Parliament, for measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1981, immediately after the sinking of the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span>, the United States implemented the OPA (Oil Pollution Act); if we in Europe, in 1987, 1991 or 1992, had done the same, we would surely have prevented the <span class="italic">Braer</span>, the <span class="italic">Sea Empress</span>, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accidents, just to mention the most serious cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prevent this from happening again, ladies and gentlemen. There are two aspects: prevention, and dealing with disasters if they happen. The report by Mr Sterckx is very complete and I have congratulated him on it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of seeing whether the cases we are now working on (the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>) allow us to prevent future accidents and, furthermore, present to the International Maritime Organisation certain ground rules which prevent this from happening in any part of the world. I am not at all happy with the idea of polluting the other seas of the world and therefore we must work to see how we can prevent that from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond very briefly to certain questions. Double hulls, as the report by Mr Sterckx points out quite correctly, help and improve, but they are not the solution. We must seek a series of measures to increase safety. Furthermore, we are monitoring and analysing the ageing of these oil tankers, which have other problems which must be closely monitored, and we must also establish a maximum age and a form of monitoring and inspection from a certain age.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the European coastguards, I fully agree with the European Parliament’s position, but also have to know where we are. We are taking the first steps, by means of the Agency, in order to better coordinate the actions and control and rescue capacities of the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is recovering oil. The Commission is determined to deal with this issue and I must say that the government in question, the Spanish Government, has also stressed and reiterated its determination to carry out this recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, cleaning ships. One of your speeches referred to ‘pump ships’. That is what we are proposing, and we would ask for your support with regard to the modification of the Agency’s capacities and the budgets for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I referred myself to the social aspect and to the issue of a language for communication on each ship and, of course, the capacity for communication with external control systems. We have talked about this and we are working on it with a view to making a clear proposal in this regard in the future <span class="italic">Prestige II</span> or <span class="italic">Erika IV</span> package.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we cannot say that today the same could happen as happened three or four years ago, with the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, nor even one year ago, with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, because we have adopted extremely urgent measures which are already being applied in advance, and secondly, because part of the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages are already in force and are obliging, for example, countries which have not been carrying out port controls, to do so. In fact, we are demanding compliance with the obligations before the Luxembourg Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic. Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard several speeches on this subject and I understand your concern. I am concerned about the Baltic and also about other closed seas, such as the Black Sea, which is already a European coast and which will be a European Union sea, and the Mediterranean, which already is one. They are also closed seas where there is significant oil tanker traffic and where any disaster involving pollution would have far more negative consequences than they would in the Baltic, as a result of the problem of regeneration, cleaning and renewal of their waters. In this regard, we are working with our Russian neighbours, because they are fundamental in the Baltic and also because they are great exporters of oil, in order to improve safety and guarantees and in order to improve and implement a system of sea traffic control, which is absolutely essential, at least for ships carrying potentially dangerous goods. Not only for them, I believe, but at least, as a first step, for ships with potentially dangerous goods and for ferries, which transport people, and which also have problems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the captain, there is one issue: judicial decisions, in the country I know best, are taken by judges and are independent. Neither the Spanish authorities nor the European authorities nor the regional authorities have much say in the matter. This is decided by the judge on duty, and I can assure you that they are enormously protective of their independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost a year ago we saw almost epic images of the seamen of the Galician <span class="italic">rias</span> facing what appeared to be an inevitable disaster and fighting with all the means available to them, including their good luck, to halt an oil slick which appeared to be about to enter finally the very rich Galician <span class="italic">rias</span>, the <span class="italic">Rías Bajas</span>, which are a source and breeding ground for European biodiversity and life. And they won the battle, through spectacular efforts. They worked day and night. All that mattered to those people was to win the battle against the sea. I know this because I spoke to several of them, and I know that many people here also did so.</p>
<p class="contents">As a tribute to those people who demonstrated the courage of sea-going people, and as a tribute to the thousands and thousands of volunteers who have worked there throughout all this time, and to the concern and solidarity shown throughout Europe in the face of the nature of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>tragedy, I would like to say that we must ensure that it can never happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to accept that this is what we must talk about with a view to the future. For a long time things have been left, for a long time things have not been done and now it is we who are doing things. This Parliament, in accordance with your responsibilities; this Commission, in accordance with its responsibilities, and also the Council. And we must ensure success, and you still have a few months ahead of you.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming months we can speed up the issue of criminal responsibility for example, which I am still hoping we can bring forward; we can, for example, convince the Council not to demand unanimity when it comes to legally defining sea pollution, as we in the Commission have called for, and I hope the honourable Members will support us in this. There are a series of positive issues on which we can and must work.</p>
<p class="contents">You can always count on me with regard to the prevention of disasters such as those we have experienced, and I hope I will be able to continue to count on all of you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
