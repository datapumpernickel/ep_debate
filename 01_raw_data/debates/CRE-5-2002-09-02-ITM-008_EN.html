<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, the fact that Parliament views this report with great seriousness can be gauged from the two major hearings which have been held during the past year: one by ECOSOC and one by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable why Members are concerned. In the EU at the present time we have a 35 million tonne annual shortfall in plant proteins. This situation has been exacerbated by the continuing MBM (meat and bone meal) ban which has created a further 2 million tonne hole in our protein supply. EU self-sufficiency in plant proteins has fallen to 23%, placing the Community in a position of great vulnerability. We now have an enormous reliance on imported proteins from outside the EU. Most of it comes from America, Argentina and Brazil in the form of soya cake. Much of it is genetically modified. Clearly such heavy reliance on sources outside our control makes the EU vulnerable to sudden price rises, climate change or harvest failures in these countries, almost placing our livestock sector in the same position as our heavy industry once was at the time of the oil crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further alarming factor which will inevitably add to our problems. Currently the accession states are more than 80% self-sufficient in plant proteins. While this is a considerable improvement on the situation in the 15 Member States, it remains the case that the accession states, for the most part, export their oil seed because their crushing mills are obsolete, meaning that they still have to import soya cake in large quantities for their livestock sector. However, the Commission is forecasting a fall in plant protein production in these countries once they become full Members of the EU and a switch to cereals. This would be disastrous. We have a ready-made market for oil seeds and protein crops from which the accession states could benefit greatly. On the other hand, an increase in cereal production would simply add to the overall surplus and lead to the introduction of higher set-aside rates. We must implement a plan which would encourage the production of rape seed, pulses, sunflower and soya and provide major economic benefits, not only to the accession states, but to ourselves, through greater self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the existing Member States and the accession states, we also anticipate a continuing rise in meat consumption which will in turn lead to a demand from livestock producers for ever greater quantities of protein feed.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is against this background that I have set out in my report to look for ways of encouraging more self-reliance within the EU. Amongst many recommendations, I have suggested various ways of encouraging an increase in plant protein production by investing more in research into and development of new and improved plant varieties. I have also called for rotational aid payments to farmers to encourage the production of plant proteins in the cereal crop cycle and for the growing of protein crops, grain legumes and oil seeds on set-aside land. I have called for a safety net or income insurance scheme for producers of oil seed and protein crops.</p>
<p class="contents">I am alarmed at the continuing ban on fish meal in ruminant feeds by the Commission. I see this as quite unjustified by science and simply adding to our overall protein shortfall. I urge Commissioner Byrne to think again on this issue and to lift the ban, which is affecting a significant number of jobs in the fish processing and livestock feed sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is great potential in developing the non-food sector. The production of oil-bearing plants for biofuels such as methylester and for biolubricants and biodegradable solvents is important in the concept of this debate because oil cake is produced as a valuable by-product. The Commission has shown a great deal of interest in this sector. It merits closer examination. However, developments in this area are mainly determined by the tax situation for biofuels. We have a long way to go before we can expect agreement on an EU-wide harmonised system of taxation which would encourage greater biofuel production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I fear that the mid-term review of the CAP since the Agriculture Committee dealt with my report may have significantly altered the thrust of some of these recommendations. I would be interested in hearing how Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Fischler think the mid-term review will affect this position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, and also the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their constructive attitude to this communication. At the outset, we would do well to recall the context in which the present discussions about protein crops arose. Since the Council Decision of 4 December 2000, the use of processed animal protein has been banned in feed for all animals. Because the use of animal meal for ruminants had already been forbidden for a number of years, the ban mainly concerned the pig and poultry sectors. Shortly afterwards, the European Council in Nice took note of the Commission's intention to analyse the supply of and demand for oilseed and protein-bearing crops in strict compliance with the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">This analysis resulted in the Commission papers presented in March 2001. Let me summarise the conclusions which we drew from our analysis of the situation and of possible policy options. Firstly, the ban on meat and bonemeal for non-ruminants would create a deficit of 1.5 million tonnes of soyameal equivalent. Secondly, increased aid for EU domestic production would produce disappointing results: little extra output at a high cost. Furthermore, our degree of self-sufficiency would scarcely change. Thirdly, increased aid for oilseeds would bring us back into the Blair House Agreement's restrictions on areas cultivated with crop-specific aids.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the presentation of our report, we have continued our reflections not only on plant proteins but indeed across the board. This culminated in the mid-term review of the EU's common agricultural policy presented by the Commission on 10 July 2002. The Commission is of the opinion that public expenditure in the farm sector must be better justified. Besides supporting farming incomes, it must yield more in return in terms of food quality, conservation of the environment and animal welfare, the countryside and the farming landscape, and enhancing social balance and equity. For EU consumers and taxpayers, the review should ensure better value for money. We will be discussing these proposals in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning specifically to protein crop production, let me remind you that we propose introducing a separate supplementary aid of EUR 55.57 per hectare. We also envisage integrating the aid schemes for grain legumes and dried fodder into the list of decoupled aids. The current provisions on non-food crops will be replaced by non-specific aid for energy crops. The mid-term review of the CAP gives us a chance in the context of the new round of WTO negotiations to oblige our trading partners to accept our demands on, for example, the recognition of registered designations of origin, animal welfare, food safety and the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Our new system of income support dependent on production output will avoid distorting trade and should not have a negative impact on the developing countries. Unlike the situation during the Uruguay Round, the European Union will be in a position to take an active part in negotiating the agriculture chapter of the WTO Doha Round, fortified by a strong negotiating stance and a level of credibility which the United States has lost with its recent farm bill.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say something on the feed ban relating to fishmeal. The extended feed ban prohibits the use of fishmeal intended for ruminants, not because of a potential TSE risk of fishmeal itself, but for control reasons, as we have discussed here on a number of occasions. In particular it may be difficult to exclude the presence of land animal proteins in fishmeal or feed containing fishmeal. The reallowance of fishmeal in ruminant feed therefore mainly depends on the availability of methods of differentiate between fishmeal and prohibited animal proteins. Several researchers are working on this at the moment and I believe there is an opportunity to revisit this particular issue under the comitology procedure that is set out in the animal by-products regulation for which I have responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate on this matter at the current juncture in the European Union requires me to make an assessment of the problem and a suggestion for its resolution. The assessment is, unfortunately, easy to make, given that it concerns the extremely vulnerable situation the European Union is in, being only 23% self-sufficient, as indeed the report states. What is at issue is not only the fact that one of the most powerful blocs in the world – the European Union – has a production sector that is so highly dependent on the supply of raw materials from outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also at issue, apart from this high degree of dependence with regard to raw materials for meat and milk production, is the fact that these imports are concentrated in only three countries, the United States, Argentina and Brazil, which are, of course, our main competitors in the world agri-food markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The enormous risk that we are running in the European Union, in terms of competitiveness, is, therefore, easy to see from the fact that sectors as important as these – meat and milk – are ultimately dependent on our main competitors. This does not make sense. The solution to this problem must involve three main measures, in line, in fact, with the rapporteur’s proposals. The first is to end the area limits imposed by Blair House. With the current WTO agreements coming to an end, and with the alignment of oilseed aid to that of cereals from the beginning of the current season, there are clearly no more reasons for self-imposed limits. The second reason, or the second measure, is that due to the excessive deficit specifically in the plant protein sector, the current increase in aid must be maintained or, if possible, increased. With this aid differential and without the area limits (the semi-area imposed by Blair House), we will be able to improve our situation within a few years. And the third reason, also mentioned in the report, is that a review must be undertaken of the ban on fishmeal in ruminant feeds, following a proper scientific study.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to state that, in addition to the importance of plant proteins in the European Union’s food production chain, we must stress the strategic importance of these crops in the European Union’s Mediterranean areas, where the choice of crops is limited, and where, above all, there are few crops that provide farmers with options, but where these particular crops adapt very well to the unproductive land and the predominant soil in these areas, which is poor, limited and marginal. It would, therefore, be necessary to extend the range of eligible crops, as the rapporteur also states, because it is incredible and unacceptable that the main varieties of plant proteins from the Mediterranean regions are not currently eligible for aid. This situation must be reviewed. Lastly, I would like to add that we also need to see what the relationship is between this Commission communication and the new proposals for a mid-term review of the CAP, which provide for a separate production aid system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the result of a very long period of work, carried out intelligently, taking account of the opinion of his fellow Members and the experts we have heard within the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I sincerely thank Mr Stevenson.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of plant protein supply for the European Union obviously involves economic factors, but also, and more importantly, it involves strategic aspects relating to the nature of the European agricultural model and the role played by this model in external trade. We should be aware that we import almost 80% of the plant proteins required to fulfil our needs and that this heavy reliance cannot be approached solely from the point of view of the commercial interests at the time. Aside from the current matter of GMOs in imported soya proteins, we must ask ourselves what would happen in Europe if, for whatever reason, whether due to climate or other reasons, the supply from the United States, Brazil and Argentina were to be cut off. Commissioner, those affected by the American embargo in 1973, as I was, are aware of the price of this reliance and cannot tolerate the level of risks run today. Paradoxically, although demand is high in Europe, production here is stagnating, or even decreasing, and the worst thing is that the European Union does not seem determined to remedy this situation properly. Of course we can examine your proposals on the introduction of a ‘carbon credit’, which are a step in the right direction. The impact of this credit could, however, be limited by its small scale, and discontinuing the use of set-aside land for non-food crops might not be compensated for by the move towards some energy crops being produced by workers’ cooperatives. The various measures you are advocating on behalf of the Commission to adapt Agenda 2000 to current needs do not seem sufficient to address the current problems. This failure is both serious and regrettable. Without going so far as to set the unrealistic objective of total self-sufficiency, the European Union could still reduce its reliance on external suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is why I ask you to examine more carefully the recommendations of the Stevenson report, which I, indeed we, find relevant. They were unanimously approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I recommend in particular that you pay attention to those advocating greater investment in research into the protein sector under the 6th FRDP and those concerning the introduction of plant protein-producing crops in cereal crop rotation. I believe the same applies to the security of our long-term supply and the promotion of sustainable agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the conclusions and the diagnosis. It is therefore cause for concern that EU self-sufficiency in plant proteins has fallen to below 23%. Market-related price relationships have made it advantageous to buy imported oilseed cake, especially soya meal, but climatic risks and changes to production in those countries from which we supply ourselves make the EU all too vulnerable. The EU therefore needs to increase its self-sufficiency by cultivating oil-bearing plants, and I am also able to endorse the various initiatives put forward by the rapporteur in his report. Nor shall I omit to alert the Commission to the fact that the arrangements made specifically impair the European grain market by making it possible to import cheap grain from Russia and that they simply contribute to making plant production less profitable financially. At the same time, the lower grain prices in Europe give rise to an increase in pig breeding which in turn requires higher imports of soya meal. This initiative therefore promotes neither European plant cultivation nor European production of proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that there is no proper scientific basis for the ban on fishmeal mentioned by the Commissioner. It is not technically correct to argue that, because of a fear of meat and bone meal from ruminants being mixed with fishmeal, it is necessary to keep fishmeal out of the protein supply. We must say to those countries which are in control of their production – that is to say, those countries which really can keep the production of proteins separate – that they must of course also be given an advantage so that those countries which cannot keep the production of proteins separate are not those which impose penalties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the document we are now debating states, the European Union’s current rate of self-sufficiency in vegetable proteins has fallen to below 23%, as other Members have already said and which becomes all the more serious when you realise that, at world level, plant protein production has increased by 60% in the last fifteen years and is largely concentrated in three countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, hard to understand the Commission position of insisting on depending almost solely on the world market, with the aggravating circumstance that this supply is concentrated in three countries, and I would remind you that one of these is the United States of America. I would also take this opportunity to remind you of that country’s agricultural policy, which is not only in competition with the European Union but which is also protectionist. This fact puts the European Union in an extremely vulnerable position and is not a sustainable response to our needs in terms of plant proteins, as the rapporteur points out in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, important that we encourage the development of plant protein production in the European Union, which will help to make us less dependent on imports and to ensure the multifunctionality of Community agriculture, introducing other species and varieties of grain legumes which have inexplicably been excluded from Community support and from the improvement plans. I would remind you of yellow lupin and other species that have traditionally been used for animal feed, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, and which have not benefited from Community support.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of granting rotational aid to farmers to encourage the production<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>of plant proteins in the cereal crop cycle, using fallow land, as we have advocated in other reports, and also the need to terminate the Blair House agreements, or, at the very least renegotiate them. It is hard to understand why no effort has yet been made to renegotiate them, in the aim of terminating them, thereby making greater direct aid possible for the protection of proteins in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is equally important for the Commission to approve the additional aid for plant proteins – beans, peas and lupins – not covered by the Blair House agreements and we support the terms referred to in the report by the our rapporteur. We hope, then, that the Commission will take account of these proposals, whilst respecting the principle of monitoring production and the positive effects of these, in both the socio-economic and the environmental fields. I would also remind you that now, when it comes to revising the CAP, neither this report nor the proposals that will surely be approved here in the European Parliament must be forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an overall shortage of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, particularly of protein crops, and deficits in the area of protein production. Our concern is, then, with the recovering of areas for the production of protein, and this we can achieve through protein cultivation in rotation – the ecological distribution of crops. If, in the new proposal, you provide for the permanent set-aside of 10% in order to protect nature, then there can certainly be no objection to incorporating 5%-10% into this category in order also to take account of factors that determine the character of the landscape. In the other set-aside areas, though, we must focus on the environmental impact of protein cultivation and on the fact that this cultivation of protein yields 40 to 80 kilos. We need to look again here at how we achieve a monitoring system and how, too, we can incorporate environmental factors into the negotiations with the Americans in such a way that we come to a new agreement and are not permanently obliged to refer back to one that dates back ten years -– by which I mean Blair House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aftermath of the BSE crisis and the ban on the use of meat and bonemeal has left a serious, sharp fall of proteins in animal feed and must be filled by other means. We all know that the lesson we have learned from that particular crisis in European farming is that we must have a food chain that guarantees the highest possible standards of traceability and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not really enamoured by the Commission's proposals to address this situation. The suggestion by the Commission that we should source the feedstuffs shortfall on world markets is not a realistic long-term solution. We should produce those feedstuffs within the EU where we can and would be in a position to control each element of the food chain. This is beside the fact that home production offers a number of other distinct advantages. It allows our farmers to diversify their production and to produce crops for which there is a clear and demonstrable market. This would offer welcome assistance in their current plight.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also have serious concern about the long-term desirability of becoming dependent on outside sources for our feedstuffs. One of the fundamentals of the CAP is to guarantee a secure supply of high-quality foodstuffs for our citizens and I hope that the Commission will take on board the concerns of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which will no doubt be supported by a strong majority in this House tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Driven by a desire to cut costs and increase production, the cattle feed industry has completely ignored the order of creation. Cows became cannibals and the animals’ nature was no longer taken into consideration. The Commission was right to introduce a ban on the use of animal meal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission does take account of each animal's individuality and does not buckle under the pressure from industry to re-admit the use of fishmeal in animal feed. I have never seen a cow by a ditch, looking for fish. Given the poor fish stocks, it is a mark of even less insight if fishermen are encouraged to supply young fish to the fishmeal industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, calls on the Commission to promote the growth of crops containing protein so as to replace animal meal. I wholeheartedly support him in this appeal, particularly also to protect the EU from imports of genetically modified soy, which is, again, an organism whose characteristics are not being taken seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First and foremost, it is a food security issue. European consumers quite rightly require all the elements of the food chain to be traceable. In the case of the protein fodder needed for livestock farming, Europe cannot be content to rely on external supply for more than three quarters of its needs. Community production must regain a dominant share of the market in order to avoid risks relating to residues, contaminants or GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has decided to apply a moratorium prohibiting the use of new GMOs in foodstuffs for humans and animals. We know, however, that soya-exporting countries mainly grow GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the quantitative security of the world market. The supply of protein fodder is concentrated in a very small number of countries, primarily the United States, which represents 45% of world production, and 90% of pressing is carried out by four industrial groups. If a meteorological disaster were to occur, Europe would be in an extremely vulnerable position.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this market is growing by 5% per year, and it would be even more senseless for Europe not to be involved in this growth since internal demand within the Union, including demand in the future Member States, where meat consumption will increase on accession, is destined to experience sustained growth.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a significant environmental issue. Let us not forget that increased cultivation of protein-rich oil plants fosters biodiversity, improves soil structure, counters the tendency towards single-crop cultivation and reduces the use of chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing protein shortfall in the Union should, therefore, be a matter of the utmost priority for the Commission. This, however, is not the case at all. In response to these issues, and in order to replace animal meal, the Commission is merely proposing that we resign ourselves to seeing an increasing percentage of our consumption rely on imports, over which we would have no control with regard to price, production conditions, or compliance with the social and environmental specifications we impose on our own farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite simply, this is unacceptable. That is why our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pursued a far more dynamic strategy in adopting the Stevenson report, which aims to infuse a little political will into the feeble Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments we tabled in Committee emphasise the contrast between the seriousness of the European situation and the substantial subsidies implemented by the United States, in particular within the framework of the Farm Bill in favour of their oilseed crop producers. They ask the Commission to examine how to renegotiate the Blair House agreement with a view to increasing protein production s in the Union and to augmenting supplementary aid for protein crops that are not affected by the Blair House agreement. They suggest setting up a safety net in favour of oilseed and protein crop producers and lastly, undertaking the necessary research work into these crops.</p>

The BSE crisis and the resultant ban on the use of animal bonemeal in feed have significantly increased the demand for replacement source of protein in the area of animal feedingstuffs. The shortage of plant protein is made a live issue by the EU's low level of self-sufficiency, to which reference is often made these days.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation makes a European protein plan urgently necessary in order to promote the cultivation of protein plants, thereby reducing our dependence on imports and giving us more varied sources of supply. I would bring to your attention the fact that the EU, the most significant importer in the world, gets by far and away most of its plant proteins from the USA, Argentina and Brazil, and that these are very often genetically modified ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern here is not only with the cultivation of soya and rape, but to an equal degree with seed flax, camelina and many other plant proteins. It is for that reason that I attach particular importance to the products' traceability, in order for transparency to give consumers choice, quality and confidence that the food is safe. Over and above this, the cultivation of protein-rich cultures contributes to the diversity of crop rotation by making it possible to reduce input and by preventing the rise of monocultures.</p>
<p class="contents">If it were possible to utilise set-aside areas, that would be a practical approach. Whilst, of course, safeguarding Budget neutrality, it is not only cultivation of organic areas that needs to be promoted, as the Commission proposes, but conventional agriculture should also have the opportunity to cultivate plant proteins, fodder legumes and so on, in their fields, benefiting from the EU's environmental programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The production of oilseeds for use in biofuels and building materials gives, in fact, further significant impetus to agriculture. What I seek at the international level is for the Blair House agreement to be at last seriously reconsidered and for all parties to see the urgent necessity of facilitating the production of plant protein in the EU in accordance with the regulations. I do believe that a genuinely serious discussion on this has to be set in train at European level, for we are well aware that biofuels are environmentally friendly and can also be produced without prior energy input. Whilst remaining within the financial framework, the EU needs to promote the use of plants in protein production with the minimum possible delay, in order to secure an independent supply of protein for farmers and European agriculture, facilitate energy generation and thus reduce our dependence on fossil energy. We are all aware that Europe imports something like 60% of its energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore consider it to be extremely appropriate, Mr President, that both Commissioner Byrne, who is responsible for food safety, and the Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr Fischler, have attended this debate. The European Parliament has reflected the importance of the matter and has dedicated extensive debates to it as well as two parliamentary hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of all of this, wills have been united and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of this report with an extremely broad consensus, and it today comes before the plenary without a single amendment. I congratulate Mr Stevenson on his magnificent work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission ought to accept this extremely representative vote and this unity of position because, Mr Fischler, the position of the European Parliament is quite clearly reflected in paragraph 3, which says ‘The European Parliament recommends that the development of<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>EU plant protein production should be encouraged to reduce its<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>reliance on imports and to sustain the multi-functionality of Community agriculture’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In order for this position to develop to its full potential and to become a reality, it is absolutely crucial for the Commission to implement what is asked of it in paragraph 5: ‘...the Commission should fund an extensive research and development programme’ because unless it does fund a programme into the increased genetic and yield potential, utilisation and nutritive value of fodder<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>legumes and grain legumes as key protein providers within the EU, what we will have are words rather than deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, Mr President, Recitals F and I draw attention to the Mediterranean areas, which Commissioner Fischler very frequently overlooks. It has been said more than once in today’s plenary sitting that he must review this position, because these areas must receive aid for this purpose too, so that the production of grain legumes for livestock breeding in the Mediterranean areas of the European Union can also have highly beneficial effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I wish to note the importance of the suggestion made in Recital D that we must take account of the difficulties currently facing Argentina, in order not to make that country’s situation worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are matters that have to be, and can be, resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The most crucial question, however, is whether to support the production of plant proteins in the EU Member States or not. That is the question we first have to tackle and then make the very profound and fundamental decision that it must be supported. We cannot embark on a programme of unprofitable production, and with that in mind Mr Garot has submitted the proposal that we should carry out research and move forward on the basis of that. Research brings with it the possibility that there will actually be a demand for our own plant proteins. Demand will raise prices and prices give a boost to cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems must be resolved and we hold the key to the solution. Why can we not provide solutions? Why is that? Everyone is a little wary: everyone is out to safeguard their own interests a bit too much. We need to have a broader view and provide a comprehensive solution instead of hiding behind excuses the whole time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to bioenergy and plant proteins, for example, the solution is very simple. All we need to do is pass resolutions and resolve problems of taxation. These sorts of procedures will result in a comprehensive solution leading to our own plant protein energy programme in Europe, one that is not dependent on the United States, Brazil or Argentina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, coupled with the Commission's insistence on abiding to the letter by the GATT agreement and Agenda 2000, which ban any increase on plant protein crops, reveals in all its glory the hypocrisy of the Commission, which is using every environmental excuse it can under Agenda 2000 in a bid to reduce agricultural output. And the same time, it demonstrates just how far the Commission is prepared to kowtow to the interests of the fodder production and marketing industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe there is an alternative to meat and bonemeal, which causes public health, livestock and the Community budget nothing but grief. Nor is imported soya meal, mainly from the USA, the answer, because it will cause even more public health problems and make Community livestock farmers even more dependent on the United States of America. The solution to the problem lies in plant proteins, which can be grown in abundance in the European Union, in Greece and in other countries in the south, and in increasing crops of legumes, beans, alfalfa, vetch and cotton cake which, along with several other products. provide some of the best fodder. But this means changing the system of prices and subsidies for both fodder legumes and competing crops. It means completely overhauling the budget and rethinking the development criteria of the agricultural economy, i.e. changing the present Common Agricultural Policy, which has caused the agricultural sector such misery, especially in the southern countries where, unfortunately, we have no alternative but to focus on certain crops, such as cotton, resulting in serious problems for cotton growers in Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission argues that amending the current policy could lead to legal proceedings being instituted against us in the WTO, something that should not concern us, given the protectionist attitude of the Bush administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is no doubt that our animal-feed industry and, ultimately, our livestock production and our food depend, to a large extent, on just one product: soya, the production and trading of which are under the control of the United States. How can the European Union allow this enormous strategic dependence to continue?</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining or increasing imports of these products which are not surplus to requirements, such as non-genetically modified soya and corn from developing countries, must be an important part of our cooperation policy but, at the same time, it must also be a priority to promote self-sufficient and sustainable agri-breeding systems within the least-favoured regions of the European Union, which create employment and sustain the rural population, primary genetic resources and the necessary production of biofuels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the ban on meat-and-bone meal, which lay at the root of the mad cow crisis, the Community shortfall of protein-based feed for livestock has grown worse. As some of my fellow Members have said, it has increased by 23%. Faced with this deficit, the only solution that the European Commission has proposed is to increase imports of these protein crops, an increase that will grow worse after the new Member States have joined the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s Executive has rejected the memorandum presented during the recent Spanish Presidency and supported by many Member States, in favour of promoting these crops in the European Union, despite the fact that we are increasingly dependent on soya from the United States. This dependence could, furthermore, increase, following the increase in aid granted by that country under its new agricultural law.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the United States is quite unabashed about increasing its annual aid to soya producers by USD three million, the European Union is not only reducing its aid to oilseed crops, but is also putting its market at the service of imports from these third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from commercial reasons, however – which the European Commission wishes to bandy around in order to justify its refusal to re-establish specific aid for oilseed crops – there is no reason not to support other crops with a protein content higher even than that of oilseed crops, such as dry fodder, in the case of which production quotas cannot match demand.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to address protein supply needs, there are also other crops, such as protein and leguminous crops – such as kidney beans, beans and sweet lupins, which have already been mentioned – which are not subject to any type of WTO restriction and which we could also include.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be forgotten, furthermore, that the European Union has given a commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, and that one possible approach is to promote the production of biofuels, which is another reason why the European Parliament should support the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in favour of promoting these crops and of reducing, if not eliminating, these external dependencies, which can cause so many problems with regard to the degree of supply and the quality and safety monitoring of these crops under our rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a comment: Mr Commissioner, if we do not maintain our production and supply capacity, what will become of our ability to negotiate and defend our interests in international forums? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I will just take this opportunity to add a couple of comments on the issues that have emerged as the core of the debate. One of them has been addressed by a very large number of you, namely the issue of the European Union's dependence on imports from the USA. It must be clear to us that recent years have seen the production of soya transferred to a very large extent to South America. As we are dealing here with developing countries, this means that it is imports from developing countries that are ever increasing in recent years. If I include the financial year that has just begun, we can take it for granted that, for example, the number of Latin American exporters has all but doubled over the past two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Second comes the issue of GMOs. Our position is in tune both with the current legal provisions and with the latest Commission proposals on traceability and labelling. The only genetically modified soya bean to be marketed internationally is already approved in the EU; it is called <span class="italic">Round-up Ready</span>, and is a genetic modification that we have approved in the EU under Directive 90/220. The only other genetically modified type of soya in the USA and worldwide contains a high percentage of oleic acid and is subject in the USA to strict trademark safeguards, being capable of being sold at very high prices by reason of its health-giving properties. The latest proposal on traceability and labelling does not provide for the labelling of any animal products produced using GM feedstuffs. It does, though, make provision for the traceability of feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of international relevance is the issue of the Blair House agreement. It has repeatedly been urged in this House that we should renegotiate the Blair House agreement. My response to that today is what it has always been, namely that, if we want to renegotiate the Blair House agreement, we have to be told what we are to offer the USA in order to get them to move away from their position. This has generally put a stop to debate, even in the Agriculture Council, nobody of course being prepared to accept other concessions at the expense of the concessions we have gained on soya beans. It has been suggested that we should deal with this issue as part of the mid-term-review debate; I believe this to be a good and important suggestion, and one that I am happy to take on board. This is something we should do, as we cannot but observe it happening in other contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we now have the debate about defining soya as a protein plant rather than as an oilseed as it was in the past, which would mean that soya could be looked at squarely when considering the protein plant rules, in which we envisage a specific premium for the production of protein plants. Of course, that also has an international dimension, but right now I am in favour of discussing the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue raised here, namely the set-aside problem, falls within the scope of the mid-term-review in precisely the same way. In that connection, land is still to lie fallow or be set aside on a rotating basis.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two reasons why our proposal on the mid-term review does not provide for land to lie fallow on a rotating basis. One is that we take the view that, in a decoupled system, leaving land fallow or setting it aside should primarily be determined by environmental considerations, although it may be, in view of the tragic events we have lived through over recent weeks in connection with various floods in Europe, that other new issues will come into play. I am very much aware that the rotation of fallow land is in itself an environmentally positive factor, as it makes it possible to make full use of the effectiveness of legumes as a forecrop.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second problem is that, if we continue to permit land to lie fallow or be set aside across the whole of the usable agricultural area, we will find it difficult to monitor. This issue will have to be discussed, as we must not lose sight of the possibility of simplifying our system of arable farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the many suggestions made by Mr Stevenson in his report are of great value. As my fellow-Commissioner, Mr Byrne, has already, to my knowledge, answered certain questions, particularly those concerning fishmeal, that is something I do not need to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
