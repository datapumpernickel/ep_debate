Now we are going to talk about maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The package we are going to discuss today constitutes the penultimate phase and naturally supplements the work carried out over the last four years. I would like to remind the honourable Members that, in December 1999, we faced the <span class="italic">Erika </span>accident, a tragedy which you are all well aware of; then we had the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>accident. As a result of these two accidents, the citizens of the different European countries have looked to Europe and demanded responses.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken many very important steps, and I believe we can safely say that during this legislature there has been a revolution in maritime safety in the European Union and a spectacular improvement in the guarantees of protection for our coasts and our citizens. Today, Europe can say that it has a system which is at least equivalent to those of the best protected countries in the world, and now there is no country in the world with more stringent measures, unlike the situation four and a half years ago. The risks and the seas are different, but we finally have a genuinely ambitious and appropriate system.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to make progress and today we are going to debate a fundamental element in the mechanism to combat and prevent the pollution caused by ships, namely the system of sanctions for pollution offences for which a part of the directive establishes a framework, and then there is the instrument in the criminal field.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2003, the Commission presented its proposed directive on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions, including of a criminal nature, for pollution offences. Through this proposed directive, the Commission intends to essentially achieve three objectives: firstly, to define within Community law the concept of the illegal dumping of polluting substances in the sea; the proposal intends to incorporate into our legislation the provisions of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, that is, the Marpol Convention. Secondly, to guarantee that the people responsible for illegal dumping – not just captains and ship owners, but also charterers and classification societies, which in some cases be responsible for these actions – may be prosecuted and also be subject to penalties in certain circumstances. And, thirdly, precisely defining the conditions under which responsibility may be established for each of the parties involved; the Commission believes that criminal responsibility may be established when spills are intentional and also, in the event of an accident, if the spill is due to serious negligence. In other words, intention and serious negligence.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know, in May last year, the Commission also presented a proposed framework Decision on pollution from ships. This second proposal supplements the proposed Directive and essentially regulates the criminal aspects, that is, harmonisation in the field of sanctions and issues of judicial cooperation on criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the principle of incrimination and the imposition of the corresponding sanction must be established legally and, in the Commission’s view, by means of the directive, which, in accordance with the Treaties in their current form, is the only genuinely effective instrument for truly incorporating sanctions into the law of all the Member States and will therefore be an effective deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">The three objectives I have referred to are clear, viable and, in our view, inescapable. Nevertheless, for certain Members States, the proposed Directive which is currently on the table goes too far: they see its objectives as overly ambitious. The Council has not yet laid out its position in this regard, but I have heard the doubts of the majority of ministers, who are not convinced that we should continue along this route. Some have the clear intention of greatly reducing the ambitions contained in the Commission’s proposed Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I must confess that the work in the Council is a great disappointment to me. The work is moving very slowly and the delay has meant that we cannot respond either to the expectations of our fellow citizens or to the demands of the Heads of State or Government, who had called for Parliament and the Council to adopt this Directive before the end of 2003. I am convinced that I can once again count on the support of this House. The position Parliament adopts will be a determining factor and will contribute to moving the situation forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to the third issue, relating to the transfer of ships between European Union registers. As well as the aspects relating to criminalisation – the treatment or punishment of certain actions in the field of sea pollution and dumping – we are going to discuss the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between Community registers.</p>
<p class="contents">Twelve years after the adoption of the current regulation, it is urgent – in accordance with our experiences and within the context of the imminent enlargement of our Community fleet – to update the oldest text of our acquis in the field of maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the current regulation, only cargo ships can be included under certain conditions in the intended system. And the main objective of the Commission's proposal is for passenger ships also to benefit from quick transfer between the registers of Community States in a manner which is less burdensome for our operators, thereby improving the operation of the sector and making it more competitive. This will obviously be carried out while maintaining the high level of maritime safety resulting from the international conventions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this objective, the proposal intends to improve the circulation of information amongst maritime administrations in the States of the Union to better coordinate the system applicable to transfers between registers with the Community acquis, particularly with the Directives on controls by the port state and classification societies which we have adopted in the <span class="italic">Erika </span>packages.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate in the Council has demonstrated the consensus which exists on the need to strengthen their current system of change of register. The modifications contained in the text of the Council’s general guidelines of 5 December 2003 contribute to defining the scope of the Regulation and, by coordinating it better with the detention and denial of access procedures in the Directive on control by the port state. The Commission fully agrees with these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with these two packages of measures, we are taking a final step in improving and strengthening maritime safety within the European Union, an area in which I believe we have made considerable progress during this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its systematic support for the measures we have been proposing and also for its cooperation and contribution of positive proposals throughout this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bremmer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is a striking coincidence that this afternoon should find us discussing air and maritime safety. Only this afternoon, Mr Pex, together with Mr Doorn and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, three members of the Dutch delegation, boarded a small plane whose brakes failed and which subsequently collided with a hangar, as a result of which he cannot make it here on time. I have been asked for that reason to present his contribution to the House. When I therefore talk about 'me', I am talking on behalf of Mr Pex, who, incidentally, is doing fine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of major importance that the discharge of oil at sea should be prevented. Disasters cause significant discharges, which are, with good reason, given a great deal of attention. Illegal discharges, however, from vessels other than tankers, also constitute a major problem, especially because they occur frequently and are rarely traced. In the few cases when discharges are traced, there are very few prosecutions, and hardly any punishment. That is a perplexing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive that is currently under discussion should rectify this situation without delay. There are sufficient rules internationally to address the situation. The problem is, however, that Member States flout the rules to which they have committed themselves in treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is to include internationally valid discharge regulations in Community law and make provisions for enforcement rules. Infringements must be given the character of offences in respect of which it must also be possible to prosecute according to criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the disaster involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, Heads of Government have asked on two occasions, namely on 21 March and 13 December of 2002, strict measures to be introduced before the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission submitted a sound proposal on time, which I – Mr Pex – have been able to correct with the help of fellow Members from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, along with the co-advisory committees via a number of amendments. I thank the Commission and the fellow Members for the pleasant collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few observations regarding the proposal. The European rules must apply to all illegal discharges on inland waterways and at sea, both inside and outside of the territorial waters. It is important not only to be critical <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the shipping crew, but also mainly <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the ships' owners and the authorities on land. A common European coast guard is desirable in order to trace discharges more effectively and for the authorities to act more quickly and more adequately. For both this coast guard and the already established European Maritime Agency (EMSA), it is important to have sufficient powers to enhance safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten amendments have been tabled in respect of the text of my report that has been approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Of these ten, I am happy to adopt the two technical amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx, because their intention is to clarify the text. As I have already stated, the introduction of criminal sanctions is a good instrument. Unfortunately, the self-same Council that requested them, is now not prepared to accept this proposal, because it is believed that criminal law falls within the remit of the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I as rapporteur have tried to work together with the Council, because the prompt introduction of the measures is conducive to safety at sea, the Council cried off. It appears that in those circles, discussions of principle take precedence over safety at sea. In other words, the Council's conduct leaves something to be desired. The Heads of Government who have asked for measures on two occasions should take action to make swift introduction still possible. It would be preferable if this were done now rather than when a new disaster occurs, which Heaven forbid.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of Mr Pex, I am able to say: ‘I have spoken’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poignant (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that our legislature will have seen important steps forward in maritime safety and I would like to congratulate the Commission on its work. For me, the duty, or rather the right, to criticise you when necessary goes hand in hand with the duty to congratulate you when appropriate. And so far as safety at sea is concerned, I think the Commission has performed its task well and served the European general interest. While this report is not the greatest of all reports, it must nevertheless be seen as one of the achievements of the last four years. Having said that, the task has not been completed and you only have to read the Sterckx report to see how much a new legislature will be necessary in order to complete the work.</p>
<p class="contents">However that may be, the starting point is simple: every vessel has a flag that belongs to a country, since there is no European flag. A move was made in that direction 15 years ago, but nothing ever came of it. The first text on changing registers goes back more than 10 years. The Commission proposal and the accompanying report by Parliament seek to adapt to the new situation, because a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. Like the Commission text, this report has three main thrusts. Firstly, it includes passenger ships. They were not included in the first directive for the reason given at the time, namely that the rules differed greatly from one State to another. That is why our committee and Parliament did not include passenger ships in the text at that time. Since then, however, a lot of important decisions have been taken – I am thinking in particular of the SOLAS convention – a lot of improvements have been made, rules have been aligned on many points, and it therefore seems appropriate now to include passenger ships in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thrust of the report involves a very similar argument, since it is about coordinating Community instruments in the area of maritime safety, in short integrating all the legislation that has been adopted piecemeal, in particular the packages known as Erika I and Erika II. Finally, the third thrust seeks to increase cooperation between national maritime authorities. These are therefore the three thrusts of my report, which, of course, correspond to those of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is important to complete these reforms, it is also because Europe is about to grow and enlarge to take in ten new states. May I remind you that we are, indeed, about to welcome 10 States, but two in particular are island States with very large fleets, Malta and Cyprus, and it seems a good idea to get these rules settled before 1 May 2004. That is why the text should be adopted after just one reading in Parliament, as we did for single hulls at the time, so as not to lose time but to make maritime safety the objective rather than fighting over pure and simple questions of procedure, the idea being to find the most intelligent compromise, or at the very least the least stupid one possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments have been tabled by the Council, and your rapporteur proposes that they be adopted since they do not change the substance of the text. Some are technical changes, for example, specifying the ships to which the regulation does not apply, warships in particular. Some amendments also allow States to apply rules different from those of the SOLAS convention provided they are no less strict, while other amendments require each State to present an annual report and insist on the first of them to facilitate the implementation of the regulation. The most important demand comes from the Commission, which is insisting that, unlike other vessels, a vessel that has been detained more than once following an inspection in a port during the three years preceding the application for change of register should not be able to benefit from a simplified procedure. In short, it is a precaution for ships that have shown a number of weaknesses when controls were carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our colleagues has tabled an amendment seeking to have the emblem of the Union appear on the flag that changes register. I think that is a nice symbolic amendment and our committee voted in favour, but the Council does not want to adopt the amendment because it would only apply to vessels changing register and not to all of them. I am willing to abandon it, but I hope that one day the emblem of the Union will appear on our vessels’ flags so that, while the national flag will still appear, the little corner of Europe, too, will cross the seas of the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of this report and I hope it will have your backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we deplore is, instead, that there is still no overall legislation on protection of the environment through criminal law and, in fact, the conflict between the Council and the Commission, with the well-known subsequent appeal to the Court of Justice has crushed hopes, at least for us environmentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, in the specific area of maritime pollution – this has already been said, and there is no need to repeat it – the proposal for a directive is extremely worthy of praise, as was Mr Pex’s work, which made considerable improvements to it. I believe, however, that this directive will only have an impact if there is the political will to enforce it, especially because recent history teaches us that European Union directives are almost always disregarded by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue is the lack of will on the part of Member States to respect these provisions and the fact that, I am sorry to say, immediate corrective action has to be taken today when there have been terrible disasters. The proposed framework decision is merely a complementary decision to the directive. There is an excellent agreement, and it is, therefore, necessary that both are welcomed by Parliament with all the amendments tabled which are, in my view, excellent, although I have some reservations as regards the European Coastguard, since the sketchy proposal for this body gives us some cause for concern. The substance of this directive does, however, go in the right direction although it must be made clear that this will not be enough unless there is an overall framework to protect the environment in general and without which maritime protection will continue to be granted a lower level of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to return to overall community legislation on the environment as a whole and I believe that the Council should be reasonable and adopt the proposal for a directive on protection of the environment through criminal law, which, I repeat, was blocked by an appeal to the Court of Justice. This would be an excellent step because we would have adequate maritime protection, which would, however, be within the framework of environmental protection that could be equally protected at a criminal level, since there is no doubt that criminal sanctions are most likely to make workers in the sector adapt to provisions. In my view, this directive goes in the right direction and does some justice to all the workers because it will bring many workers under full control that were hitherto excluded. We know very well that international conventions excluded from liability ship-owners and a whole range of people who were, in actual fact, directly and indirectly responsible, and we saw proof of this with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, where the only one to pay was a poor captain of a Greek vessel who, at least, did everything possible to avoid the disaster, whilst others should be charged regarding the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster and its repercussions<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree both with the report on the proposal for a directive and the report on the proposal for a framework decision, and I hope that Parliament will adopt them both. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We began by speaking about air safety and now we are moving on to maritime safety. We have been talking about these problems and about marine pollution for four years now and I hope that in a few years’ time we will not need to talk about them much more.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we can only hope so, but when, while watching French television last weekend, I again saw Atlantic beaches soiled by oil slicks (whether they came from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or from uncontrolled degassing on the high seas is not known), I said to myself that there is reason to question the effectiveness of the legislation we have been putting in place for four years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to add my voice to the compliments addressed to the Commissioner for the energy she has shown in trying to overcome the inertia of our governments and ministers in this field. If they had listened to her, I do not think we would be where we are now. We are here to support her and to demonstrate to our citizens once again that we really do want to put all this legislation in place and see that it is obeyed. We know only too well, however, that if legislation is to be obeyed there must be sanctions. We will not achieve anything so long as there are no sanctions or they are not enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have met this evening and I would like to congratulate the various authors of the texts that are the subject of this debate and say how important it is that we should define the crime of ‘illegal discharges’ and insist on the necessary coordination so that the Member States will at last work by common agreement. I will close by saying that the drafting of a clear follow-up document based on the work of the European Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Maritime Safety should enable us to give the Commissioner our support on these problems of marine pollution and responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not adding anything to what has already been stated, I would just say that I too support approval of a very strong initiative, which the Commission has made very effective in this direction, which we hope will find a convergence and a common direction within the Council too, as well as the completion, therefore, of legislation that we need and which, by accepting the proposals in question today, we will make our partial contribution, which will however be specific and important.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, I followed one of the reports as shadow rapporteur which make up a package – the report by Mr Poignant as regards the transfer of ships, not just cargo ships but also passenger ships between the various national naval registers – and I must stress the quality<span class="bold"> </span>and the usefulness of both this Commission proposal and Parliament’s reaction as set out in the Poigant report, which we fully support and we agree with the suggestions and guidelines that have, moreover, been confirmed this evening, on the possible acceptance of suggestions from both the Council and, on a point that I consider to be very important, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the text allowed us to put an end to the various Conventions being interpreted differently and will, therefore, contribute to legal certainty by also simplifying the procedure for re-flagging passenger ships between registers and will, therefore, also lessen the regulatory burden within the EU and make it less bureaucratic. What is even more important, in my view, is that it ensures the control of safety aspects – which we see as indispensable – since the proposed procedure provides for, not only better cooperation and the exchange of information between national maritime authorities but, if necessary, additional inspections on ships: it was stressed how important this is in view of an enlargement that also includes countries, such as Malta and Cyprus, that are an important point of reference on this matter because of their traditions, commitment to production, and links between vessels and the fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to praise the rapporteur and the Commission proposal and, on behalf of my group, I give my full support to the positions that have been set out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate you on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a good proposal, and would also like to congratulate Mr Pex – who is unfortunately absent – on his fine report. We absolutely must do something about this. In 2001 alone, there were some thousand instances of illegal discharges into the North Sea and the Baltic, and this must no longer be regarded as a trivial offence and treated as such; it is not like wrongful parking or breaking the speed limit, and must at last be punished as a criminal offence under the criminal law – which means tough and painful penalties, such as fines, imprisonment, and, as the committee has requested, the seizure of vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur was right to point out that several laws adopted by Parliament and the Council have not yet been implemented. They have to do with port reception facilities and port state control.</p>
<p class="contents">If, Commissioner, you want to bring before the ECJ those states that have not properly transposed this directive, in order to bring this out into the open and thus to bring pressure to bear in order to get this directive transposed at last, then this House is behind you all the way. Even the best laws are ineffective unless they are enforced and monitored. For that we need a European coastguard, something else on which there is consensus in this House, for control in the ports is one thing, but it must be accompanied by control on the high seas. We have got used to the idea that it is quite normal to monitor lorries not only in yards, but also on the roads. In future, that must also be possible at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Council regards that as too ambitious. Such arguments must not be given a hearing. I believe that we must not encourage the Council’s tendency to hide behind formalities, but should compel it to act. If Europe comes together and acts in unison, then we will make progress in sea travel and maritime safety on an international basis too.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters is that we do everything not only to avoid disasters, but also to put an end to the toleration of deliberate, malicious and criminal acts in our waters. We can do something about them. We back you in doing so and are right behind you in your endeavour to publicly stigmatise the governments that do not do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a saying in Dutch to the effect that many small ones make a big one, by which token many small incidents of pollution are, in time, as important as a major disaster. I might add that we laid down the 'polluter pays' principle a long time ago, and I think that now is the time for us to also say that the 'polluter is penalised', which I think would be very justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the text adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in that it should be clearly stated that it is the illegal, deliberate discharges that are targeted, and not so much those resulting from accidents involving damage, for an accident is, after all, different from a deliberate discharge. I think that we should draw this distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piecyk pointed out a moment ago that there are already quite a few directives, such as the directive on port reception facilities, which my country has still not yet transposed. I see this as a disgrace and as a situation that we should rectify without delay. A year has now passed. In addition, we must get round to assessing its use, how ships themselves react to it and whether we should not make any changes anywhere to see whether – and if so, how – the directive works.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to refer to the monitoring directive and the use of the black box. We will have to see how we can apply the use of the black box to find out who pollutes, where pollution occurs, and, if necessary, how much pollution is involved. I think that this should also be taken into consideration, because this is a directive that can also be of importance in this connection. I am delighted that discharges on the high seas have been included in the text and that there are no geographical restrictions but that the sea is considered a common legacy which belongs to everyone and where pollution takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything hinges, of course, on inspections and on the way in which we catch the polluters in the act. I think that a European coastguard can be of some benefit here, or at least, before we reach that stage, improved mutual cooperation by national coastguards, inspections of ships' accounts and that sort of thing. If we can use a satellite to read the number plate of a suspect’s car in a given country, what stops us from using this kind of technology to trace discharge offences in time? When, for example, the <span class="italic">Tricolor</span> was salvaged, other ships took advantage of this accident to discharge their oil, for it was established that the oil that washed up did not originate from the <span class="italic">Tricolor</span>, but from other ships. We must, in any case, ensure that we draw a distinction between an accident and deliberate pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In shipping circles, there is disquiet about the treatment of shipping crew in some cases. In my view, what is happening with the captain of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is rather nasty, and I hope that we will be able to talk to him again shortly. I have read that a shipping disaster has now struck in Karaj and that the crew are being held criminally liable. We must be careful about this.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to say that we worked hard and managed to do a great deal in the previous session. It was frustrating on occasions. Before the <span class="italic">Erica</span> package was complete, we were hit by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, and that is very frustrating. However, Commissioner, I think that Parliament and the Commission, despite opposition from the Council, have managed to obtain a few positive results, and I hope that we can do the same in the next session.</p>

We know, however, that maritime pollution, from spillage of oil or other noxious substances, continues even when accidents do not occur. Illegal dumping and emptying of tanks, either on the high seas or close to shore, must be subject to sanction. We also know that the fight against dumping will not only require more legislation, but also, more importantly, greater effective enforcement. In this way, Member States will have at their disposal the appropriate resources and equipment to ensure compliance with existing rules. What is needed is the abolition of flags of convenience, the maintenance of accurate and well-structured logs of a ship’s history, its movements and cargo, the establishment of shipping lanes further from coastlines, the adequate inspection of ships in port and better working and on-board safety conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the MARPOL Convention is ignored on a daily basis by a large number of ships sailing in EU waters, since the principal objective of certain shipowners and oil companies is to obtain maximum profit at minimum cost. However, the fight against pollution discharges requires not only effective measures at EU level and greater cooperation between Member States, but also more effective enforcement at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating an EU coastguard will not solve this problem, and nor will it solve the problem of the lack of adequate resources for ship-sourced waste or the requirement for ships to use such resources. What is needed is for directives and other legislation in place to be enforced, including the system of information and monitoring – already set out in another directive – specifically as regards the installation of data recording devices for journeys on certain ships, without which it is difficult to prove the guilt or innocence of a ship’s crew, who must be considered innocent until proven guilty. It is also essential that crews be adequately trained and employees’ rights guaranteed. Ships must also be built more robustly. Member States and their governments must also assume full responsibility for abiding by the various conventions and directives in force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the past Christmas break, a striking number of dead sea birds have once again been found on the North Sea beaches. This is no coincidence. Indeed, every winter, around this time, there is an increase in the number of illegal discharges at sea. These are done by captains who are not so strict when it comes to adhering to regulations and who know that there is less monitoring during this period and that winter storms mean that the oil does not leave a clear trail.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why this report is so important. Europe must act. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Pex report we are discussing now, because it is a considerable improvement on the draft directive that indicates that Europe is now finally making out a case for attaching a penalty to maritime environmental crimes, including those committed outside its territorial waters. We therefore reject the Council’s arguments according to which this subject falls within the scope of the third pillar. How will the Commission react to this? How will the Commission react if the Council formally refuses to accept the directive’s introduction of criminal sanctions? The accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> brought out sentiments to that effect, because we also want to deal with the port authorities regarding environmental damage arising after a ship that is in difficulty is refused entry to a port or a safe haven. A European coastguard is necessary in order to make prosecution truly possible. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will be voting on a proposal tabled by my group to link this Pex directive to the Bouwman directive concerning port facilities. In that way, we enhance the traceability of polluters. Furthermore, we would ask for your support for other amendments, such as the involvement of the EMSA during the implementation of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very often rust-bucket, single-hull, decaying tankers carry enormous quantities of oil which are, in effect, environmental weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot imagine what would have happened if such a disaster had occurred off the coast of Ireland. I do not know how we would have coped. There are a great many measures in place, as has been said here today. One we should insist on is that only double-hull ships be allowed in and around European waters. We need political will – which does not exist and is unlikely to exist – within the European Union to avoid a repeat of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well-known fact that all the maritime safety organisations are understaffed and underfunded. They will remain so, and, as a result, the safety of our seas will remain in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the pollution that occurs in Community waters, as has been said already, is either deliberate or avoidable. This type of action is nothing short of criminal and must therefore be dealt with by criminal sanctions. I am aware that criminal law is essentially a Member State competence and we must avoid taking a position that would seek to infringe Member States' rights in this area. Nonetheless, there is much to be recommended in the Commission's proposals and there is a clear way forward for harmonising criminal sanctions by means of a third-pillar instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">A second key element to ensuring a safer, cleaner maritime environment is the newly established European Maritime Safety Agency. This agency will have to play a major role in anti-pollution and ship security measures. The agency should be properly staffed and funded. It certainly is not at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw colleagues' attention to the initiative of a number of Member States along the Atlantic north-west to establish particularly sensitive sea areas. I hope that this initiative, tabled by Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, the UK and Belgium within the UN's International Maritime Organisation, will have the full support of all current and future Member States. This will allow progress to be made on the matter in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must be said that there is no doubt whatsoever that, without political will, nothing will change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To this day, the disaster involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> has continued to demonstrate this. An agreement has recently been reached within the IMO about the extent of an additional fund for damage caused by oil pollution. Comments have been made in that respect about possible contributors to that fund. I take the view that the proposals expressed in the reports by Mr Pex and Mr Di Lello Finuoli are a valuable addition to this regulation. Responsibilities are clearly indicated and unambiguous sanctions are imposed in the event of non-compliance. I am pleased that criminal sanctions form part of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less happy about the request to set up a European coastguard, because in my view, this concerns an extra layer of existing activities rather than a useful addition to tasks that individual coastguards are already carrying out. This also applies to the request in the Poignant report that ships under European flags should be given a clear, physical, EU designation. As long as we do not have a joint European shipping register, this does not strike me as useful. Moreover, it will lead to a delay in the discussion of this proposal with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside a few reservations, then, I take, on the whole, a very positive view of these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The threat of severe financial and criminal sanctions being credibly applied to all the players in the maritime transport chain is certainly the most effective form of prevention for dissuading those concerned from making use of dangerous ships. The observation on which that is based is a certain laxity in the matter of compliance with the rules on discharges on the part both of a section of the maritime sector and of certain port States and of flag States in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have strong reservations about the method used. In the first place, it is always dangerous to lay down rules – some of which are not consistent with the Marpol convention and which have severe financial implications – that will apply only to ships flying the flags of Member States of the Union when they are the least likely to cause pollution. Proposing the confiscation of a vessel flying a European flag when it is not possible to confiscate a third-country ship is to shoot ourselves in the foot.</p>
<p class="contents">If we did that, we would be discriminating against our own fleets, which come closest to meeting the standards. I can assure you they do not need that. That is why we must always give priority to the international level over the European level in matters of maritime safety. Those States of the Fifteen that wish to do so must therefore argue passionately and tirelessly for high standards, but ones that apply to all within the framework of the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that the texts before us make strangely little reference to the liability of the flag State. We know, however, that the principal threat to maritime safety will remain so long as flags of convenience are able to prosper by covering ships that are not inspected or are inspected by classification societies that are themselves ‘convenience’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the burning question when the director of the Maltese maritime authority, which was responsible for the registration of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, is ordered by his government to refuse to answer the summons of the judge investigating the case and when the authorities in the Bahamas are showing the most obvious lack of good will by constantly delaying publication of their report on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, a ship that was flying their flag. Our Temporary Committee absolutely must tackle this crucial question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to rule out the idea of European coastguards, which seems to me to smack more of ideology than of a realistic and appropriate approach to the problems. No one can say who would be authorised to mobilise and deploy such an instrument, which has a very direct bearing on the security of the Member States, assuming a way could ever be found to pay for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we should be strengthening the operational modes of command and coordination of the means of intervention available in countries like France and Great Britain, perhaps extending them and sharing the costs of the heavy equipment bought by those Member States that contribute more than others, and for the benefit of all, to the management of the shipping lanes that connect Europe to the world. That, Mr President, would be a clear manifestation of real European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The human and environmental costs of the economic warfare imposed on all the nations are devastating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the sea is a space without borders, governed by the principle of freedom of shipping, but our role is to make carriers aware of their responsibility and therefore to make them answer for their deeds. That is why it is important to ensure, with this framework decision, that appropriate sanctions, criminal sanctions in particular, are applied to the persons responsible for illegal discharges of hydrocarbons and noxious liquid substances. The Member States really must adopt strict common provisions and a robust system of criminal sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, let us be clear. The Member States are often not equal to their duties and responsibilities in this area. True, the European Union has already considerably strengthened its legislation on maritime safety, but most Member States have applied the first 1995 directive on the control of shipping using Community ports very poorly. Then, following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, in December 1999 the European Union adopted five major texts on maritime safety. The two legislative packages were adopted in an exceptionally short space of time, but on 19 November 2002, the day the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> was wrecked, only one Member State – Denmark – had transposed one of those five texts into its national law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council, the European Union expressed its determination to adopt every measure necessary to prevent a recurrence of such a disaster. The framework decision that we are going to adopt tomorrow complements the 2003 directive on pollution by ships, which was a first important step. The European Parliament’s Temporary Committee on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster was finally formed last December, after 10 months of obstruction. That committee will have to assess the responsibilities of the maritime authorities and governments of the Member States in the management of maritime disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We must find a solution that will ensure that the Member States comply with the measures adopted by the European Union in the field of maritime safety and agree to receive vessels in distress in harbours of refuge. I repeat, we must enforce every liability, be it private or public, involved in these environmental crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With effective action we will protect waters in which people bathe, safeguard the supply of clean fish to eat, and improve maritime ecology, especially in enclosed sea areas. Oil from ships is very dangerous in many ways and for that reason pollution offences must be dealt with firmly and by making those who contribute to them accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has reached an excellent conclusion, which Mr Sterckx’s amendments make more specific. There is one point I nevertheless cannot support as it stands: the proposal for a common coastguard goes just a bit too far. As the coastguard also has many other responsibilities, this should be considered in the wider context.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poignant has done some good work with regard to his own report. There is just one detail in it, however, that should be addressed. I too am in favour of ships displaying the emblem of the European Union. The amendment to display the emblem on national flags is problematic, however, as the rapporteur has also said himself. It would require a debate on flag legislation in the Member States. If this amendment is dropped, it will be possible to bring this whole issue to a swift conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the pretext of strengthening competition, it aims to increase the profits of the shipping industry by cutting back marine workers' wages and social rights and giving scandalous tax breaks to shipping companies in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation in the explanatory statement of the regulation in question, that the Member States re-consider the creation of a European shipping register, is a strategically important choice by big business in order to increase its profitability. This proposal was submitted by the Commission back in 1989. Its implementation today, apart from new profits for shipowners, will result in lower safety standards in maritime transport, with new dangers to human life and the environment. This will create the conditions for new crimes at sea, such as the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to strengthen the criminal framework for abolishing pollution from ships will do nothing to reduce crimes at sea, in that everything will be subjugated to safeguarding and increasing the profits of shipowners and big business in general, which controls the sources of energy and the means of transport and production.</p>
<p class="contents">We take this opportunity to call on the European Parliament to intervene and to force the P&amp;I Club and the companies which own the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and the <span class="italic">Tasman Spirit </span>to pay the fines for the two shipwrecks so that their crews, which are being held hostage as scapegoats in Spain and Pakistan respectively, can be released.</p>

It is not only a question of the sea being polluted, causing damage to fisheries. Often, the oil washes up on the land and pollutes our beaches. Equipment for easily removing waste oil must be set up in our ports. This should be funded by means of a general port duty so that there is no benefit in discharging oil into the sea instead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now proposes that penalties for illegal discharges now be transferred to EU law. There must indeed be penalties for illegal discharges. Illegal discharges into Danish waters must be penalised under Danish law. Illegal discharges into international waters must be punished by an international environmental court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that an EU coastguard be set up to track down the lawbreakers. In Denmark, polluters are monitored and traced by aircraft made available by the military. We therefore need neither EU law nor an EU coastguard with their attendant bureaucracy. We should, however, like to see the EU take the initiative in setting up an international environmental court under the auspices of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission suggests promoting the reflagging of ships by bringing passenger vessels under existing easy-going rules and by limiting what is termed the quarantine period. Reflagging would undermine the pioneering countries’ agreements on salaries, working conditions and safety. The ship owners would also evade the VAT and tax rules that fund the welfare state. That would be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal that ships’ flags should have the EU symbol with the twelve gold stars against a blue background in the top corners of their national flags is ridiculous. We cannot, unfortunately, support any of the proposals. Once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is the MARPOL convention, which is applied differently in the Member States as far as the sanctions imposed are concerned, which is why the initiative by the European Commission is useful, so that there is a uniform approach to the matter from the point of view of sanctions. Similarly, there is already a directive on the matter, Directive 2059 on facilities for receiving waste from ships, which is not applied fully by the Member States. This directive must be applied. It is not, of course, an excuse for those ships that discharge oil into the sea but, on the other hand, nor should the Member States only champion environmental protection on paper; they must also apply in practice the provisions which they themselves voted through on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are taking a positive step here and what I want to emphasise with regret is that the Council, having asked the European Commission to submit this regulation on sanctions in cases of illegal discharges of waste by ships, does not now appear to be prepared to proceed quickly, does not appear to be prepared to accept the Commission's and Parliament's proposals and appears to be delaying the whole procedure. On our behalf, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to emphasise this and highlight the negative stance by the Council, stating that we shall fight to the end so that the Pex report becomes reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems to me positive that this tragedy, which the Commission euphemistically describes as ‘an accident of great media interest’, should lead to significant legislative changes which lead to criminal prosecution in the event of illegal behaviour. But I am concerned that it may become generally accepted that by resolving the issue of illegal discharges we are resolving more than half of the problem of sea pollution with hydrocarbons, since the Commission states that the majority of that pollution is not due to accidents but to deliberate discharges.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fear that the future may lead us to forget the present and this is a disaster which has not yet come to an end, as demonstrated by the new slick of fuel oil which is currently reaching the French coasts or the 14 000 tonnes of fuel oil still contained in the wreck awaiting a solution. I therefore say that concern for the future must not make us legislators forget the present.</p>
<p class="contents">The present, ladies and gentlemen, means the three great questions which the citizens of my region are quite rightly still asking and which have not received a European response: compensation for the parties affected, environmental problems and the solution to the issue of the wreck.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy that our disaster should lead to Community legislation moving forward, but I am also firmly convinced – and I hope to convince you – that Europe must have mechanisms for providing a European response, which does not yet exist, to these disasters, which are going to continue to occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some amendments are designed to water down the Commission’s wordings on the pretext of avoiding a witch hunt against the captains and crews. This is all very well, but why are the directives only aimed at the latter? Why not implicate the people who are really responsible, namely those who organise the shipments? Why not prevent them from causing harm by applying genuinely dissuasive sanctions, for, if ships are able to sail under flags of convenience and if determining who owns them is sometimes a real headache, the big companies that profit from these shipments, notably the oil corporations, are, for their part, perfectly identifiable. It is against these groups that the most severe measures should be taken in order to prevent the race for profits leading to collective tragedies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every party involved in marine transport must be made to accept responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, a system of criminal sanctions should be introduced, with heavy fines imposed, ships confined to harbour and sums demanded by way of guarantee. In France, the police port authority has recently set an example by imposing fines of EUR 250 000. Offending ships must be banned once and for all from EU ports in the event of repeat offences; joint Member State investigation teams must be strengthened, as permitted by the framework decision of 13 June 2002; and full use must be made of criminal investigations in the country in which the port is situated with a view to carrying out on-board inspections, hearing witnesses and taking samples. Cooperation must be strengthened between maritime police in detecting pollution and identifying the polluters; a European coastguard must be created in the long run; and Member States must be encouraged to transpose the European directives relating to safety at sea into their legislation, and must be penalised if they delay doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, eight Member States, a number of which are quick to give lessons in ecology, appear not to respect Community legislation on classification societies and port state control. Let us not forget that, if the Erika I package had been respected, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster could have been avoided. With the Motorway of the Sea project, the sea appears more than ever as an alternative to roads. For example, 350 000 lorries should embark each year at Montoire to travel to Spain. Strict, and strictly applied, maritime regulations are required, but they should be applied to everyone and not only to European ships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we are dealing with is a series of provisions that completes the picture of fruitful work, which includes the provision for double hull tankers to be on the black list of ships that are no longer sea-worthy, the call for Member States to provide a list of refuge ports: a raft of measures that have been taken during this parliamentary term and for which we must give credit to the Commission, but for which we must also claim our part.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, therefore, what compelled me and my group to fully support the Pex report, in particular, and I would like to highlight one of its amendments – which I have heard being challenged in parts but I believe that we should all appreciate how useful it is – on the call for a European coastguard to be set up as rapidly as possible. We cannot call for greater controls, we cannot expect sanctions to be enforced if we do not have the instruments to do so effectively. This would be a great step forwards, also for a whole range of other issues that we are faced with in the European Union, not least that of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we need to carry out a general review. On the issues of safety – aviation safety, as we heard just now, safety at sea, and I would add food safety – European public opinion is at times far ahead of governments; it calls for more Europe, for European regulations. We should feel encouraged by this feeling amongst the public and also call on the Council, which has to date been somewhat reticent on these issues, to not disappoint such important expectations, which, for our fellow citizens, have increased recently and which can really give us important results for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, like others I welcome these reports on combating ship-source pollution. The UK, as an island, is especially vulnerable, and the history of our coastline is littered with horrific accidents and disasters not dissimilar to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. I am sure there is merit in the idea of harmonising sanctions, but these need to be very powerful measures and certainly must not weaken Member States' existing legislation. Harmonising up, yes, but levelling down, no.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we need to ask who we are really trying to make responsible. Mr Andrews referred earlier on to 'rust buckets': the elderly ships on our seas that are a threat to coastlines, to maritime safety and to marine life. In the event of an accident, it is not the captains of these ships who need a custodial or prison sentence; it is the owners, those who are really responsible. All too often, it seems, it is those at the top, those with ultimate responsibility, who escape justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ortuondo Larrea and others referred to flags. This is something of a distraction. The real issue here is the farce whereby ships are allowed to sail under flags of a country with which they have no connection at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also need to ensure that the rights of people living near areas vulnerable to disasters are protected. We have to consider the consequences for citizens who live close to pollution disaster areas.</p>
<p class="contents">All these aspects vary from one country to another and, listening to this debate, I remain to be convinced as to how these harmonising instruments will actually crack down on those who are really responsible and bring them to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We Galicians are well aware of the problem, unfortunately, but I sincerely believe that we are moving in the right direction. The Commission has reacted quickly and correctly and we must once again congratulate the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, on her proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now our turn and, fundamentally, the turn of the Council. And I would like to stress the important step we are also taking on the issue of codecision, with the intention from the outset to agree common positions with the Council allowing us to speed up the very necessary entry into force of the legislative rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Council will accept our proposals, and I believe that Parliament must stand firm, as our fellow Members have said, in particular Mr Piecyk.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate our rapporteurs – Mr Pex, Mr Poignant and Mr Di Lello – on their efforts and their contributions to complementing and improving the Commission’s proposals in relation to these indispensable deterrent measures. The sea belongs to all of us, and whoever pollutes must pay the price, whether they do so intentionally or as a result of negligence, including criminal sanctions which could involve prison sentences. And the European Union must offer an example and lead this effective prosecution of offences against the marine environment at world level. We therefore also support measures, such as the preventive seizure of ships, aimed at guaranteeing compliance with the sanctions imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the proposal in Mr Pex’s report that there must be a common European coastguard service, charged with monitoring one hundred percent compliance with this international and European legislation. This does not imply that we want to replace the national services in the Member States. We are talking about an additional monitoring and coordination measure, as well as a genuine Community system for monitoring the maritime traffic in dangerous goods, by satellite, with black boxes, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which is key to maritime safety, as has been demonstrated, is controls of flags of convenience. We must promote and incentivise European flags, and I therefore also share the opinion in the report by Mr Poignant that European symbols should begin to be used on ships’ flags, as currently happens in the European Union in the case of vehicle registration plates.</p>
<p class="contents">With these two reports, the European Parliament is allying itself with the Commission and contributing to giving the European Union greater maritime safety and better environmental protection. All we need now, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is for the Council to approve them and for them to enter into force quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important to have legislation in place under which those responsible for unlawful oil or chemical discharges from ships can be prosecuted. We are no longer prepared to put up with reckless behaviour, which too often has resulted in irreparable damage to the environment. Nevertheless, it is necessary to differentiate between intentional and accidental pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom already has criminal sanctions in place for unlawful discharges from ships, as specified in the Marpol Convention, and matters relating to criminal law should, as such, fall within the competence of the Member State and not the Community. Furthermore, as there have been no practical difficulties between Member States in deciding where a prosecution should take place, this proposal should be removed from the framework decision. Finally on this point, the introduction of a European coastguard is neither practical nor necessary, nor is it consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. British Conservative MEPs will oppose those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Poignant Report, in principle we support this proposal and accept that the new regulation will improve cooperation between the administrators of maritime registers in the Member States. As I clearly pointed out prior to the vote in the debate of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, British Conservative MEPs will vehemently oppose the integration of the emblem of the European Union onto our Red Ensign. It will do nothing to enhance security and could even make EU-registered ships potential targets. In addition, identification is not an issue, as all vessels carry their unique IMO numbers as well as the name of their ports of registry.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, registration principles are determined internationally in the United Nations and IMO system, which is global rather than European. The EU is not a nation-state – fortunately – and it is doubtful whether anyone else would recognise an EU flag in terms of the international conventions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current proposal for a Council decision is based on the idea of tightening up civil and criminal responsibility for pollution-generating maritime transport. In line with the positions of the Commission directive and with the traditional positions of the European Parliament, the proposal has enabled the European Parliament to fine-tune the initial text with two unanimously approved amendments that I consider to be highly relevant. The first extends the scope of criminal responsibility to behaviour resulting in substantial harm to people, beyond the limited criterion of death or serious injury. The second, following a similar logic, extends the perpetrators’ responsibility from damage to species of fauna and flora to substantial damage to the protected natural environment, which is all marine and coastal life at risk from pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore pay tribute to the rapporteur Mr Di Lello Finuoli, who tabled these amendments. Indeed, the new legal framework on maritime pollution and the future Lisbon Maritime Surveillance Agency, established by the Brussels Council last month, leads us to believe that Europe is finally assuming its responsibilities. It would be absurd for Europe to be responsible for regulating sea resources, without first having the necessary means to protect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The maritime environment is also being contaminated by practices indifferent to the law and environmental welfare, such as emptying bilge water into the open sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Polluters of the environment must be made accountable for what they do. Strengthening the penal framework will hopefully act as an adequate deterrent to those who transport cargo which is dangerous for the environment in vessels in poor condition or unsuited to the purpose, or otherwise contaminate the environment though negligence or indifference. For example, in the Baltic Sea, which is a very fragile and shallow internal sea surrounded by quite a number of countries, enormous risks are taken which could prove to be environmentally disastrous. Oil is transported in single-hull vessels in difficult conditions in the winter when there is pressure from ice.</p>
<p class="contents">There also have to be more inspections and routine monitoring to bring illegal pollution under control. I hope that after the directives to improve safety at sea enter into force at EU level, all parties responsible for maritime transport will consider carefully how consignments can be handled using appropriate equipment and in a way that is as environmentally safe as possible. Apathy and the taking of unnecessary risks must be minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that EU legislation is to be strengthened and harmonised with regard to this issue.

Criminal sanctions should be used against those responsible for the environmental pollution caused by deliberate dumping and by maritime disasters. The consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster are still being felt in Spain, Portugal and France. It is high time that the international rules governing marine discharges were incorporated into EU legislation and, equally importantly, that such rules were enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I fundamentally disagree with Mrs Foster's and her colleagues' opposition to the idea of a European coastguard. I have been arguing for the creation of an EU coastguard for some time, and welcome Mr Pex's acknowledgement that such a body has an important role to play in implementing these rules by carrying out spot checks. It could also play a number of additional roles in EU waters, such as providing an adequate emergency response mechanism should an environmental disaster, such as the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, occur again.</p>
<p class="contents">If one considers the problems we have in EU waters, one can see the potential of an EU coastguard. For example, our waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings. Illegal human trafficking in the EU is now worth over EUR 4 billion annually. Drug trafficking remains a massive problem and the illegal trade in small arms, whose main recipients are terrorists and criminals, is estimated to account for 10% of the global trade in arms. Cigarette smuggling has almost replaced drug trafficking, due to the enormous profit margins that can be exploited without the same degree of risk in terms of penal sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue, in total contrast to what Mrs Foster says, that an EU coastguard could effectively police EU waters: it could clamp down on illegal dumping, enforce the common fisheries policy, assist with emergency rescue services and restrict illegal trafficking. I hope that the Commission will respond positively to Mr Pex's call for the creation of an EU coastguard, and that the Irish Presidency of the Council will also heed that call, particularly since, in coming from an island, it will appreciate the value of such a body policing our high seas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to explain straight away that appearing like this in Strasbourg does not mean I am taking sides in the debate on wearing the veil. I most certainly am not. I am simply trying to look after myself. Over the last four years I have come to this building some forty times. On more than twenty of those occasions I have left with a cold and feeling quite unwell, sometimes even running a temperature. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to urge those in charge of maintaining the building to take appropriate action. It seems to me that the building itself is rather unwell. It is certainly causing some of us who frequent it to become unwell. I assure you I do not suffer in this way anywhere else. Sudden drastic temperature changes should not be allowed. They are not good for one, nor are all the draughts around this building.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, I must express my gratitude to Mr Pex for his work. Basically, it supports the Commission’s position. In this connection, I should like to say that most of the amendments are aimed at clarifying the text of the proposal for a directive. They improve the text of the Directive. Consequently we accept them all, notably Amendments  1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20 and 23.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are acceptable in principle, but will need some redrafting. This is the case of Amendments  6 and 22 concerning the creation of a common European coastguard. The Commission was able to explain its views on the subject in the course of replies to questions in the House. We are favourably inclined towards the ideas. Nonetheless, the budgetary and operational implications of such an initiative will need to be studied first. In particular, it will be necessary to consider relations between this potential coastguard, the Maritime Safety Agency and the agency to be charged with managing external borders, as well as with the existing competent national structures. The latter may be modified in the future. The Commission will work with a will to deal with these complex issues. It has to be said, however, that this is not an easy task and will take some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, some amendments are unacceptable. We therefore reject them, either because they are redundant or because they are not in line with the objectives of our initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude on the report by Mr Pex, allow me to reiterate my conviction that there is considerable convergence. Parliament is once again supporting us with regard to strengthening maritime safety. I await the outcome of tomorrow’s vote with great interest. I trust that at the earliest opportunity the House will adopt this report and this position at first reading. That should promote debate with the Council, where things are much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Parliament for debating this report alongside that of Mr Di Lello and the framework decision. I should like to thank Mr Di Lello too for his work and for his support for the Commission’s proposals. I should also like to thank him for his determination to carry on fighting the curse of ship-source pollution. Parliament and the Commission are of one mind on this. We are particularly concerned about intentional discharge. As I stated in our text, intentional discharge accounts for over 50% of the pollution of European Union waters. It is therefore a crucial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the first amendment as it stands. This is because of its non-legal nature. Nonetheless, we would like to emphasise that we are appreciative of the support we have again received for our position regarding the Community’s competence to include the principle of criminal sanctions in the implementation of Community policy. We are conscious of Parliament’s support in connection with the appeal brought by the Commission against the framework decision on protection of the environment under the Criminal Code.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust it will prove possible to adopt both these texts. I also hope the Council will find a way of being more accommodating, or that it will at least prevail on certain Member States to moderate their position. After all, other Member States of the Union fully support the stance adopted by Parliament and the Commission. All these issues would complete the global framework of stepping up maritime safety and combating pollution caused by discharges. I have in mind European waters, coastlines and exclusive economic zones. This is the crux of our policy. As such, it calls for special attention.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to statements made by some honourable Members, I should like to make it clear that the Commission will continue to work to see the legislative proposals through. We shall not hesitate to act if countries fail to meet the deadlines for transposing into their national legislation the directives adopted here with a view to combating marine pollution and promoting maritime safety. We are quite prepared to go to the courts to insist on implementation by the Member States of the Union. Port facilities designed to deal with discharges are part of this drive. Such facilities are absolutely essential for the implementation of these texts. I very much hope the House will endorse the latter tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other issue before us today, namely the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers in the Community, I should like to thank Mr Poignant for his work. I must also thank him for the discussions and contacts with the Council. I very much hope they will facilitate the adoption of this regulation at first reading, assuming the House endorses the rapporteur’s report and the amendments he supports. Early adoption is essential, given the imminence of enlargement. This particular enlargement will have major implications for the maritime sector. Mr President, it is important to develop existing legislation and to supplement and update it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has accepted most of the amendments, and I should like to thank Mr Poignant once again. The Commission can accept Amendment No 3. Nonetheless, we have to reject Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on displaying the Union’s emblem in a corner of the flags flown by vessels registered in Member States of the Union, as it would hinder agreement with the Council at first reading. Furthermore, this is not the appropriate legal instrument with which to introduce such a measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
