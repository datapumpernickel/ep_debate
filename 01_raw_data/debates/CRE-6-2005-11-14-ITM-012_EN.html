<p class="contents">I believe that one of these comments, which he made during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the EU Member States held in Luxembourg on 18 October 2005, had a particularly ominous ring to it. Amongst other things, Commissioner Mandelson said at this meeting that the European Union must make concessions to other countries during the WTO negotiations, since on balance the European Union would gain more from exporting industrial goods than it would lose from reducing protection for agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">What this may mean is that the Commissioner wishes to sacrifice the interests of EU agriculture during the December summit in Hong Kong, in favour of nebulous gains in other fields. I believe that the Commissioner has clearly overstepped his authority with this comment. If his ideas were put into practice, around 1.2 million jobs could be lost in the EU in the agricultural and related sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on the President of the European Parliament to bring these concerns to the attention of Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This workplace accident took place in the South of Spain, during the construction of a flyover of the Mediterranean motorway. In Portugal, in my region of Oporto district, this tragedy was felt very deeply. It has left families without their father, husband or son, the man who guaranteed a livelihood for the family at a time of high unemployment in Northern Portugal. I should therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to ensure that expressions of sympathy and solidarity with the families are backed by suitable financial support.

We obviously do not have the same view on the events taking place in France, but the extraordinary thing is that it is not possible to talk about them in this Parliament. If these events were taking place in Latin America, Africa or Asia, resolutions would be drafted in their regard. Since these events began, 9 000 fires have been started intentionally: buses and bus depots, schools, crèches, nursery schools, libraries, sports centres, youth clubs, health centres, social centres and even churches are all being set alight. Police officers are being attacked, but so too are the fire fighters who risk their lives, bus drivers, underground train drivers, not to mention the two innocent lives that have been lost, respectable French citizens who were lynched in front of their families. Meanwhile, the European Parliament is refusing to let us talk about the matter.</p>

There is a legislative vacuum, in my country at least, and material can circulate freely on the Internet from one person to another.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, twenty people were arrested for trading in hard core paedophilic material – children of two, four, five and six years old, bestiality and such abject things – and not one of them was named. They were not allowed to be named on television. We protect them under the banner of individual rights. What individual rights can a person have who commits sodomy on a child of three or four or five?</p>

<p class="contents">Poland is a leading producer of meat, in particular pork, and it is experiencing major problems in terms of grain surpluses. The Russian market is extremely large, and its loss will place many farms at risk of bankruptcy. Since Poland joined the European Union, Polish farmers have endured almost nothing but losses. It is no longer so profitable for them to grow crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, potatoes and industrial crops, and they have been told they will have to reduce the acreage under cultivation and the price of sugar beet.</p>
<p class="contents">Polish farmers have put up with a great deal, but they are no longer in a position to put up with delays or injustice on the part of the EU where the Russian blockade is concerned. The fundamental question that must be asked at this point is whether the EU is intended to benefit everyone, or only a chosen few. If the former is the case, then I would like to ask what measures will be taken to protect Polish agriculture, which is an integral part of the agricultural market in the EU as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">Should Poland and Slovakia, or the other new EU Member States, organise riots on a similar scale in order to ensure that they receive comparable funding for job creation?

This will lead to a 19% drop in electricity production for the Slovak economy which will affect other sectors of the economy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">To help Slovakia in coping with this demanding task, the European Union promised to provide adequate financial assistance. For the 2007-2013 budget period, the Commission proposed a contribution of EUR 237 million. Decommissioning costs were calculated on the basis of data from 2000, according to which the actual costs were expected to reach EUR 750 million. The EUR 237 million proposed by the Commission, in addition to the EUR 180 million that has already been paid, represents less than one third of the actual costs.</p>
