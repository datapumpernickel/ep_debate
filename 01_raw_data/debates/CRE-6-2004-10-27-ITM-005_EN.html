<p class="contents">I listened very attentively to yesterday's debate. I have had extensive contacts with the Group leaders, and I have also spoken with the President–in–Office of the Council. I have come to the conclusion that if a vote were to take place today, the outcome would not be positive for the European institutions or for the European project.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances I have decided not to submit a new Commission for your approval today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud and sustained applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I need more time to look at this issue, to consult with the Council and to consult further with you, so that we can have strong support for the new Commission. It is better to have more time to get it right.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">These last few days have demonstrated that the European Union is a strong political construction and that this Parliament, elected by popular vote across all our Member States, has a vital role to play in the governance of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I was honoured to receive your support as President-designate of the Commission in July. At that time I committed myself to working actively with you in the European interest. I renew that commitment today. I believe that we can agree on our common commitment to reinforcing the democratic nature of European integration. In that spirit, I hope we can arrive at an outcome in the next few weeks that will permit us to take forward our work in the European Union. You can count on me. I can always offer you loyal, constructive cooperation for the good of Europe and the European Union project.</p>

<p class="contents">We remain in politically uncharted territory, since this is a situation we could never have foreseen. The Treaties clearly lay down that the new Commission must commence its duties on 1 November and that beforehand the European Parliament must give its opinion on a proposal. But Parliament clearly cannot give its opinion if there is no proposal. Mr Barroso tells us that there is no proposal. I believe it would be good to know the Council’s position, since, if there is no proposal, the Council must also give its opinion.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">is a strong European Commission. The President of the Commission has said that he has no proposal to make today, and that he needs more time. Mr President of the Commission, let me tell you, on behalf of our Group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that our support for you has never wavered over the past few weeks, and you can be sure that we will continue to support you in the difficult days and weeks now, so that there will eventually be a strong Commission under your decisive leadership.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today’s applause showed that your proposal enjoys wide support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We would have preferred to see a vote in favour of your team today – that I will not deny – but politics is a process. I hope that it is apparent to all in the European Union that this House possesses influence and power, and the European Union is undergoing a process of parliamentarisation. Today is for that reason a significant day in the history of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our group has always had the strategic objective of having a strong Commission presided over by you, and of not isolating one single member of your team. Instead, we must take note of the overall results of the hearings and draw conclusions from them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It will be your task to join, on this basis, with all interested parties and with the Council in coming to the right decisions. We also, in order that you may not be the tool of governments, must see to it that the future President of the Commission can have the last word and reject candidates put forward to him. This leads our group to believe that we do not need a decision today. It is now for us in this House to discharge our responsibilities. In difficult times, when, on Friday, the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, with us affirming our belief in our continent’s future, we want a strong European Parliament, a strong Commission and a Council of Ministers that works well with both institutions. Believing as we do that Europe has a future, we now wish you, Mr President-designate of the European Commission, much success in presenting your team, to which we hope we will be able to give a great deal of support and a vote of approval. You have our support as we go this way together.</p>

We have had lively discussions and vigorous disagreements over the last few weeks. My group’s resolution, taken unanimously yesterday evening, was preceded by hard, tough debates and serious disagreements, even in our own ranks. We had disagreements because our decision would involve passing judgment on our Social Democrat friends in the Commission. After lengthy discussions yesterday evening, which involved them – and let me tell them that they were the outstanding members of the proposed Commission – our solidarity with these friends from our group meant that the decision was not, for us, an easy one. The decision we took yesterday evening is that we, despite everything, cannot have confidence in the Commission that you, Mr Barroso, would have proposed, or intended to propose, this morning. Rather than revisit the debate, which was a lively one, I want to tell you that, having recognised – this morning, yesterday evening and during the course of yesterday – that this proposal would not gain a majority, you came to the right conclusion by acceding to Parliament’s wishes. On behalf of my group, let me say that this was the right course of action. What you are doing this morning opens up the way to a shared future for all of us, both the Commission and the broad majority in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear Mr Poettering say that he supported this development, and I can tell him that it is never too late to join those who said that the European Parliament also needs to be strengthened when debates are cut short, when they are reduced to a presentation, on the basis that the European Parliament talks sense only when it agrees with the Commission. So, welcome to the club, Mr Poettering. Those who want a strong Commission, enabled to work by the broad support for it in the European Parliament, are those who want one strong institution – the Commission – supported by another strong institution – Parliament – to be capable of dealing with the real challenges of the years to come. If you strengthen such a Commission, then you are for Europe. If you seek to make it dependent on the votes of that gentleman, whose three or four votes just might help the Commission get a majority, then you are weakening Europe. That is why a broad majority is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the last few weeks, Mr Barroso, we have had various proposals to put to you. My group expects you, in your future considerations, to bear in mind the proposals that this House put to you at the end of the hearings. Speaking on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we also expect your considerations to be influenced by what the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has told you, for one thing is clear, and that is that you will need my group’s support for your future Commission too. While offering you cooperation, we also urge you to take seriously the advice that the Socialist Group in this House has given you. On 22 July, you had 413 votes, some of them from members of my group. Many in my group did not vote for you on that occasion, but what you got then was a great vote of confidence. Over the last three months, you have been gambling with some of your credit, but, with your decision today, you have won some of it back. We in the European Parliament’s Socialist Group are ready for constructive collaboration, and that is the road you have chosen today – something we have sometimes missed over the last few weeks. If we are to achieve something in the next few weeks, I ask you not to bring back the same Commission that you would have presented to us today, as otherwise we could have voted on it today. I ask you to bring us a new proposal, one offering the possibility of broader support for the Commission.</p>

Its will was tested, its will has prevailed. At no time did we ask for anything more than is our right. We asked for no prerogative that is not laid down in the law of Europe. We asked for our considered judgment to be treated with respect. At every stage, our willingness to stand by that judgment was doubted, mistrusted and tested. It was tested to the edge of political crisis until the price of exerting our will became so high that only the unwalked ground of political crisis stretched ahead of us, and none of us wanted to venture onto it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our will and our willingness to stand by our judgment prevailed. Nobody in this Chamber seeks confrontation for its own sake. We value the tension that exists between our institutions, because the ability to turn that tension to mutual benefit is the sign of our institutions' maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you suggested yesterday that it was anti–European to vote against your Commission. I do not honestly think you believe that. You know that when pro–Europeans criticise your Commission, they are not doing the work of Euroscepticism, but the very opposite: today, Euroscepticism loses because the voice of democracy in Europe has risen by an octave and has made itself heard in every national capital and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You know that Liberals and Democrats in this House challenged you and your Commission, because we want it to be stronger than you were given the chance to build it – stronger so that the European Union is stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I restate now that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports you. We voted for you in the knowledge that your commitment to the European Union matches our own. I say again today what I said yesterday: if our House is weak, then so is yours, because if the governments of Europe do not respect us, they will not respect you or the independence of your College. Our strength is your strength.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You have a chance to rebuild a Commission that can win the support of this House. Work fast! You know the will of this Chamber. Through resignation, reshuffle or withdrawal, you can come back to us with a new Commission, confident that we hold you in high regard as a committed European and a President of the European Commission with a capacity for great work.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I spoke of an elephant in this Chamber, and it is here again. Once again I call on the Council to reflect on the rights of this House and on the way in which it chooses to exercise them. Liberals and Democrats call on the Council to respect the prerogatives of this House and the independence of the Commission, which it is charged with approving. We call on you to reflect on your own responsibility for the impasse at which we found ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will work with you to surmount that impasse. Over the rich summit dinner on Friday, let there be food for thought.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, on behalf of my Group, I commit the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to working with you to see a Commission approved in November. I thank you for your candour and commitment. I repeat that this House has today grown in stature: our will was tested and our will has prevailed.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, over the last few days we in this House have seen exciting things happening. I think that all of us have learned things. We have learned that getting to grips with the political substance of a Commission is quite a business. We learned that from your election, Mr Barroso, when you gained a majority, so that you are the intended future President of the Commission. We then had to discuss the competence of the proposed Commissioners. When you introduced yourself to us, you told us that you were independent, that you wanted to be independent, no matter what was said by Mr Schroeder, Mr Blair or anyone else, that the Commission would be your work rather than the Council’s.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is why we are telling you, in plain language, to read very carefully the resolution that this House proposed, the one that effectively led to your withdrawal. That resolution contains the arguments on the basis of which we will judge the next proposals. It is competence and conflicts of interest that are at issue. Do not come back here proposing tainted people as Commissioners, or you will end up with your back to the wall again. Do not propose people who go against what your Commission has it in mind to do. We will therefore be quite frank in saying that we regard your withdrawal as a brave step, as a sign that you have seen sense. You have realised that there is no possibility of winning a majority with only one part of this House behind you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a victory for European democracy and a great encouragement to all those who helped create the conditions for this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that when, under the pretext that it was criticising his team, the President-designate accused half of this House of siding with, and I quote, ‘the anti-European extremists’, he yesterday revealed himself once more to be precisely the person he not long ago maintained he did not want to be: a President of the Right in conflict with the Left and, indeed, the liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not believe that we could agree upon a common position, but we succeeded and we won. Now, the next stage has to be prepared and, with that in view, lessons learned from what has just happened. How did such an unprecedented situation arise? Yesterday, I drew attention to the disaffection felt by the majority of people and to some of the symptoms of the evil that is eating away at our institutions. In this context, the challenge to be taken up by European leaders at all levels was, and remains, that of daring to carry out a critical evaluation of what is now lacking and of showing that they are determined to invest the European adventure with meaning again, for, contrary to what you said, Mr Barroso, I, for my part, believe in Europe. I am convinced of the need for Europe, so do not go on classifying me among the anti-Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso did the opposite of taking up this challenge. Not only did he accentuate the most controversial features of European economic and social policy by placing champions of liberalism in strategic posts, but he also fuelled fears of a return to the moral and patriarchal order of times gone by and of people uniting behind a vision of the world closer to that of American neo-conservatives than to the expectations of Europeans. That is what, in our view, must change in the future Commission, not just the identity of the person responsible for a particular portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">In this troubled context, I shall single out one very good piece of news. Others have said it before me: what we have here are fresh stirrings of political confrontation in the European Parliament, finally replacing half-heartedness and feeble consensus. A real debate about the civilised order has begun that may have far-reaching consequences for the greater good of Europe. In this sense, these historic moments constitute a genuine milestone. May their promise be fulfilled!</p>

Nor will they work where the Constitution is concerned. The prime ministers appoint people they want or, often, people they want to get rid of, and expect us to rubber-stamp their choice. We propose instead that each individual national parliament choose its own Commissioner and hold him or her responsible. In that way, we should have a democratically appointed Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the body we now call the Commission? It is the engine of integration. It is not subject to control by elected representatives, be they national representatives from the parliaments or supranational representatives from this House. It operates through 30 000 officials and more than 3 000 working groups, through which the Commission secures influence for itself, and through a network in the Member States that also bypasses the national authorities. The working groups are secret and cannot be controlled by the national parliaments’ Europe committees. The thousands of decisions and laws adopted by the Commission are rarely made in the Commission itself but, more often than not, in working groups involving participants of whom we have no knowledge. Only relatively few votes are taken in the Commission, and the general public is unaware of the results. The Commission administers a budget of EUR 100 billion, but this is not controlled by the Commission’s own accounts department, by the Court of Auditors or by the Committee on Budgetary Control set up for the purpose by the European Parliament. Nor, for safety’s sake, can the Ombudsman obtain any documents he might request.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission itself, the presidents cannot control the various Directors General, even though it is formally the president who is responsible for doing so. The whole lot of them are, however, in agreement as to the direction to be taken, namely ever more power to Brussels. Every opportunity must be taken to obtain more power, and concessions to transparency are made only rarely. It took Mr Santer four years to have the Commission’s telephone directory made publicly available. It is now on the Net as an experiment. It has taken Mr Prodi four years to have the Commission’s agendas and minutes put on the Net. It took Mr Barroso a day to make the list of Commission working groups available. That was the day before he was to be elected here in this House. He wanted in that way to show that it was he who made the decisions, but then transparency came to an end. We have not been given a promise that we shall be told who participates in the working groups and what they do.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is not taking part in the onslaught on an individual Commissioner’s personal beliefs. Nor, however, will we deliver votes to a supranational, anti-democratic organisation which one departing Commissioner described very precisely as a ‘monster’. This ‘monster’ has a monopoly on tabling bills. No one can blame the European Parliament for using its limited powers to reject the Commission, but the undignified hounding of an individual Commissioner shows that the best form of control is obtained if each country’s electorate and own national parliament chooses its own Commissioner and holds him or her responsible. In that way, the Commission would be elected from the bottom up and not from the top down by a qualified majority of prime ministers. The individual Commissioners could attend their national parliaments each week and listen to, and talk with, the representatives of the electorate, and the Commission would then constitute our representatives in Brussels, and the officials its servants. The Commission would no longer be an unruly ‘monster’, and people would stand up and applaud spontaneously if the Commission President were to pass by. There is a long way still to go, and Mr Barroso has not shown that he dares take the leap of becoming the voters’ servant. Today, he has talked with the representatives of the three largest groups. The four smallest groups have not been consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before making any decision, Martin Luther King used to ask himself: ‘Is it right?’ I believe it is right that every political person should stand up for his or her own convictions and fight to defend the ideas of others for the sake of the common good. Politics, in fact, is about making laws in the overall interests of today’s and tomorrow’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who do not express their reasoned opinions are acting in the interests of their parties but not in the interests of Parliament, which represents all voters and not just those who voted for us personally. We should therefore have preferred to vote today so as to carry out our mutual responsibilities. Nevertheless, we accept Mr Barroso’s decision in the hope that further time for calm reflection will provide an opportunity for the Council, which is due to meet in Rome shortly for the signing of the Constitutional Treaty, to reach a considered understanding with Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We renew our trust in Mr Barroso in the certainty that his choices and the appointments made by the governments will comply with the people’s call for a transparent Commission that respects the principle of subsidiarity and is able to uphold everyone’s rights, within the context of the overall interests of society from a European viewpoint, but also in the interests of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on Parliament, in any case, to provide all the committees with specific rules in common, so that future hearings will all follow the same procedures. The different procedures used to date have not, in fact, guaranteed either impartial methods or respect for true democracy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In response to the statement by the Council representative, we do not consider that the Prodi Commission can remain in office for as long as necessary. The Prodi Commission must remain in office for ordinary administration until the next plenary part-session of Parliament in Strasbourg. On that date, Mr Barroso must come before this House again with the complete list of Commissioners. Otherwise we would have a poor image of this Europe, which I do not think anybody wants.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past fifteen years in this House, I have always remembered that the secular spirit of Parliament can only be preserved so long as this secularity is not transformed into a new kind of fundamentalism, which, while supporting the protection of some groups, breaches the rights of others. Two wrongs never make a right but create new oppressions and divisions in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who tries to protect differences in culture or sexual orientation by discriminating against the culture or religious beliefs of others is not acting for the common good but perpetrating new discrimination. Intellectual narrow-mindedness makes human beings petty and arrogant. Respect for others, on the other hand, enables them to formulate rules that ensure peaceful coexistence for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the Commission must listen to Parliament but reject the attempts by some to blackmail you. The Commission does not need guardians along its way, but loyal and intellectually honest partners in dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this anecdote were to be translated, taken seriously, and adapted for the European Parliament, Mr Barroso would have a successful career ahead of him in America, and many outstanding politicians and speakers in this House would triumph over the political scene in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Barroso’s critics, I should like to remind them that it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the appointment of Commissioners. Mr Barroso’s room for manoeuvre is limited, and we should be clear about the fact that it will remain limited until there is a change in the way the Commission is appointed. If this House wishes to say that the governments of the Member States play too large a role in this process, it should say so clearly. I do not share this opinion, however, as I do not believe the role governments play is too large. If the Commission is to have the support of the Member States, the Member States’ governments must have a major part to play in its appointment, even if this sometimes prolongs the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have great respect for all those speakers who have expressed their reservations concerning individual Commissioners-designate, as many of us also had doubts about a number of them. The voting procedure is what it is, however, and we vote on the Commission as a whole, without being able to vote on individual Commissioners, something that has both positive and negative sides. The ball is now back in the court of the President of the Commission and the EU Member States, but this decision-making process should not be allowed to drag on, as Europe needs a new Commission, just as Europe needs a strong European Parliament. Indeed this House is now proving its strength, and I am sure we are all aware of this, both those who would vote in favour of Mr Barroso and his Commission and those who would vote against. It is to be hoped that the heated dispute we are witnessing and involved in will not cause a permanent rift in this House. Even when we have fundamental differences of opinion, we should remember the aspects that unite us and not only those that may divide us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my respect for Mr Barroso. You do not have an easy life, and you have embarked upon a difficult mission. This makes it even more important for me to tell you, at this difficult time, that I value your efforts and the strength of character you have demonstrated. I believe that before long we will be able to congratulate you on your political success. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strictly speaking, the presidency and the Council are not official parties to the discussion that is taking place between Parliament and the new President of the Commission. We are naturally very closely involved in this debate and this situation. I can also respond to Mr Watson’s remark by assuring you that we have, literally, missed not one word of anything that the Members of this House have had to say about this important issue, as I already explained this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Council bears a share of responsibility in this situation. As Mr Barroso has already indicated, we will take that responsibility by consulting the new President of the Commission and the other Members of the European Council at the earliest opportunity, in a bid to bring about a speedy solution to this situation. I should like to repeat what I stated this morning, namely that the European Parliament has, of course, got every right to take its responsibility, determine its position and make its choice. I also said that the present confrontation between Parliament and the incoming Commission can also be seen as evidence of a European democracy that is reaching maturity, and that I naturally have every confidence that the position that your House will adopt will be well thought-out. I expressly repeated this morning that the presidency and the Council had every confidence in Mr Barroso as the incoming President of the Commission, and that is still the case. I also expressed my sympathy and understanding for the step that he has just taken.</p>
<p class="contents">So, finally, I trust that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible. To that I would add that your work, the work of the Council and the presidency, as well as the work of the Commission, carries on as before. It is thus important to know that the present Prodi Commission will be carrying on its duties, so that the European citizen does not lose out as a result of this situation. The work will be continued at all levels and in all institutions, and the Prodi Commission will for that reason continue to carry out its tasks as long as this proves to be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that everything has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">I want first of all to thank all those who supported me and understood my approach. I hope to be able to work with you over the next five years. I think it may be said that we shall get to know each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen for you to know that I am a man of compromise. Compromise is something in which I profoundly believe. You should know that I am in favour of a ‘coalition’, if I can put it like that, between all those who are in favour of the European project. This point is important. I already mentioned it at the meeting of the chairmen of political groups when the issue of politicisation came up. Admittedly, I belong to a political family. I have the great honour of belonging to the political family of Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Alcide De Gasperi. I also believe, however, that we must unite all those who wish to work together, be they from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe or other groups who are in favour of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I want you to know that my Commission is not partisan. It is a Commission in which there are Christian Democrats and members of the European People’s Party and in which there are socialists and liberals and, too, a member of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. It is a pluralist Commission. The real Europe is characterised by pluralism, tolerance and balance and by a consensus designed to benefit our people.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore did what I had to do. I came here with my team and made a rational assessment of what was best, not only for the Commission but for all the European institutions. That, moreover, is an aspect I am keen to emphasise. As is natural in political debate – and I too am a politician – people do indeed sometimes say: it is we who have won, and the others have lost. I do not think of institutional relations within the European Union in terms of a victory by Parliament over the Council or of a victory of the Commission over Parliament. I do not think of our relations in those terms. It is not a football match. I believe that, on the contrary, we are sources of mutual strength. As has been said, and very commendably, we need a strong Parliament and a strong Commission too. That much is obvious. Our authority cannot be established at the expense of the other institutions. In this connection, I also want to give prominence to the Council, because the Council is the representative of the Member States, and I believe that all those who have been elected by the citizens of the Member States are democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, we must respect all our institutions, and that is indeed the way I intend to continue if, of course, I have your backing and support. We need this culture of respect between the various institutions in order to strengthen all those in Europe who are in favour of the idea of compromise. I do not believe there is any mileage in imagining that what the one institution gains, the other loses.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I believe that we have made broader and more fruitful cooperation possible. Ladies and gentlemen, we have not talked very much about Europe’s basic problems, but we need broader support in order to make progress towards achieving our priorities in Europe. For my part, I am, of course, prepared to work with you in a spirit of mutual respect and loyalty, with the European project – that of our citizens – always our main priority.</p>

Having listened to you, the Council and the Chairmen of the political groups, the Presidency would draw the following conclusions from what has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a request to delay the vote. If that were the case, Parliament would give its opinion on whether or not to accept this request. But that is not the case. We are not being asked to delay the vote. We are being told that there is not yet any proposal on which to vote. Mr Barroso needs more time to draw it up and the Council understands this and accepts it, and the Prodi Commission will therefore remain in office until we can debate and vote on a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, therefore, nothing to vote on at the moment. Neither does it make much sense to vote on motions for resolutions related to the debate on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are not going to vote on the motions for resolutions, I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to read them carefully.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe you will find elements in them which may help you in the work you have yet to do.</p>
<p class="contents">There will not, therefore, be a vote on any issue.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protests)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When I say that I invite Mr Barroso to read them, I also invite him to read all of the proposals presented by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to invite Mr Barroso and the Council to present us with a proposal as soon as possible, without setting any strict time limit, which Parliament can decide upon, and to keep us informed of how their work is progressing in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are no comments, the sitting is suspended.</p>
