The Beijing Conference was extremely important in terms of recognising women’s rights and approving an Action Platform endorsed by 189 countries. It established the content of these rights and approved instruments allowing these rights to be gradually consolidated. As usually happens with this type of international instrument, it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed.</p>
<p class="contents">This assessment was carried out over many sessions with preparatory meetings initially being held within a PropCom. These sessions made slow and sometimes difficult progress in terms of agreeing on certain aspects on which one group of countries, particularly those which are usually regarded as the most developed, considered that progress should be made. There were also some problems in terms of resistance to the language used, not in the political declaration which was approved earlier, but in the final document which was composed of four parts. One of these parts concerned the measures and policies to be approved by governments in order to consolidate not only the Beijing Platform but also everything which has been achieved by the various countries in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">This process was relatively complex as alliances were established between certain countries, particularly from the European Union, and the South American countries with the result that the G77 broke up at a certain point. This prevented the work from being carried out at a quicker pace.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, to summarise as quickly as possible, important progress was made in recognising women’s rights as human rights. Very positive political statements were made in terms of rejecting any violations of these human rights, eradicating all practices which violate human rights, referring to the Commission on the Status of Women and the optional protocol and combating racism and violence based on racial grounds. On the issue of violence against women, the satisfactory progress made included the agreement achieved on combating trafficking through international cooperation, with support for actions which are being developed at other levels in the international arena, and also the acceptance by all countries of public campaigns against violence based on the campaign instigated by the European Union on zero tolerance. Also discussed were the issues of poverty eradication policies, work as a factor in ensuring the economic participation of women, the essential need to adopt policies reconciling family and professional life and the need to develop access for women to education and training as a basic instrument in guaranteeing them independence. There was also, for the first time, a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity, usually associated with the male role, and the need for job-sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">On health, the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health. Special references were introduced, also on the EU’s initiative, to handicapped migrant women, elderly women and native women. The role of men was adequately emphasised, as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies. Also addressed was the introduction of an issue which was one of the fundamental instruments in the Beijing Platform, namely mainstreaming from the gender perspective. This must be included in all mechanisms on human rights, in the UN Treaties and at the Millennium Summit and represents an extremely important achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the methodologies for assessing the progress made by countries in applying their commitments, positive references were also made to measurable and well-established objectives resulting in the type of monitoring which allows a more objective balance to be produced, at any time, than that achieved to date. Discussions were also held on reinforcing the role of non-governmental organisations in conducting all the policies and as privileged partners of the State in ensuring that the Platform is implemented. The basic problems concerned what the European Union has already included in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the difficulty which some countries had in accepting the issue of sexual rights and its inherent diversity and the issue of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, and continuing the strategy defined at EU level of considering that this special conference was not a new conference but an intermediate phase, it was considered that, on these more delicate aspects, the language of Beijing should be used again. The EU took the decision to make a final declaration in which it reaffirmed the progress achieved and its intention to continue fighting to ensure that what for us is already a commitment, given the very constitution of the European Union and specifically Article 13, can be enshrined in future instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to apologise for the fact that my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, is unable to be here this afternoon. As some of you will know, she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate. As honourable Members will also know, she is coming to the committee next week in order to have a full exchange with Members, many of whom will, of course, have shared in the success achieved last week. Members will be able to follow up any further details in that exchange with Commissioner Diamantopoulou next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission, by thanking the Portuguese presidency for coordinating the Member States' positions so effectively and for handling the negotiations with other delegations so proficiently under what I understand were occasionally extremely difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also thank Parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session. Members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities made an extremely valuable contribution as part of the delegation. However, beyond that, they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the Member States and from associated countries. That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission also very much welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution: it is a firm, constructive statement of Parliament's commitment to gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at New York. Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing. If we succeeded, it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions. And succeed, I think we can say, we certainly did! In a number of areas the outcome document goes far beyond what was achieved five years ago at Beijing – a conference which I remember observing from slightly closer than would have been the case today. We managed that without having to concede any watering down of the Beijing Platform in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The document reaffirms women's rights as <span class="italic">human</span> rights. It urges all UN members to sign the CEDAW optional protocol and calls for a strong awareness of gender issues in the workings of the International Criminal Court. It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds. While we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the EC Treaty, the presidency made the European Union position clear in a final statement before the General Assembly. We have new, much clearer language on the state's duty to end violence against women, including domestic violence, and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity. If women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty. It seems to me, with some responsibilities in this field, inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart.</p>
<p class="contents">The document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women. It also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women, including work in the home, and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments. It also has something to say on methodology – how, in other words, to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice. At the European Union's insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators. Lastly, we welcome the reference to men's role in bringing about greater gender equality for they clearly have a considerable responsibility as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is better equipped than ever to deliver on its Beijing commitments with its stronger stand on human rights, gender equality and discrimination. The Amsterdam Treaty gives the Union increased scope to push ahead with implementation of the Beijing platform for action. I hope nobody will doubt the Commission's determination to do precisely that. The effort is of course led by my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but it is an endeavour in which all of us as Commissioners wish to be fully involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conference has shown that, over the past couple of years, we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas. For example, women are taking part in peace talks, improvement has been made in the field of women’s health problems, employment for women has improved in a number of countries and violence towards women has been put on the agenda in a number of countries. As such, we can trace the progress that has been made, although new problems have emerged in the meantime, of course. </p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of the problem of AIDS in women. In some African towns and cities, up to 40% of pregnant women suffer from AIDS. There is also the problem of trafficking in women, rape of women during armed conflicts, etc. Consequently, Beijing +5 could not afford to just focus on the progress that was made in respect of decisions taken at Beijing. Beijing +5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text, which it did, after a hard fight. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we have three tasks within the European Union. Firstly, as a European Union, we should remain the driving force behind the Member States. We played this role very distinctly in the past and we must continue to do so in future. It will be evident from the Fifth Action Programme and the financial resources used for this purpose whether the European Commission is serious about applying the Beijing Platform in years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not only vis-à-vis our own Member States that we have a role to play, we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries, those which we as MEPs have brought together in New York. We have proposed to continue the cooperation with them and asked the Commission, during the screening activities it carries out in the context of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, to assess the achievements with regard to the Beijing Platform too. </p>
<p class="contents">We also have a role to play vis-à-vis third countries. It is dreadful to have to listen to the problems which women face in third countries: genital mutilation, killing if they have been unfaithful or if they had sexual relations before marriage and all these kinds of problems. It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women. In my opinion, the aid which the European Union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make it clear that I am a Catholic, but an open-minded Catholic. I was greatly shocked by the news that the Church which I belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society. It was shocking, mainly because my Church offers so few opportunities to women within its own structures.</p>

They were tough negotiations, which is why the Portuguese Presidency deserves special thanks for speaking not only on behalf of the 15 Member States, but also on behalf of the associated countries, with the exception of Poland, as do the Commission and the Commissioner and her negotiators, who worked together with the Parliament delegation in an exemplary manner. That is most unusual, so here too special thanks. And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union. Our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas.</p>
<p class="contents">At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York. As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that.</p>
<p class="contents">But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women’s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned. We now have specific measures in place in many countries to combat the cruel practice of genital mutilation, the issue of HIV/AIDS was addressed and the role of women in the peace process, ignored hitherto, was recognised as an issue. The fight against violence was put on every country’s agenda. Access to capital, the role of men – very important, we would like to see more men taking part in the process – still need to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">We tabled our document, our report, in New York as an official UN document, another major success. I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union, Parliament’s progress, are now accessible to every country. We were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform.</p>
<p class="contents">We came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women’s rights. We want to have a parliamentarians’ conference in two years to review Beijing. We insist on another world women’s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues. We must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming, equal opportunities for men and women, stars on the world political agenda. It is in our interest to fight for this. I think, and this is my personal opinion, that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in Eastern Europe.</p>

In my opinion, all credit for this follow-on from Beijing +5, where the implementation of the action plans was discussed, should go to the NGOs, but also to the European Parliament, which was represented by five strong women, and naturally the European Commission, which, in the form of Mrs Diamontopoulou, was 100% committed to this conference. Progress has been made, that is for sure, as has already been mentioned by previous speakers. The distribution in care, actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me. I am pleased that the participating countries still subscribe to the Beijing Declaration and the action plan. It is nonetheless unfortunate that only eight countries in the world have managed to meet the essential obligations which follow on from these with regard to equality in education, paid work and a minimum representation of 30% in national parliaments. It naturally gives me pleasure to be able to say that the Netherlands is one of them, although I am not entirely satisfied with its emancipation policy, or rather, the lack of it, and that Germany, the Scandinavian countries and South Africa too belong to the eight.</p>
<p class="contents">But back to Europe. In my opinion, it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education. This development merits particular attention from us in the European Parliament. Not only is education the best way to obtain gender equality, it is also the quickest way and the only way if we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren will not still be grappling with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation. The other point I wanted to raise is the opposition from the Islamic and Asian countries with regard to women’s rights, in connection with which they refer to the sharia. I find it downright disgraceful that we women cannot join forces across the world. I would ask you to give attention to this. It is not just the Islamic and Asian countries to which this applies, but also Poland, for example. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask you, as I do not have any hard facts at my disposal regarding the acceding countries, whether it would be possible to analyse the status quo in the candidate countries, ideally as soon as possible so that we can assess whether the situation there has improved. Finally, I would call for the NGOs, in particular, to be given a key role, because it is they who are promoting awareness, and this is something which needs to be done not only among women, but also among men. They need to be involved in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will join that group of people who just said that real progress was made on many issues at the New York Conference. Women’s human rights, the trade in women, violence against women, women’s economic rights, the status of civil society: we may be pleased about the progress that has been made in all these issues. It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that. We were there as observers, but it is to be hoped that we were also able to influence the way the talks went – at least in some respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal’s leadership. This is a promising sign that we will also be able to strengthen legislation on equality within the context of the European Union. I myself do not remember seeing such single-mindedness, and for that thanks go to the chairman and, obviously, the Commission as well. The only exception among the candidate countries was Poland, which was not at all interested in supporting the strengthening of women’s rights in the same way as the Member States of the European Union and the other candidate countries. I would appeal to Commissioner Patten that when enlargement negotiations are being conducted, serious attention be paid to Poland’s compliance with EU legislation on equality and its recognition of women’s rights. I also think that greater attention must be paid to women’s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries, as it is there that glaring violations of human rights, particularly in respect of women, take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years’ time.</p>

I wonder if, bearing this figure in mind, we really had the right to lecture people in New York and to advocate women’s rights in such a vigorous way. After this introduction, with which I am sure almost everyone will agree, I shall say a few things that certain Members present will be less pleased to hear.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there were two problems inherent in the debates in New York: one of content and one of form. For a Union delegation to experience only two problems is quite reasonable, but they are crucial ones. The first concerns the tendency of delegations to speak on behalf of our Parliament. It should be pointed out that one does not speak on behalf of a legislative Assembly, but on behalf of an executive! In fact, the legislative body can express its will only through its votes and no delegate from our Assembly has the right to speak on its behalf: they are only entitled to speak on their own behalf and they are only delegates from the point of view of protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">This playing to the Assembly’s gallery was expressed in New York by an extremist minority, which is trying to impose a Malthusian policy. A palpable threat was made by our so-called representatives towards Poland, a free and sovereign country. This threat also involved insults being made.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The threat lay in the fact that, as was pointed out just now, it was suggested to the Polish Minister that, if he did not accept the will of the so-called delegates of the European Parliament, Poland’s membership process would be slowed down. You can imagine that, for a country such as Poland, this pressure to align itself, imposed by the forces of the Amsterdam pact, presents a terrible image.</p>
<p class="contents">The insult lay in the fact that the Polish Minister was compared to an Ayatollah, simply because he was advocating family values and refused to accept a Malthusian policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, let us point out once again that joining the European Union is conditional upon compliance with the Treaty criteria and on the assent of Parliament, not the personal whims of some of its Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Education is still the most effective instrument for ensuring that women can freely exercise their rights and for allowing greater access to positions of responsibility, both in the workplace and in public life.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge of new technologies has been considered to be of great importance in terms of allowing full participation in the society of the future. The media is of enormous importance as it can allow women’s voices to be heard, and can transmit an image, without stereotypes, which is committed to society and the quest for solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s health is one of the priorities of the meeting’s final document, with special mention of the spread of Aids, especially in certain areas of the planet, which affects women in a particular way and requires special measures for prevention and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence, which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation. Violence against women and girls will be punishable by law, which means that there will have to be legislative reforms in the countries where it is not yet considered a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty particularly affecting women must be eradicated, and this is why the countries which have signed the agreement will send 0.7% of their GDP to development programmes aimed at eliminating what has come to be called the feminisation of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation has generated new problems which particularly affect women, such as trafficking in human beings, prostitution and drug-trafficking, which should be combated so that women may live a dignified and free life in conditions of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">All these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and, in order to ensure they are complied with, we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth programme for equality promoted by the European Commission must serve to promote the position of women, to eliminate the remaining inequalities, integrating gender policies into all Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world. The European Union’s position, given that it has a higher level of development and, therefore, better conditions for women, must not allow us to forget the situation of women in other areas, where daily hardships are combined with malnutrition, extreme poverty and a complete lack of respect for their fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Women’s Conference at the UN in New York came perilously close to failing. A small group of Catholic and Islamic fundamentalist countries clearly intended to undermine the progress achieved by women from around the world in Beijing five years ago. </p>
<p class="contents">The issues which created the most problems were women’s rights to sex education, free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS. These issues united certain Islamic and Catholic countries ranging all the way from the Sudan, Iran and Libya to the Vatican, Nicaragua and Poland, which were prime movers in the fight against these rights. Some countries attempted to quash wordings about governments’ responsibility to protect women from various forms of violence. In spite of the fact that, last week, we were in danger of turning the clock back, we eventually agreed upon a final document which looks ahead to progress on the basis of the Women’s Conference in Beijing and, at the same time, marks out the route towards increased equality in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the Presidency of the EU, especially the minister Mrs De Belém Roseira, actively contributed to a successful final outcome, something we would thank her for. The final document embodies progress in certain respects. Forced marriages and murders committed for reasons of honour are mentioned for the first time in an agreed international document. On the issues of rape within marriage, right of possession and right of inheritance, together with the right to asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, the wordings have been strengthened. Women’s right to equal participation in macro-economic decision-making, together with the allocation of quotas with a view to increasing women’s participation in political parties and parliaments are other matters which are being taken up. </p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we are to vote on demands that the institutions of the EU, Member States and candidate States make active efforts to turn the final document from Beijing +5 into a reality. It is especially important that <span class="italic">all</span> candidate States, including Poland, undertake to abide by the EU’s policy on women’s rights. What are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The women’s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths. This became clear in New York when Islamic fundamentalists attacked what, in recent years, has characterised women’s demands: an end to domestic rape and violence, an end to the right for men to commit <span class="italic">crimes passionnelles</span> and an end to female circumcision. However, it must, of course, be appreciated – as Commissioner Patten said, moreover – that the Conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women’s rights as human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">However, similar positions on sexual rights, sexual health and the self-determination of women have caused an unholy alliance – evident at Beijing – to be formed between Christian and Islamic fundamentalists, including the Vatican, Poland, Nicaragua and a number of Islamic countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference, and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings, but that there was an absence of tangible, verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty. I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An example of this, and this is an appeal to the Council, is the issue of wage discrimination. It has been demonstrated that, compared to men doing the same work, women receive 50 or up to 80 per cent less. This is not in our legislation. Nevertheless, it appears that the European Union approves of it. I wonder if the Portuguese Presidency, before the end of its mandate, could make a recommendation in this respect. It also seemed extremely important to me, Mr Patten, that in the meeting in New York, when the policy of microcredits was discussed – loans to certain women so that they may be given access to financial autonomy – the countries recognised that these programmes of microcredits had been a complete success.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Commission and the European Union, given such a positive assessment, not implement these programmes so that the European Union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies? Please answer me, Mr Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Parliament’s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries. Our work has been outstanding in this respect. I do have reservations with regard to Poland, but precisely because Parliament’s delegation played such a significant role. Mr Varaut, you are very badly informed. You have made a fool of yourself. You were not in New York, but I was. Your information is not accurate. It is not even true. Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false.

<p class="contents">It has already been said many times: the work carried out by the UN and in New York has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since Beijing. Women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society’s resources. The need to continue the fight against all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability and sexual orientation, which are still rife throughout the world, has become clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies, from employment to development, from social policies to the fight against violence. There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women’s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the European Union, particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy. In this regard, I would like to draw Commissioner Patten’s attention to the Commission’s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty affects women more than anybody else. Therefore, we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development. If globalisation is to provide new opportunities, it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people, globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swiebel (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the World Conference on Women, which was held five years ago, meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women’s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment. In contrast to this, I have mixed feelings about the UN Conference which was held in New York last week. On the one hand, it was confirmed that it is up to governments to guarantee equal rights for women and to pursue sound emancipation policy, and, despite many people’s fears, no retrograde steps were taken. On the other hand, it was once again impossible to reach agreement on sensitive issues which had not been resolved at Beijing, such as the recognition of the right to self-determination for women in their personal life, including their free choice in pregnancy and sexual behaviour or sexual preference. This is greatly disappointing. Actual equality and freedom for women is only possible if all options are open to them and if the traditional family image is not held up to them as the only true one. Resistance of the kind displayed by governments, diplomats and officials last week, is a form of rearguard action, however. It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes. The fight goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">The true inspiration which I gained from last week’s conference in New York lay in the power of the international women’s movement which, contrary to popular belief, is as vigorous and alive as ever and is also bolstered by a new generation of young women who, strong and well-informed, stand up for all kinds of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and Member State representatives showed great commitment during the Conference to the issue of sexual self-determination for women and the non-discrimination principle pursuant to Article 13. The fact that this did not end up in the final document should not be a reflection on them. What can, however, be expected of the Council and Commission, is that they put their money where their mouths are in their respective Chambers. In addition to what we obtained last week, namely reparative legislation on equality in work and professional life, they should produce new additional legislation to prevent sex discrimination across the entire range of social life. Article 13 offers the opportunity to do so and the Beijing +5 Conference issued an instruction to this effect. </p>
<p class="contents">Surely a European Union which, at international conferences, is full of rhetoric on banishing sex discrimination should set about developing effective policy instruments which can attain this goal at the level of the Union itself.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conferences on violence against women, trafficking of women and reconciling family and professional life, together with the UN conference on Beijing+5, are clear examples of the Portuguese Presidency’s involvement in this area. Anyone at the UN last week, like myself, would know that, in the end, we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document. The difficulties were immense. I feel that it was both the work of the Presidency and the Commission and the involvement of all the female Members of this House who were there, and who joined with the national MPs of the Fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of Poland, which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say that the European Union has a decisive role to play in this issue. We must lead the way in defending women’s rights and we must continue the work in this respect. The resolution approved by the European Parliament was greatly appreciated in the UN. I must thank the President-in-Office for having come directly from Canada to Strasbourg so as not to miss this meeting which is so important to us. I know that, since Monday of last week, she has been constantly dealing with women’s issues both in the USA and in Canada. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also say very sincerely and with immense gratitude that the conduct of this work in this way was only possible because we all – the Presidency, the Commission, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations – cooperated together. This was also possible because the bilateral contacts which we each maintain, by working hard at them and thereby multiplying their effectiveness, were vital in the end result. I am extremely grateful to everyone for this.</p>
<p class="contents">When I spoke, it was clearly on behalf of all the Member States of the European Union and of all the applicant countries except for Poland. In the contacts established with Poland, it has been made very clear that accession cannot be exchanged for non-recognition of women’s rights. The European Union could not take any other position on such an issue. Women will no longer accept their fundamental rights being regarded as a bargaining chip for political issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area. These must be achieved through cooperation, particularly with all like-minded countries, some of which, like Canada, are totally committed to the Presidency’s statement presented at the end of the special conference. We must take advantage of all these opportunities. These developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the Lisbon Special Summit, which considered that in Europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion. In this way the European Union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing, measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I referred to the Portuguese Presidency’s work on the issue of discrimination in the European Union. Portugal is also very pleased that, in the last Social Affairs and Employment Council, a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life. Women are constantly being penalised because the time that they devote to family life gives employers objective reasons to discriminate against them in wage terms. Therefore, in my opinion, we have already achieved what was asked of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must thank the President and the whole House for your kindness and the comments which you have made, and I also thank the Commission for its support. The Portuguese Presidency is now coming to an end and sincerely hopes that the subsequent French and Swedish Presidencies will continue the work which we have together managed to achieve so that they represent the next stage in the consolidation of women’s rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, the Members of the European Parliament who were in New York as part of the European Union delegation, which comprised 15 people with observer status, were not allowed to speak because, in accordance with the UN’s procedure for extraordinary general assemblies, the Portuguese Presidency spoke on behalf of the European Union. The Commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session. Even in the working parties, we were not allowed to take the floor, which was always given to the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not, therefore, put words into the mouths of the Members of this Parliament who were in New York. In no instance did we speak in an official capacity, still less on behalf of this Parliament, although we did have some useful discussions with the Commission and the Council, with Members of the Parliaments of Member States and associated States, who allowed us to convey our views. What were banned from these meetings were the positions that Parliament adopted under the Smet/Gröner report, and nothing else.</p>
