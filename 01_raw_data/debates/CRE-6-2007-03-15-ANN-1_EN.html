<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>I should first like to observe that the German Presidency and its future Portuguese and Slovenian successors have, in their shared eighteen-month programme, undertaken to ensure continuity in the development of modern, social and sustainable labour law across the EU, and the further measures following on from the Commission communication on the Community health and safety at work strategy for 2007-2012 will play a part in this, in precisely the same way as will the Green Paper recently presented by the Commission on the future of labour law. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Strategy for 2002-2006 took account of the changing nature of work and of the new kinds of risks that this entails, to which the honourable Member, in his question, was quite right to refer. These risks will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming health and safety at work strategy, and will also feature in the conclusions of the Employment Council in May.</p>
<p>A whole series of directives on working conditions have been adopted in the course of recent years, and the honourable Member will no doubt be aware, as regards the specific issue of an employer’s liability for its employees’ health and safety, of the Community legislation currently in force on this subject, including the framework directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, and already nineteen individual directives laying down minimum requirements in specific areas of protection at work. Nor must it be forgotten that responsibility for the implementation of this legislation rests with the Member States and that it is they alone who are responsible for any provisions relating to compensation. Liability for applying the regulations rests with employers, and the competent national authorities ensure that they are enforced, while the Commission’s function is to monitor the full transposition of the directives into national law, and it is authorised to initiate, where necessary, proceedings in respect of infringement of the Treaties. It also monitors the practical implementation of the directives, to which end it receives regular reports from the Member States. I would like to point out that the Commission has just presented a new directive on the simplification and rationalisation of reports on practical measures taken in this area.</p>
<p>The German Presidency is working closely with Parliament in order to achieve agreement on this proposal at as early a date as possible.</p>
<p>Within the broader context of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, the Council is just now completing the annual review of the various components of the European Employment Strategy. It was on the basis of this work that the Employment Council, on 22 February 2007, formulated a series of key messages with clear demands for structural improvements in the labour market and stronger social cohesion, which were forwarded to the European Council for its Spring Summit.</p>
<p>The Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee played an active part in formulating these key messages, which state positions on such subjects as, for example, the modernisation of labour law and appropriate levels of social protection.</p>
<p>I can therefore assure the honourable Member that the Council, under German Presidency, is playing its part in maintaining and improving health protection and the safety of workers in the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0095"></a>

<p>The Council is currently taking the steps required in order to comply with the ruling of the Court of First Instance, and has already taken the first steps towards improving its procedures for drawing up the list referred to in Regulation 2580/2001 of persons and entities involved in terrorist acts. The Council aims, wherever possible, to present every person or entity whose assets are to be frozen with a justification and to make procedures clearer and more transparent, thereby enabling the persons and bodies included on the list to ask for their cases to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The Council has already, in connection with its Decision of 21 December 2006 on the addition of certain persons and associations to the list of persons, associations and entities whose assets are to be frozen (Council Decision 3006/1008/EG, OJ L379 of 28 December 2006), produced justifications, which have been made available to those persons and associations affected. The Council has also informed these persons and associations as to the procedural steps they can take in order to make their views known.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Council, on 30 January 2007, decided to comply with the Court’s decision in the PMOI case and to notify MEK/PMOI of its intention to retain it on the list of persons and entities whose assets are to be frozen and also to justify this decision to them.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is familiar with the matter to which the honourable Member refers, which has to do with good neighbourly relations and the Cyprus issue.</p>
<p>As regards good neighbourly relations, I would refer to the conclusions on the subject adopted by the European Council when it met in Helsinki in 1999 and in Brussels in December 2004, in which it called for an unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations, which would involve the avoidance of all acts capable of having an adverse effect on the peaceful settlement of disputes, a position confirmed by the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council on 11 December 2006.</p>
<p>Further to the Cyprus issue in general, I would like briefly to repeat that Turkey’s continued support for efforts towards a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus issue within the United Nations and in harmony with the EU’s fundamental principles, together with progress in the normalisation of bilateral relations between Turkey and all EU Member States including the Republic of Cyprus are among the demands, by compliance with which the progress made in the accession process will be measured.</p>
<p>The points referred to above also constitute part of the negotiating framework and are among the short-term priorities of the revised accession partnership with Turkey that the EU is systematically raising at the meetings with Turkey in the course of the Political Dialogue. I can assure you that we attach great importance to these points and are closely monitoring developments, since progress made on this front will have effects, inter alia, on the continuation of the accession negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0098"></a>

<p>In March 2006 the Home Affairs Ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom agreed at an informal summit to look into the possibility of introducing a ‘European integration contract’ or a ‘European examination’ for immigrants wishing to become citizens of EU Member States. According to reports, this type of ‘contract’ is intended to supplement the citizenship examinations that already exist in some EU Member States. The ministers agreed to have this proposal examined by their national experts.</p>
<p>What would this ‘European integration contract’ consist of? What obligations are included in this document? What is its status?

<p>The presidency wishes to point out that it has no remit to make statements on the deliberations of the so-called ‘G-6’.</p>
<p>The EU is in fact working towards greater cooperation in the field of integration policy. Even though the adoption and implementation of national integration strategies will, in future, continue to fall within the remit of the Member States, the EU will continue to support them by, inter alia, encouraging the sharing of experience and best practice, but deliberations at EU level have not so far made reference to the concept of an integration contract.</p>
<p>It should, finally, be noted that the European Council, in its conclusion of 14/15 December 2006, agreed that, in the course of 2007, integration and intercultural dialogue, together with the combating of every form of discrimination within the Member States and the EU, would be promoted, that integration policy would be strengthened, and that agreement would be reached on common goals and strategies.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In its 2 December 2002 recommendation on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council stated that the Member States, in view of the risks associated with passive smoking, should endeavour to protect smokers and non-smokers from tobacco smoke. It recommended that they should bring in legislation and/or other effective measures to guarantee protection from tobacco smoke in the workplace, in closed rooms, in closed public amenities and on public transport.</p>
<p>The intention of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is that present and future generations should be protected from tobacco consumption and pollution of the environment through tobacco smoke be prevented. The Commission and all the Member States (with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic) have ratified the FCTC, which contains a specifically binding obligation on the contracting parties to protect human beings from the nuisance of tobacco smoke. Article 8 of the FCTC states that every contracting party must bring effective measures to protect against passive smoking in the workplace, in closed rooms, on public transport, in closed public amenities, and, where necessary, in other public places.</p>
<p>On 30 January 2007, the Commission adopted a Green Paper entitled ‘Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke; policy options at EU level’. Its objective in doing so is to initiate a comprehensive consultation process (until 1 May 2007) on the best way to stem passive smoking in the EU and support the trend towards smoke-free zones in the EU. The presidency has already drawn the Council’s attention to this Green Paper. It is planned that the Council (Employment and Social Affairs) on 31 May 2007 should include an exchange of views among the ministers on the Green Paper.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council takes the view that a reduction in administrative costs for companies and, in particular, SMUs is an important measure in terms of strengthening competitivity and economic growth in the EU. On 19 February 2007, the Council considered the Commission programme of action seeking to reduce administrative costs, concluding that a major joint effort was necessary to achieve any significant reduction of administrative costs within the EU. It agreed that a 25% reduction in the administrative costs of implementing EU rules must be achieved by the year 2012 and that the Member States should set themselves ambitious international goals by 2008, calling on the Commission to launch its programme of action with the support of the Member States on this basis.</p>
<p>In order to emphasise the importance it attaches to progress in this area, the Council decided to give priority to the immediate measures recommended in the Commission communication as soon as the relevant Commission proposals had been tabled.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0104"></a>

<p>The Council is following the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia with very close attention. As part of its political dialogue with all third countries, the EU strongly recommends them all to ratify all relevant international agreements on human rights where they have not already done so.</p>
<p>The European Union strongly advocates the removal of all forms of discrimination and intolerance and, with this in mind, tabled a resolution for the 61st session of the UN General Assembly calling for the abolition of all forms of intolerance and discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, the unanimous adoption of which testifies to the universal applicability of its content. The European Union therefore calls on third countries to put into practice the principles of this resolution, which has been recognised as an important instrument for the purpose of protecting the right of every individual person to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0107"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The control and monitoring of the external frontiers is the Member States’ responsibility. Border controls are not, however, operated only in the interests of the Member State concerned, but in the interests of all those Member States that have abolished controls on the internal borders. The establishment of Frontex, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, through Council Regulation 2007/2004/EC<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> was an important step in the promotion of solidarity between the Member States in the protection of the external borders.</p>
<p>Frontex coordinates the operational cooperation of the Member States and manages joint operations and pilot projects on the land, air and sea borders.</p>
<p>In order to help those Member States whose borders come under sudden and extraordinary pressure, the Commission has submitted a proposal for the Parliament and Council Regulation establishing a mechanism for the creation of rapid border intervention teams. This proposal is currently being discussed by the Council with a view to attempting to reach agreement with Parliament at first reading stage.</p>
<p>The Member States will also be able to contribute to the protection of the external borders by providing each other with technical equipment. Frontex is currently, on the basis of Article 7 of Regulation 2007/2004/EC, compiling a central registry of items of technical equipment (known as the ‘toolbox’) which Member States are willing to make available to other Member States. At the 15 February 2007 Council meeting, Frontex presented an inventory, and those Member States that had not done so already were urged to make an active contribution to the toolbox, which it is intended should be available for use with effect from summer 2007.</p>
<p>Frontex has also completed two feasibility studies (BORTEC and MEDSEA) on the protection of maritime borders in 2006, the object of which is the establishment of a European monitoring system for the southern maritime borders, to which priority is being given in line with the Presidency’s conclusions on the meeting of the European Council of December 2006, and Frontex is being urged to develop as soon as possible a permanent network of coastal patrols on the southern sea borders. Frontex is currently giving consideration to how to create this network and involve the Member States in it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament’s March 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Community Code on the movement of persons across borders (‘Schengen Borders Code’) which was adopted on 15 March 2006 by the European Parliament and the Council by the codecision procedure<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> governs controls on persons crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. This Code is binding and applicable in all Member States, with the exception of Ireland the United Kingdom, from the date of its entry into force, that is, 13 October 2006, as well as in Bulgaria and Romania from the date of their accession to the EU.</p>
<p>The requirements governing border protection are therefore identical and binding for all these Member States, even if, under the terms of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession, the provisions of the Schengen ‘acquis’ incorporated in the EU concerning the dismantling of controls on persons at the internal borders with and between those Member States which acceded in 2004 and 2007 have not yet entered into force. These provisions will apply in those Member States on the basis of a decision to be taken by the Council following an assessment - conducted in accordance with the Schengen evaluation procedure - of whether the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen ‘acquis’ have been met and after consulting the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Controls at the internal borders with Romania and Bulgaria can only be lifted once the Schengen ‘acquis’ (Schengen Information System II) has been implemented and in particular if the relevant assessments in those Member States are positive.</p>
<p>All Member States, including Romania and Bulgaria, are involved at all levels in the Council in discussing the issues of border protection, trafficking in human beings and organised crime.</p>
<p>Border protection and border controls have been - or are currently being - assessed in each new Member State in order to establish whether they meet the requirements of the Schengen ‘acquis’ and therefore whether controls on persons may be lifted at the internal borders. Assessments will be carried out for Bulgaria and Romania as soon as these countries have declared themselves ready.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The regime's treatment of opponents in Djibouti raises a number of questions, particularly in the light of the fact that parliamentary elections are to be held there in January 2008.</p>
<p>How does the Council intend to go about ensuring long-term respect for human rights in Djibouti and, with this in mind, does it intend to support the organisation of a European election observation mission to the country in 2008?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is aware of the recent arrest of members of the Mouvement pour le renouveau démocratique (MRD) and of staff of the independent weekly paper Le Renouveau. The regular political dialogue with Djibouti under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement is the proper context in which the EU can raise its concerns about the human rights situation in Djibouti and – bearing in mind the agreed objective of promoting a stable and democratic political environment – can address questions on the political state of affairs in that country in the most general terms.</p>
<p>By the same token, the promotion of local democracy and of responsible state governance through support for the development and functioning of decentralised institutions that would serve as pillars of democracy is one of the objectives of Europe’s cooperation with Djibouti.</p>
<p>As regards the possible dispatch of an EU election observation mission to Djibouti’s parliamentary elections in January 2008, the priorities for the EU’s election-monitoring activities in 2008 have not yet been discussed by the relevant groupings within the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0117"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor its members was not given orally during Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is fully aware of the importance of alternative energy sources in the transport sector from the point of view of not only sustainable supply but also measures to slow down climate change and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Following the energy and climate package published by the Commission on 10 January 2007, the Council of Energy Ministers in its conclusions of 15 February 2007, indicated that a 10% biofuel component of total petrol and diesel consumption for transport purposes was the binding minimum objective to be achieved by 2020 in all EU Member States. This objective was confirmed by the European Council at its spring session. The Council of Energy Ministers concluded that the objective should be binding subject to sustainable production, the commercial availability of second-generation biofuels and an appropriate amendment to the directive on fuel quality, making it possible to use suitable mixtures.</p>
<p>In its conclusions, the Council also seeks a coherent framework for renewable energies on the basis of the forthcoming Commission proposal for 2007 concerning a new comprehensive directive on the use of all renewable energy sources, together with the comprehensive and rapid implementation of the measures recommended in the Council conclusions concerning the Commission biomass action plan of June 2006, particularly regarding second-generation biofuel demonstration projects.</p>
<p>The Council attaches particular importance to this matter and as soon as the Commission has submitted its proposal will follow developments closely. It also hopes that the European Parliament will be able to give the same level of support and thereby facilitate adoption of the proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0119"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council or its Members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament’s March 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As no major developments have taken place in the country in question, the Council intends to maintain the Common Position in its present form, subject to technical adjustments. The Presidency takes the view that the Common Position continues to constitute an appropriate combination of targeted restrictive measures and humanitarian aid for the population of one of the poorest countries in the world. On the basis of the Common Position, the EU regularly expresses its concern to the government and regional partners able to influence that country and presses for changes in Burma/Myanmar. Issues such as human rights violations, including forced labour, the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and the absence of a genuine and comprehensive transitional process towards a legitimate, democratic government are regularly raised as part of this process.</p>
<p>The Council has actively supported the efforts of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to take up complaints about forced labour in Burma/Myanmar. The government of Burma/Myanmar reached an agreement at the end of February this year with the ILO on addressing these complaints.</p>
<p>The EU is already using Community resources to support active civil society groups both within and outside Burma/Myanmar. The overall financial commitment for programmes in Burma/Myanmar has considerably increased, and the Commission intends to make available even more resources from 2007. Alongside geographical budget lines, a series of thematic budgetary lines will be entered, and support for civil society and respect for human rights will be an integral part thereof.</p>
<p>The EU has repeatedly called on the government of Burma/Myanmar to embark on a comprehensive transitional process in which all forces in the country, including the individual ethnic groups, must take part. Furthermore, the EU considers that a long-term stabilisation of the country is only possible if it takes place through national reconciliation, which requires the participation of all ethnic groups of the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0121"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The author of the question is advised that Mr Gerhard Schröder is not the chairman of the supervisory board of Nord Stream AG, but rather the chairman of the said company’s shareholders’ committee.</p>
<p>Further to the first question, the presidency wishes to make it clear that it does not comment on reports in the media.</p>
<p>Further to the second question, the presidency wishes to observe that – as the honourable Member is no doubt aware – European Parliament and Council Decision 1364/2006/EC laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision 96/391/EC and Decision No 1229/2003/EC<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>makes reference to a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany running through the Baltic Sea or ‘via the offshore route’ at the following three points:</p>
<p>in Annex I ‘Axes for priority projects, including sites of projects of European interest, as defined in Articles 7 and 8’, item NG 1,</p>
<p>in Annex II ‘Additional criteria for identifying Projects of common interest, as referred to in Article 6(2)’, under ‘Gas networks’, item 9</p>
<p>in Annex III ‘Projects of common interest and their specifications, currently identified according to the criteria set out in Annex II’ under item 9, ‘Developing gas transport capacity (gas supply pipelines)’ as the third of the projects listed there: ‘North European gas pipeline: Russia, Baltic Sea, Germany’.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, the Council and Parliament have, in Annex I to the Decision, categorised a ‘North European gas pipeline’ as a ‘project of European interest’ – a term denoting the projects given ‘the highest priority’ (q.v recital 8).</p>
<p>As regards the specific provisions for projects with this status (e.g. the option of Community cofinancing, the obligations of the Member States in respect of these projects and the action of a European coordinator in the event of serious delays or problems with implementation) the Council refers the honourable Member to the text of the Decision already mentioned above, which was adopted by Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>For the reasons set out below, the presidency, while respecting the honourable Member’s viewpoint, does not agree with it. The terms 'mass gatherings' or 'similar major events' in Article 18 of the draft Council Decision on stepping up cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, does not in any way result in an ‘unprecedented process of surveillance and control’ nor does it facilitate one. The Council wishes to point out to the honourable Member that Article 18 of the said Council Decision does no more than commit the competent authorities in the Member States to mutual support in respect of ‘mass gatherings, similar major events, and grave calamities’, which shall take the form of measures specified under this heading. Article 18 does not, however, constitute a legal basis for surveillance measures that have not hitherto been in place.</p>
<p>As regards terrorist offences, the obligations under Article 16 of the draft Council Decision are restricted to the exchange of information where ‘the assumption is justified on the basis of certain facts that the persons concerned are likely to commit offences of the kind referred to in Articles 1 to 3 of the Council of the European Union’s Framework Decision 2002/475/JI on the combating of terrorism’. Here, too, no obligations are imposed in respect of further surveillance or investigation and the obligation is limited solely to cooperation.</p>
<p>The honourable Member’s fears that the police and public order authorities would interfere in citizens’ private affairs and hence that the freedom to express opinions would be restricted without the same authorities being required to account for their action to a democratic body of control are not justified. The maintenance of public order has always been one of the most important functions of the police services in the Member States, and this is not a function that can be derived from the draft of this Council Decision. All measures taken by police forces on the basis of this draft are subject to the control of the supervisory authorities established for the oversight of the police in accordance with the legislation adopted by the Member States. As regards data protection, the draft Council Decision contains especially stringent provisions on this subject, in the shape of Articles 24 to 32, which are applicable to all information shared in accordance with this Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0140"></a>

<p>We are concerned that Nigeria intends to adopt a law entitled 'Act to Make Provisions for the Prohibition of Relationship Between Persons of the Same Sex, Celebration of Marriage by Them, and for Other Matters Connected Therewith.'

The proposed law clearly violates the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and is also in violation of the Cotonou Agreement Article 1, which calls for 'respect of the rights of the individual' and Article 8, which calls for a political dialogue where respect for human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law and good governance are essential prerequisites for the validity of the agreement.</p>
<p>Will the Council raise the issue of this law in its discussions with the Nigerian Government?

<p>The Council recently underscored its firm commitment to combating climate change in its conclusions of 20 February.

<p>In recent months, there has been an alarming increase in the wave of illegal immigrants arriving in Greece, on the islands of the eastern Aegean, from Turkey. In 2006, 20% of the illegal immigrants arrested came from Turkey (as opposed to 15.5% in 2004 and 11.9% in 2005).</p>
<p>Greece and Turkey signed a Readmission Protocol in April 2002 and, over the period as a whole, the Greek authorities have submitted applications to Turkey in respect of 22 945 illegal immigrants arrested, only 1419 of which have been repatriated. In its report (November 2006) on Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission notes in regard to negotiating Chapter 24 (Justice, Freedom and Security) that Turkey has made little progress in tackling illegal immigration and that a tremendous effort is needed to bring the country into line with the Community acquis. Does the Council intend to take initiatives to speed up the necessary reforms and their correct application by Turkey in this specific area? There is also a significant problem with the cost of transporting illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the external borders of the Member States of the European Union, could use Community financial means to tackle these specific problems on the basis of Article 9 (Return cooperation) of its founding Regulation (EC) No. 2007/2004<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>That the Council attaches great importance to the efforts to be made by Turkey, as an applicant country, to combat illegal immigration, is not a matter of doubt, and it was for this reason that this consideration was included in the short-term priorities of the revised accession partnership adopted by the Council on 23 January, in which context there is explicit reference to the requirement that a readmission agreement be concluded without delay. This issue is also discussed in the screening report on negotiating chapter 24 (justice, freedom and security), which is currently being examined by the Council. The Community has repeatedly stated that these negotiations have to be completed promptly, and this is, no doubt, continuing to be made clear at all levels, in particular within the forums set up under the association agreement.</p>
<p>Under Article 9 of the Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Agency provides the support required for the organisation of joint return operations on the part of the Member States. Under this Article, the Agency may also use Community funds allocated for the purpose of returns. The presidency therefore takes the view that the Agency may use Community funds allocated for the purpose of returns in order – subject to the Community’s policy on returns – to support joint returns operations on the part of the Member States. It should be noted that this applies only in the case of joint operations to return illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The issue of the participation and role of Frontex in the organisation of joint return operations by air is currently being discussed at Council level. It was also the subject of the Council conclusions on improved operational cooperation on joint return operations by air, adopted on 27 April 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its conclusions dated 15 May 2006, the Council stated the urgent necessity of the commanders of the ‘Lord's Resistance Army’ (LRA) being arrested and brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to answer the charges laid against them before it. It called on both the Ugandan Government and Uganda’s neighbouring states to act together to ensure that the warrants for their arrest were put into effect.</p>
<p>The Council is also following with attention, and is strongly supportive of, the peace process between the LRA and the Ugandan Government. It has encouraged the parties in that process to continue to work together towards a sustainable peace agreement that establishes peace and justice and is compatible with national and international law, including the ICC’s Rome Statute. The Council has also strongly urged all representatives of regional interests to adopt a favourable stance in respect of the peace process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0153"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The accessions of Bulgaria and Romania brought the fifth enlargement round to a close. The December 2006 European Council reiterated that the EU stands by the undertakings given to Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey as candidates for accession. The European Council also made it clear that the speed of the accession process would depend on the results of reforms in the country with which negotiations were in progress, with each country being assessed on a case-by-case basis. The European Union has again pointed out to the states of the Western Balkans that the progress of each of them on its way to the European Union will depend on efforts each of them makes to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditions of the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p>
<p>That these general principles also apply to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is self-evident. It was with the desire to particularly acknowledge the progress made in the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement that the European Council, in December 2005, accorded the country candidate status. Although the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has continued to make progress, it has to be said – as the Commission did indeed point out in its last progress report in November 2006 – that it has done so at a slower pace. The areas remaining outstanding must now be addressed with all speed; they include the priorities in European partnership and the further implementation of the said agreement. The government has major challenges to contend with, particularly as regards police and justice reform and the fight against corruption. It follows, then, that the pace of the accession process is primarily dependent on the efforts and achievements of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia itself, which will be discussed in the Commission’s next progress report. The Union will continue to actively support the country in its efforts to achieve this objective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0155"></a>

<p>The European Council continues to support efforts towards a negotiated long-term solution to the issue of Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Following the report by the Director-General of the IAEO on 22 February to the UN Security Council, the Council had, on 5 March, an exchange of views on the Iranian nuclear question. The Council’s position on this can be summed up by saying that the EU continues to take a twin-track approach to Iran. The EU is implementing the measure referred to in UN Security Council resolution 1737, which are aimed at the most vulnerable parts of the Iranian nuclear and rocketry programme. At the same time, the Council is to continue to support efforts towards a negotiated long-term solution that would pave the way for a new relationship with Iran founded upon mutual respect and extended cooperation. With regard to this, the Council recalls the wide-ranging proposals presented to Iran on 6 June 2006 by the EU’s High Representative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0156"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is surely aware, Parliament and the Council have recently adopted the Decision<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>No 1982/2006/EC on the Seventh European Community Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration (2007-2013) and the Decision<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>No 1639/2006/EC on establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme(2007-2013).</p>
<p>These two programmes constitute the main measures intended to be applied in all those sectors in which they are needed in order to close the gap between the European Union and its principal competitors in the global market by improving the adoption of the outcomes of research and innovation by industry, by those in positions of political responsibility and society and by putting them more speedily to use. The intention is that these programmes should also serve to achieve one of the EU’s most important objectives, that being an increase in Europe’s potential for economic growth and its greater competitiveness, by means of investments in knowledge, innovation and human capital.</p>
<p>While the programmes differ from one another, they are not exclusive in character. It is expected that they will result in greater coherence and complementarity and in synergy effects with various promotional measures already in place, and that not only at Community level, but also within the Member States, third countries and as part of intergovernmental initiatives such as interventions by the Structural Funds, COST, EUREKA, etc.</p>
<p>At EU level, energy is one of the ten priority subject areas of the specific programme ‘Cooperation’<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which forms part of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The measures of the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’<a href="#defann_29_4" name="refann_29_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>programme are also directly funded from the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation.</p>

<p>In the wake of the unacceptable boycott of the Palestinian Authority decided by the Israeli government and the US administration following the January 2006 elections in Palestine, the EU too has suspended its financial aid. This boycott amounts to the de facto 'punishment' of the Palestinian people, contributing as it does to the further worsening of the already grave humanitarian situation facing the Palestinian people, while also destabilising the Palestinian public institutions, especially the civil service. It is hard to understand how as things stand the EU can propose, as conditions for re-establishing relations with the Palestinian Authority (financial aid included), a 'commitment to non-violence' (when it is Israel that is militarily occupying the Palestinian territories and oppressing the Palestinian people), 'the recognition of Israel' (when in reality Israel does not recognise the Palestinian people's right to an independent sovereign state), and 'respect for the prior agreements and obligations, including the Road Map' (when it is Israel that fails to comply with the UN resolutions, the Oslo agreements and the Road Map itself, and, among other unacceptable attitudes, is carrying on with building an illegal wall and with its policy of settlements in the Palestinian territories).</p>

<p>The Members of the European Parliament, in their question, address the subject of support for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The EU and its partners in the Middle East Quartet have congratulated the Palestinian people on their election process, which resulted in free, fair and secure elections to the Legislative Council on 25 January 2006. It was with the outcome of these elections in mind that the High Representative, Mr Solana, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 5 April 2006, stressed that the EU had no fundamental interest in seeing the Hamas government fail. In its conclusions of 12 February 2007, the Council welcomed the agreement achieved in Mecca on 8 February on the formation of a Palestinian government of national unity. The EU is prepared to work together with a legitimate Palestinian Government that is united on a platform corresponding to the principles of the Quartet, those being the renunciation of violence, the recognition of Israel’s right to exist, and the acceptance of existing agreements and undertakings.</p>
<p>The EU also stressed its commitments to continuing to provide the aid needed in order to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian people, the total value of which amounted, in 2006, to in excess of EUR 650 million, and it also ensured that these efforts were made known to the Palestinian public.</p>
<p>The EU is continuing to work towards a negotiated solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict that will result in the existence of two democratic states coexisting with one another in peace and security.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the March 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As far as the Council is aware, there is no reference, either in the press communiqué given at the end of the 2005 conference in Bergen to which the honourable Member refers, or in the Bologna Process in general, to the compilation of some kind of ‘list’ of universities whose degrees are not recognised. The press communiqué did, however, contain a demand by the Ministers for the ratification of the Lisbon Agreement on degree recognition and a call on the participant countries not only to discuss the problems of recognition noted by the ENRIC/NARIC networks, but also to draw up national action plans for the improvement of the procedures relating to the recognition of academic degrees gained abroad.</p>
<p>The Council recalls that – with the exception of certain regulated professions – there are, under the present treaty, no EU-wide Community regulations prescribing the mutual recognition of degrees, although, according to Article 149 of the European Communities Treaty, one of the goals of Community activity is still the promotion of the recognition of academic degrees and periods of study, and, to this end, a network of information centres has been set up under the patronage of the Commission in order to offer information and advice on the nature and value of academic and professional qualifications gained in the Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the further actions to be taken in this area, the Council wishes to point out that it has already stated their general aspects in response to the Commission proposal on the establishment of a European qualifications framework and now expects Parliament to give its opinion on it.

<p>In general it is either not permitted or very expensive to change names on air tickets. As a result airlines make a lot of money on tickets which the consumer buys but for whatever reason is not able to use. By contrast international rail tickets, including Eurostar, do not require names and are therefore exchangeable.</p>
<p>Does the Commission feel the airlines should recognise this anomaly and make it much easier and cheaper to change names on tickets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) There are no specific rules on the subject in Community law or under international convention. The rule prohibiting the transfer of tickets from one person to another is a purely commercial practice introduced by most airlines. One reason for doing so was to prevent any occurrence of arbitrage, such as when a travel company buys seats at a low price a few months before travel takes place and then sells them on to consumers at a higher price just before departure.</p>
<p>It would appear that the practice also helps airlines to deal with all the passenger data they handle. Their task is facilitated by the fact that the data are known in advance, hence there is no need for them to be fed into the system manually at the last minute - something which might cause delays at check-in. Even though only a minority of passengers would be affected, the last-minute transfer of tickets would undoubtedly cause major problems in the case of flights using wide-bodied aircraft carrying several hundred passengers.</p>
<p>No airline is under any obligation to transfer tickets, although some do so under certain circumstances (even via the Internet) - for which service a small charge is often payable.</p>
<p>In these circumstances it is not clear how legislation covering this particular point would necessarily be to the advantage of consumers and the airline industry.</p>
<p>Passengers must be conversant with the conditions attached to the tickets which they purchase. In this connection the Commission is particularly concerned that the information offered to passengers should be as clear as possible and that the requirement for clarity should be laid down in EU law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0131"></a>

<p>(FR) The economies of the countries in the Baltic region enjoy a higher growth rate compared with the average for the European Union. This results in an increased need for transport between the Baltic countries and the countries outside of this zone.</p>
<p>Among the 30 priority projects of the Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T) identified by Parliament and the Council in 2004, seven relate to the Baltic Sea region. Despite the limited possibilities afforded by the TEN budget (2007-2013), the new Member States should be able – thanks to access to regional funds and more particularly to the Cohesion Fund – to realise most of the priority projects within the prescribed time limits but also to modernise their rail and road networks as well as some of the ports and airports that are of regional or international importance.</p>
<p>Maritime transport plays an increasingly important role in the Baltic region; approximately 50% of external trade goes by sea. Investment in port infrastructure and in the hinterland must therefore receive special attention. Motorways of the sea are also an important factor. They have been identified in the Commission’s communication on the extension of the major trans-European transport axes to the neighbouring countries as one of the five transnational axes that contribute most to promoting international exchanges, trade and traffic and that should make it possible to strengthen regional cooperation and integration in the longer term. The Northern axis is particularly relevant for the Baltic Sea region. It would connect Russia and Norway with the Northern and Baltic Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) Efforts to promote and develop European entrepreneurship are at the heart of the Lisbon strategy. Enhancing the role of education in creating a more entrepreneurial culture is crucial if we want more Europeans to embark in promising business ventures and overcome fears linked to setting up a business, such as the fear of business failure. Consequently, entrepreneurship education both at the Community and the Member State level is amongst the Commission's Priorities identified by the Spring Council.</p>
<p>To foster entrepreneurial mindsets, entrepreneurship has to become an appealing opportunity for young people. Accordingly, the inclusion of entrepreneurship in national school curricula or the support of lifelong learning figure prominently on the growth and jobs strategy agenda. The 2006 Commission Communication on “Fostering entrepreneurial mindsets through education and learning” clearly invites Member States to develop more systematic strategies, including helping the creation of student mini-companies.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a Recommendation on Key Competences, adopted on 9<span class="sup">th</span> November 2005, stresses the need to offer all young people the means to develop entrepreneurship and other key competences through initial education in the context of lifelong learning. The Commission’s role in the process of promoting this key competence is to foster cooperation and mobility in international projects and networks. The new Lifelong Learning Programme provides financial support for respective activities.</p>
<p>Also the European Youth Pact foresees measures to enhance and support young people's entrepreneurial skills. Specific actions in the Youth in Action programme target young people to develop their spirit and sense of initiative, enterprise and creativity.</p>
<p>Delivering on the Commission Communication “Fostering entrepreneurial mindsets through education and learning”, the Conference on Entrepreneurship Education held in Oslo in October 2006 resulted in the “Oslo Agenda for Entrepreneurship Education” proposing new initiatives, like the creation of common platforms of programmes, projects and teaching material, in order to help dissemination of best practice. Cooperation between educational establishments and the local community and firms´ involvement in formal and non-formal education are other key issues. In addition, the Commission is exploring the feasibility of an Erasmus-type exchange programme for young and potential entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Regarding progress in Member States, the picture shows a varied mix. Last December the Commission's Annual Progress Report on the Lisbon Strategy highlighted that some Member States set up a national strategy for promoting entrepreneurship education at all levels (Cyprus, Spain, Finland, Slovenia, United Kingdom). Others have more generic plans in this sense (Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta). But so far entrepreneurship is well established in the curricula only in Finland, Ireland, Poland and United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Commission's services co-operate with relevant authorities in the Member States to encourage entrepreneurship and to ease the setting up of businesses. The Modern SME Policy represents a new stages in the Commission policy to support entrepreneurship. For instance, the recently Commission-established network of "national start-up co-ordinators" should keep facilitating start-ups high up in the EU´s political agenda. Moreover, the Commission is focussing on the promotion of entrepreneurship via the audio-visual media and preparing actions to tackle stigma attached to failure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0139"></a>

<p>(EN) According to the EC Treaty, social protection is the competence of the Member States. Therefore, the Commission does not interfere in the overall design of pension systems within EU. With respect to provision organised through contracts between employers and employees, the Commission has introduced legislation aimed at the good governance and sound management of these schemes. However it has no competence to intervene in the specific details of such arrangements.</p>
<p>This said, the Laeken European Council of December 2001 adopted broad common objectives for pension systems, towards which Member States should develop their reform strategies. These are: adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation. In order to ensure financial sustainability, policies should include measures to promote higher employment of older workers and not to encourage early retirement. Moreover, the European Union has set explicit targets for working longer in the context of the Lisbon strategy: to increase the employment rate of older workers (aged 55-64) to 50%and to increase the effective age of exit from the labour market by 5 years by 2010. Longer working lives result in more contribution years and fewer benefit years, thus contributing directly to the adequacy and sustainability of pension systems. Pension systems are an important part of labour market institutions through the provision of benefits. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the incentive structure embedded in the pension system is supportive to employment. In particular, attention still needs to be paid in a number of Member States to paths of early exit (before the standard retirement age) from the labour market.</p>
<p>Furthermore discriminating against workers on the grounds of age is covered within Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Directive prohibits unjustified forms of age discrimination in employment preventing disadvantaged age groups from participating fully in the labour market. The Directive prohibits direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and instructions to discriminate on grounds of age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief in relation to:</p>
<p>access to employment, self-employment and occupation</p>
<p>access to vocational training and guidance</p>
<p>employment and working conditions, including dismissals and pay</p>
<p>The Member States had until 2 December 2003 to transpose the requirements of the Directive into national law. With regard to age, the period of transposition could be extended by three years to 2 December 2006 for those Member States who needed the extra time in order to take account of particular conditions. Non-discrimination legislation is necessary to remove structural barriers to the employment of older people, and to ensure that they are not discriminated against in employment, for example in the provision of training. But not all differences of treatment will be unlawful, as they may be justified under national labour market policy and the attempt to increase the employment opportunities of older workers. According to Article 6 (2) of the Directive, Member States may provide that the fixing for occupational social security schemes of ages for admission or entitlement to retirement or invalidity benefits, including the fixing under those schemes of different ages for employees or groups or categories of employees, and the use, in the context of such schemes, of age criteria in actuarial calculations, does not constitute discrimination on the grounds of age, provided this does not result in discrimination on the grounds of sex.</p>
<p>Member States have agreed to work together in order to ensure the sustainability and adequacy of pensions across the EU. The Laeken European Council of December 2001 recognised that there could be significant benefits by enhancing dialogue and co-operation on issues related to the reform of pension systems. It endorsed a working method based on the open method of coordination. The latest report can be found at:</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The questions raised by the honourable Member refer to the launch of the ‘Youth in Action’ Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission was anxious to ensure that the Youth in Action Programme was launched effectively as soon as possible. In fact, from the application deadline date of 1 February 2007, hundreds of projects have been submitted for financing under the programme. From this point of view, the situation is distinctly more favourable than at the time of the launch of the previous programme in 2000.</p>
<p>That has been achieved in spite of the late adoption of the decision setting up the programme. It was adopted on 15 November 2006 and published in the Official Journal on 24 November and the basic instrument came into force on 14 December, the date on which the management priorities for 2007 could be decided after consultation with the programme’s Committee. These circumstances made it impossible to publish the programme guide very early in 2006, even if the Commission went ahead with this publication, subject to the adoption of the decision, before the programme effectively came into force.</p>
<p>The programme guide has been prepared in close consultation with the national agencies responsible for the implementation of the programme at national level and in consultation with other parties engaged in the programme. It did not seem desirable to refer to differences from the conditions for submission that applied under the previous programme, but rather to present a guide that was appropriate for the new programme. In this context, and in order to avoid any confusion, attention has not been drawn specifically to the differences between the two programmes in the programme guide. Various parties engaged in the programme, who act as information resources for the final beneficiaries, have, however, been made aware of these differences during the information sessions and have been able to pass on this information to potential beneficiaries who would have benefited from the previous programme.</p>
<p>The Commission has endeavoured to make the programme guide available to potential beneficiaries in all the Community languages as soon as possible, taking into account the time needed for drafting and translation of this document. This publication in all the languages was available on 17 January 2007, that is, two weeks before the first date for submitting requests for subsidy.</p>
<p>In spite of the late adoption of the decision setting up ‘Youth in Action’, the Commission wanted, in the interests of potential beneficiaries, proposals to be submitted by the first annual application deadline, which is 1 February. It is true that, considering the difficulties encountered (notably in the matter of translation), the wish to make the new programme available from the beginning of 2007, hence without any break in continuity with the programme that came to an end on 31 December 2006, gave rise to circumstances at the start that were sometimes less comfortable than if the start had been postponed. We should, however, note the following features of the ‘Youth in Action’ programme: the timetable for submission of projects under this programme, with five annual application deadlines, means that there is virtually a continuous call for proposals, a project that is not submitted for 1 February could be submitted for 1 April. Consequently, to offer applicants who were ready for the first date the possibility of submitting a project for 1 February was not prejudicial to other applicants. The Commission therefore considered that this approach was the one that offered the greatest flexibility to the beneficiaries of the programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0103"></a>

<p>(EN) Statistical legislation at EU level is very often concerned with output harmonisation, i.e. Member States are free to decide how to collect information. The Commission encourages Member States to do so while minimising the burden on respondents, e.g. through the use of administrative data. As a result, most of the very small enterprises are already excluded from statistical surveys. In some cases, a threshold is used in statistical Regulations to exclude small enterprises completely, e.g. there is a 20-employee threshold in the survey on industrial production (Prodcom) and in the annex on business services in the recast of the Structural Business Statistics.</p>
<p>To support Member States' endeavours to lower the burden on businesses, the Commission intends to launch a programme on the modernisation of enterprise and trade statistics (MEETS), through which support will be given to promote smarter ways of collecting data, such as (a) data linking, (b) estimations, (c) use of administrative data, (d) use of accounting data. The programme will run from 2008 to 2013.</p>
<p>As far as gold-plating is concerned, the Commission is aware of the fact that Member States' statistical surveys implementing EU legislation sometimes contain more questions than the EU legislation requires. In the context of the Better Regulation initiative<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission has already addressed this issue with Member States and will continue to make sure that any unnecessary burden is avoided.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that Article 29 of the 2006 Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement imposes a zero preferential tariff rate on imports of certain waste materials from the entry into force of the Agreement (which requires a 2/3rds senate approval in Philippines). However, Philippines currently has national legislation (Republic Act No. 6969) prohibiting the entry of hazardous waste onto its territory, even for purposes of transit, and imposing tough criminal penalties in case of violation of this law. Moreover, both Japan and the Philippines are Parties to the Basel Convention, which while not prohibiting hazardous waste exports altogether, regulates such shipments through a system of prior notification and consent. Parties to the Convention may not export to Parties which explicitly prohibit such imports. Both countries are also Parties to the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, but it is important to note that while this Convention covers certain chemicals and pesticides, waste is excluded from its scope.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of these Conventions depends on States Parties not merely having adequate legislation but also proper monitoring and enforcement capacity to prevent illegal shipments of such hazardous wastes from entering their territory. A number of developing countries have been advocating for many years for stricter provisions in relation to exports of hazardous wastes to developing countries.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Conference of the Parties unanimously adopted an amendment to the Basel Convention, which bans hazardous waste exports for final disposal and recovery from Basel Convention parties that are EU and/or OECD<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> members to any other Party of the Convention (the so-called "Ban Amendment"). The threshold of ratifications needed for the amendment to come into force has not yet been reached, and the EU actively encourages States that have not yet done so to ratify it. To date, neither Japan nor Philippines have ratified the amendment.</p>
<p>The EU has for its part already fully implemented the Ban Amendment through its Waste Shipment Regulation, and is committed to pursuing global harmonisation in the area of transboundary shipments of waste.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The action of the Community, however, would not be complete without an intervention specifically designed to strengthen economic and social links between the outermost regions (OR) and the third countries bordering on these European regions, in particular the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. These actions are included in the Action Plan for ‘Grand Voisinage’. This Action Plan is not a separate financial instrument but a Commission Initiative whose goal is to better coordinate the Community’s efforts in Community policy as a whole, especially cohesion policy, development policy and common trade policy, in order to better integrate the outermost regions into the geographical zone to which they belong.</p>
<p>Since the Commission’s Communication on the outermost regions in 2004<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of this action plan:</p>
<p>Concerning trade aspects, the Commission has made progress in the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements and has regularly kept the outermost regions informed. The Commission has also, on several occasions, called upon the outermost regions to communicate their interests in relation to the negotiations in order to be able to include them, especially in the last phase of negotiation relating to access to markets. At the moment, only Spain has communicated its interests, and they are currently in the process of being examined by the Commission.</p>
<p>As regards the implementation of regional cooperation programmes and their link with the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), significant progress has been achieved in terms of taking into account the theme of cooperation between ACP countries and the outermost regions in the programming of the European Development Fund (EDF) and the European territorial cooperation of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). In this way the work led by the Commission within the services and with Member States has resulted in progress towards programming that is better organised: the reservation of a financial envelope in the 10th EDF and the 2007/2013 ERDF allocated to this cooperation, common identification of priorities, indicative allocation of resources to this cooperation and joint preselection of projects, while respecting the mechanisms of programming, of management and of monitoring that are appropriate to each Fund.</p>
<p>In other Community policies, the Commission has likewise adopted proposals to support efforts towards regional integration of the outermost regions.</p>
<p>In the field of transport, the Commission has granted permission for aid to be given for the setting up of air transport services between the outermost regions and the neighbouring third countries. Furthermore, in its recent communication on the extension of trans- European transport networks to third countries, it proposes the inclusion of the outermost regions of the Iberian region in the extension of the motorways of the sea axis to the EU’s neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Concerning research and development, the Seventh Framework Programme stresses the importance of cooperation between ACP countries and the outermost regions for the development of international cooperation activities under this programme.</p>
<p>Similar actions have also been taken in the field of fisheries, in particular, the setting up of Fisheries Consultative Councils.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as the specific question on immigration is concerned, the Commission is very concerned about the ever-increasing number of migrants attempting to reach EU territory by unauthorised means and, indeed, at risk of their lives. The treatment of the question of immigration in the outermost regions must be balanced.</p>
<p>The fight against illegal immigration must be accompanied by measures to integrate legal migrants. Indeed, the fight against illegal immigration must not harm the free circulation of legitimate foreign nationals from neighbouring third states because this free circulation is necessary for the economic integration of the outermost regions into their geographical zone and reduces their dependency in relation to the mainland.</p>
<p>Emergency measures taken in order to deal with certain situations such as those implemented in the Canary Islands must be accompanied by development policy in the countries of origin. The EU’s financial resources within the context of its Development Policy (EDF) and its Cohesion Policy (Structural Funds) may be used for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On a recent visit to Djibouti, in recognition of Djibouti's contribution to regional stability and its role as a mediator, messenger and peace-maker, Commissioner Michel asked President Guelleh to step up political relations between Djibouti and the EU, which, among other things, is one the largest development aid donors. Although the Republic of Djibouti is of clear strategic importance in both regional and global terms, it has an authoritarian presidential regime. No more than a few days after the Commissioner's visit, a number of journalists and members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Renewal (MRD) were arbitrarily arrested, as reported by Reporters Without Borders, among others. The regime's treatment of opponents in Djibouti raises a number of questions, particularly in the light of the fact that parliamentary elections are to be held there in January 2008.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to go about ensuring long-term respect for human rights in Djibouti and, with this in mind, does it intend to organise – or to support the organisation of – a European election observation mission to the country in 2008?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission has followed closely the political situation in the country and in particular the arrests of several journalists and representatives of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Renewal (MRD). It has been pleased to learn that the people arrested have finally been acquitted, despite the fact that the Republic’s public prosecutor lodged an appeal against the decision to release Mr Houssein Ahmed Farah, journalist for Djibouti Renewal and brother of the president of the MRD.</p>
<p>As the Commmissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid has again stressed during his mission in the Horn of Africa, the Commission attaches particular importance to political dialogue as the framework within which issues as important as governance, right to opposition, reform and human rights should be discussed</p>
<p>Political dialogue between the Commission and the Djibouti authorities began in 2004. The country’s authorities participated actively and at the highest level in these meetings.</p>
<p>Despite the significant problems and challenges that remain, some progress has been made in the field of human rights and, more particularly, of social, economic and cultural rights. This is particularly marked in relation to the status of women, especially the efforts towards emancipation, education, information and advancement of women. Progress has been made in the field of the right to work, right to social security, right to health care, especially for AIDS and tuberculosis, and the right to participate in cultural life.</p>
<p>The Commission intends, of course, to pursue a constructive and frank political dialogue with the Djibouti authorities in order to support and encourage efforts regarding good political governance and human rights.</p>
<p>Concerning the organisation of a European observation mission for the legislative elections in 2008, this possibility could be explored as soon as the Djibouti Government requests it. The Commission, however, wishes to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the limited number of electoral observations that the EU can carry out in view of the resources available and the order of priority that it has to decide among the requests received.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0122"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission does not envisage financing directly or indirectly Phase II of the ‘Plan Colombia’, just as it did not finance its first phase.</p>
<p>The cooperation that will be financed in the coming years from the Community budget is set out in the draft Country Strategy Paper 2007-2013 which should be adopted by the Commission in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The draft makes provision for a financial envelope of EUR160 million and defines three sectors of priority intervention:</p>
<p>1) Peace and stability, including alternative development: 70% of the budget;</p>
<p>2) Rule of Law, justice and human rights: 20% of the budget;</p>
<p>3) Productivity, competitiveness and trade: 10% of the budget.</p>
<p>In the context of the search for greater social cohesion in this country in conflict, the intention under sector 1 is to consolidate and extend the strategy developed by the Peace Laboratories with greater attention given to alternative development actions. This sector will also include actions in favour of displaced persons.</p>
<p>Sector 2 of the CSP (Country Strategy Paper) aims to continue with the work carried out in strengthening the legal institution and to improve on it by including for the first time a share in direct cooperation with the State in the area of human rights.</p>
<p>In the context of a globalised economy the objective of sector 3 is to strengthen the competitiveness of the Colombian economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0130"></a>

The European Development Fund is predominantly focussed on least developed and low income countries and these countries have been the beneficiaries of around 70% of commitments made in the water and sanitation sector under the EDF.</p>
<p>The EC’s activities in the water and sanitation sector are taking place and being prepared as part of the Country Strategies and National and Regional Indicative Programmes. These documents are elaborated in consultation with the partner countries and reflect the partner country national priorities.</p>
<p>Under the 9<span class="sup">th </span>EDF, which operates for the period 2002 to 2007, approximately € 475 million was allocated to water and sanitation in 16 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. In addition, a further € 500 million has been made available through the ACP-EU Water Facility to focus on delivery and leveraging of investment in water and sanitation services. Programming for the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, which will operate for the period 2008 to 2013, is currently being completed and it is too early to quantify the overall level of allocations to water and sanitation. In addition, the EU-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure and its Trust Fund will support regional water programmes that contribute to sustainable economic growth, promote regional trade, foster regional integration and reduce poverty. The water component of the Partnership is intended to cover sustainable use of regional water resources and improved water resources management at river and groundwater basin, national and transboundary levels.</p>

<p>(EN) On the issue of Community assistance for the four prefectures of Epirus, the Commission would like to emphasise that the prefecture is not an administrative level which plays a role in the programming of Community support. Community assistance is programmed at national and regional level. Its allocation and implementation at lower administrative levels is the responsibility of the Member State, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. Therefore the Commission does not dispose of details on the programming or absorption of Community assistance at the level of Greek prefectures.</p>
<p>As concerns the Epirus region as a whole, it benefits first and foremost from the regional operational programme "Epirus", with a total budget of € 625 million, of which € 450 million in Community assistance. By mid February 2007, € 356 million in expenditure had been realised, which is equal to an absorption rate of 57%. This is close to the average absorption rate of 59% for Greece as a whole. As the Commission has stated at previous occasions, this level of absorption represents a clear improvement with respect to the situation of two-three years ago, for Greece as a whole and for Epirus. Nevertheless, a further significant acceleration of the implementation of co-financed projects is necessary to diminish the risk of loss of Community funds between now and the end of 2008.</p>
<p>The Epirus region also benefits substantially from Community assistance programmed at national level, for instance through the national operational programme for the highways. This programme currently co-finances important sections of the Egnatia highway in Epirus, which links the region to the rest of northern and eastern Greece. The programmes of the 2007-2013 period are planned to co-finance the Ionian highway, which will link the Epirus region to western and southern Greece, as well as a capacity increase of the airport at Ioannina.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Epirus benefits from Community assistance allocated under the Cohesion Fund. This Fund currently co-finances the extension of the port of Igoumenitsa, projects to construct or improve water and waste water treatment systems in Ioannina, Preveza, Igoumenitsa, Parga and Arta, as well as a project for solid waste management in various parts of the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0137"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not share or accept the view that autonomous tariff quotas can only be opened if there is no production either within the EU or within the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) or the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) countries. In fact the trigger for the opening or the increase of autonomous tariff quotas can be a serious supply problem for the European processing industry and/or the need to guarantee equal access to raw material for all Member States concerned.</p>
<p>As a matter of principle duty rates for canned tuna and tuna loins are established at the same level of 24%. Only in the particular case where tuna loins are destined for further processing does the autonomous tariff quota regime provide for a very limited quantity of tuna loins to be imported with a reduced duty rate of 6%. The scope of this measure is to make available supplementary raw material which can not be provided solely by Community catches and from GSP+ or ACP countries.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of the traditional suppliers of tuna loins for processing benefit from preferential regimes. Around 80% derive from GSP+ countries and around another 5% from ACP countries. Tuna loins from both of these blocs being imported into the EU at 0% duty. The autonomous tariff quota at 6% is therefore only applicable to 15% of the relevant imports. Since import data have shown a significant increase of prices in the course of the years 2004 to 2006, the Commission is not of the view that the opening of an autonomous tariff quota will have a negative effect on prices of tuna loins for processing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In June 2005 the Commission launched a sector inquiry in the field of retail banking services. The first interim report<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on payment cards was published on 12 April 2006. A second interim report<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> was published on 17 July 2006, discussing inter alia competition in current accounts and related services. After taking into account the findings of the two interim reports and comments from all stakeholders, on 31 January 2007 the Commission published a final report and assessed in a communication<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the appropriate actions that could be taken on the basis of the report’s findings.</p>
<p>The Sector Inquiry found that some aspects of cooperation among banks, including savings and cooperative banks, could reduce competition and deter market entry. However, this subject requires further information gathering and analysis before conclusions on the situations in particular Member States can be drawn.</p>
<p>The sector inquiry assessed the extent of product tying in the member states, and found tying to be more common in Greece than the EU average for most products.<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> For example, 69% of Greek banks (weighted average) tie current accounts to mortgages, well above the EU average of 39%. Nonetheless, seven other countries are shown to have an even higher incidence of this practice.</p>
<p>Finally, the sector inquiry found that the prices charged for making a non-cash payment in Greece are the highest in Europe. The Commission has already indicated this situation in several previous answers to questions of Members of the Parliament<a href="#defann_66_5" name="refann_66_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The evidence gathered by the sector inquiry shows an average price of € 10 per credit transfer, which is more than 10 times the average price in the Euro-area. At the same time, statistics show that Greece is the country with the lowest number of non-cash payments per capita. There is likely to be a link between the low usage of non-cash payment instruments, the very high prices paid by Greek consumers and the level of competition in the payment market.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to follow up these issues. As a first step, the Commission will discuss with the Greek competition authority how best to follow up the findings of the sectoral inquiry concerning Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Does the Commission share the view that the concession contract in question was concluded without any tender or competition procedure, in the absence of any transparency whatsoever, contrary to Chapter 3 on transport of the Accession Treaty of the Republic of Bulgaria, given that the Trakia motorway is going to be constructed with EU's financial resources, and with explicit and implicit state guarantees, and also contrary to the Lisbon Strategy with respect to the abolition of the toll system and the introduction of an electronic eurovignette system?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) As the honourable Member has pointed out, the concession for the Trakia motorway was awarded without any call for competition. Nevertheless, the matter in question arose prior to accession, and is therefore subject to national law only and occurred while Bulgarian law in this respect was still not in line with the acquis communautaire. This circumstance was pointed out by the Commission, which impressed upon the Bulgarian authorities how regrettable this was. The Commission’s action was, however, limited, above all because pre-accession funds were not at stake in the financing of the project.</p>
<p>This point was clearly established at an ad hoc bilateral technical meeting on 27 January 2005 as well as at the meeting of the Association Committee on 15 June 2005. A technical solution was agreed upon that was acceptable in terms of Community transport law and, in particular, for the application of measures relating to tolls and rights of use under Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 17 June 1999, in relation to the taxation of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures. In reply to the honourable Member’s specific question, compatibility with Community law imposes respect for certain principles in calculating toll charges and makes provision for interoperability of electronic systems for the collection of tolls. On the other hand, it does not insist upon tolls being put in place or removed or being replaced by electronic vignettes.</p>
<p>The legal qualification of the State guarantees for the project rest also in Article 65 of the European Association Agreement relating to competition and public aid. This question has been the subject of detailed discussions between the European Commission services and the Bulgarian Commission for the Protection of Competition, which ultimately ruled on 3 May 2005 that, subject to certain conditions, the concession contract awarded to Trakia Motorway JSC included no element of State aid.</p>
<p>Finally, this matter has revealed the necessity for a thorough reform of Bulgarian law in this respect to bring it into compliance with the acquis communautaire. To this end a new law on concessions (SG No. 36/2.05.2006) has been prepared with the help of the Commission services. It came into force on 1 July 2006 and will not allow a contract to be awarded under the conditions that the honourable Member has so deplored.</p>
<p>For reasons previously explained, it must be stressed that, with regard to the different problems presented by this project, the Commission has always intervened only in a consultative capacity.</p>
<p>In all cases, projects cofinanced by Structural Funds or by the Cohesion Fund since Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union are conditional upon respect for Community law and for all other applicable national legislation brought into compliance if necessary with Community law. The project in question is not financed by Structural Funds nor by the Cohesion Fund and the Bulgarian authorities did not submit the project for such financing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0152"></a>

These fears have caused concern among Polish strawberry producers and processors. On 18 February this year, a protest call was issued and an organising committee appointed.

<p>(EN) The Commission has a fundamental obligation to ensure that EC law is complied with by the Member States. Poland by its Act of Accession has accepted the basic rules of law governing the EU and its acquis communautaire. Poland – as any other Member State – is obliged therefore to conform to EC law. The Habitats and Birds Directives form an integral part of the EC environmental law and need to be complied with.</p>
<p>When a Member State breaches the law, the Commission reserves the right to take any action it considers appropriate and necessary in accordance with the powers granted to it under the EC Treaty. The Commission would welcome those actions undertaken by the Member States to ensure full compliance with EC law.</p>
<p>The Commission strongly supports the upgrading of infrastructure being part of the Trans-European Transport Network which comprises also road infrastructure in Poland, including along the Helsinki-Warsaw road corridor in the North-Eastern part of the country. The Commission believes however, that a sustainable approach must be achieved in order to find the right balance between the transport needs and the protection of precious natural heritage in conformity with the relevant EU legislation.</p>
<p>As regards the motorway project of Rospuda Valley, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Poland on 1 March 2007. Poland has one week to respond. The Commission will then need to evaluate that response.</p>
<p>At this stage, and until the Commission has received and evaluated the Polish response, it is thus premature to consider the subsequent course of action.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The judgment handed down by the Court of Justice on 23 November 2006 in the case of Lidl Italia has the effect of bringing about a deterioration in the situation of many retail traders who, with their SMEs, may in future be held liable for the accuracy of the compulsory information on labels, although in practice they cannot possibly check it. This could considerably increase the administrative burden involved in enforcing Community law. It also runs counter to the initiatives of DG Enterprise (Better Law-making, cutting red tape). The other consequences are the creation of barriers to trade and a reduction in consumer protection.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the problems arising from this judgment, and will it, in particular, take advantage of the revision of Directive 2000/13/EC<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which is currently under way to lay down exactly who is responsible for the inclusion and accuracy of the information which appears on the label of a prepackaged food product?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The ‘Lidl Italia’ case is about the question of traders’ liability in the food sector. The Court ruled that Directive 2000/13 does not prevent a national regulation from stipulating that responsibility for failing to respect the labelling obligations laid down in the said Directive rests with all operators in the food chain including distributors. In this case, it is Italian law that made provision for such a liability and fixed the system of penalties in the event of any infringement.</p>
<p>The Commission is examining the legal implications of this judgment in the context of the revision of labelling legislation.</p>
<p>In practice, as far as liability is concerned, one must not forget that interaction between producers, manufacturers and distributors is becoming more and more complex. Thus, for example, very often primary producers are tied to manufacturers and distributors by contractual obligations that require compliance with standards in relation to quality or safety.</p>
<p>More and more distributors are offering products prepared under their own brand and they play a key role in various stages of the design of the products.</p>
<p>This situation results in greater joint liability for the various operators throughout the food chain, which is in contrast with the individual responsibilities in the past.</p>
<p>In any case, the exercise that is under way with a view to revising Community legislation in relation to labelling will provide an opportunity to study this question and to evaluate the potential necessity for harmonisation at Community level in order to avoid the inherent drawbacks of divergence between national legislations with regard to liability.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In line with the new regulations for Cohesion Policy for 2007-2013, the Commission adopted on 4 August 2006 decisions establishing the list of eligible regions and fixing the annual breakdown by Member State of commitment appropriations for 2007-2013 for the three objectives of cohesion policy. In this context, the Commission also determined the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocations for the European Territorial Co-operation Objective (which will replace the INTERREG Community Initiative in 2007-2013) by Member State with separate amounts for cross-border and transnational co-operation. It is however for the Member States to decide on the allocations to the individual cross-border and transnational programmes in which they will be involved.</p>
<p>Ireland will participate in two cross-border programmes: one with Wales (allocation from the ERDF is EUR 53m) and one with Northern Ireland and Scotland (€ 192 million). Both Ireland and Northern Ireland will also be involved in the Northern Periphery (€ 35 million), Atlantic Space (€ 104 million) and North-West Europe (c. € 350 million) transnational co-operation programmes. In addition, the PEACE programme will operate within the framework of the territorial co-operation objective for the first time, with an allocation from the ERDF of € 225 million.</p>
<p>The Ireland-Wales programme was officially submitted to the Commission on 6 March 2007. The Commission is awaiting the formal submission of the other programmes mentioned in the spring of this year.</p>
<p>Given that no programme involving Ireland and Northern Ireland has yet been adopted, and only one has been formally presented, it is not possible to specify precisely how the funding will be used. However, by looking at the on-going public consultation exercise for the Ireland/Northern Ireland/Scotland programme, it is clear that the programme partners intend to focus their financing on issues such as regional co-operation for enterprise, tourism, co-operation for development and cross-border infrastructure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0170"></a>

<p>(EN) A number of studies have been carried out the over last few years on company taxation and the European economy. A few of the more relevant ones are mentioned below.</p>
<p>The Commission itself published a major study prepared by its staff, assisted by two panels of experts from academia and the business sector and social partners in 2001<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This study, inter alia, identified a number of tax obstacles to the efficient working of the Internal Market. As a result of these obstacles the costs of doing business and investing cross border within the EU are higher than for the equivalent national activities. This leads to less competitiveness in the EU. In order to promote investment, growth and employment the Commission subsequently concluded that the best way to remove these obstacles is to work towards the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB).</p>
<p>In 2004 a further study was published by the Commission on tax compliance costs<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which found that tax compliance costs arising from cross border operations are significantly above those arising from purely national operations. The provision of the CCCTB, reducing the number of potentially applicable national sets of tax rules from twenty seven to one, is expected to reduce these costs which currently have a damaging effect on the competitiveness of the European economy.</p>
<p>At the academic level, a number of studies on these issues have been carried out in recent years<a href="#defann_75_3" name="refann_75_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. These studies simulate the growth, employment and welfare effects of different tax coordination policies in the field of corporate taxation (normally within an applied general equilibrium framework). These studies show that the gains from increased coordination in the corporate tax field at the EU level, of which the CCCTB is an example, depend on the details of the policy. But in general, an overall welfare gain from 0.18% to 0.94% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated. No study has simulated so far the economic effects of the specific details of the CCCTB proposal based on assumptions such as its optionality for firms, consolidation together with an apportionment mechanism, no harmonization of tax rates, etc as the preparatory work is not yet completed. However the Commission will prepare a full Impact Assessment to accompany the legislative proposal which will cover these areas.</p>
<p>Whether a 'one fits all solution' would solve the structural difficulties of the European economy or not is open to debate. However, in the context of the question, which relates to the CCCTB, it is clear that the CCCTB is not a 'one fits all solution'. The Commission plans to propose this as an optional measure for companies, not a compulsory measure. More fundamentally, the CCCTB concerns only the tax base. The tax rate would remain a matter for individual Member States. The Commission consistently and carefully avoids promoting a 'one fits all solution' as regards company taxation as is further illustrated in the recent Coordination Communications<a href="#defann_75_4" name="refann_75_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

With a view to boosting the role and profits of the monopoly concerns which operate in the pensions, health and welfare sectors and on the pretext of the ageing of the population and the viability of pension schemes, it is proposed to extend flexible forms of employment, worsen social security, raise the retirement age, and drastically reduce pensions in the health and welfare sector. Workers and pensioners are radically opposed to these options.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that raising the retirement age and further privatisation of the pensions, health and welfare sectors improve workers' standard of living? In the Commission's view, what steps should be taken to ensure that pensions and, more generally, social benefits enable all pensioners to lead a dignified life?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The European Union is committed to modernising the European social model based on the shared values of social justice and active participation of all citizens in economic and social life.</p>
<p>The Council adopted the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion on 22 February 2007 on the basis of the Commission Communication<a href="#defann_76_1" name="refann_76_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The report summarises the conclusions of the first round of the streamlined open method of coordination, covering social inclusion, pensions, healthcare and long term care. As mentioned in the report, a detailed analysis of pension provision was carried out in the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion of 2006 and its annexes<a href="#defann_76_2" name="refann_76_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The 2006 report underlines that there has been a sharp increase in life expectancy over the last 40 years (an increase of 4 years between 1960 and 2000, and a further increase of 4 years projected until 2050) coupled with earlier exits from the labour market (average exit age is currently below its level in the late 1960s). As a result, the number of years of contributions to social security systems has decreased whilst the years spent in retirement and in receipt of old age benefits have increased, placing increased pressure on the financing of pension systems.</p>
<p>Member States have recently undertaken significant reforms of their pension systems to respond to the consequences of an ageing population and of the baby-boomer generation reaching retirement. These reforms aim to ensure the financial sustainability of social security systems. The Commission is of the opinion that such reforms should not undermine the provision of decent income for retired people. According to the Commission, the most effective way of ensuring both the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems is to ensure that more people are in work and that they work longer. As part of the Lisbon Strategy, the Union has set the objective of increasing the employment rate of older workers (55-64) to 50% and of increasing by 5 years the effective age of exit from the labour. Pension systems should therefore support employment and discourage early retirement. Similarly, it is essential to open up employment opportunities for older workers through appropriate labour market reforms.</p>
<p>The 2006 report also underlines that the public pay-as-you-go pension schemes are expected to remain the main source of income for pensioners. The trend towards a broader use of privately managed pension provision does not mean that the State should withdraw from this area. Public authorities should play a key-role in monitoring and regulating private pension provision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) provides for the granting of compensation to fishermen and owners of vessels for temporary cessation of activities, under specific circumstances.</p>
<p>The Member States can grant aid, with Community co-financing, in the event of non-foreseeable circumstances, particularly those caused by biological factors. The management authority has to provide in advance to the Commission the scientific basis of its proposal.</p>
<p>In this case, the maximum duration for granting the allowance is six months over the whole of the period 2000-2006. Also for each Member State, the ceiling for the Community financial contribution from the FIFG to these compensation measures, for the entire period from 2000 to 2006, is € one million or 4% of the Community financial assistance allocated to the sector in the Member State concerned. The Community financial contribution may not exceed the higher of these two amounts.</p>
<p>For the 2007-2013 period for which a new Portuguese operational programme will be adopted during the year 2007, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) provides for the financing of aid measures for the temporary cessation of fishing activities for fishers and owners of vessels, but this has mainly to be within the context of fishing effort adjustment plans. The Portuguese authorities responsible for the management of the sector must guarantee compliance with the provisions of the EFF Regulation before granting assistance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
