<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, honourable Members, the first message I would like to deliver today is that the Commission is listening to citizens. We want to base our actions on and deliver on their expectations and concerns. Listening is at the very heart of Plan D. The Commission has implemented a series of activities to stimulate the debate in all Member States and has given support to those countries which requested it.</p>
<p class="contents">We can draw some important lessons from the national debates, which are fully supported by the Eurobarometer surveys. Firstly, citizens are concerned about the high rate of unemployment and the negative effects of globalisation. This is no surprise to most of us. Social protection is at the very core of the debates and the request for comparable living standards is high almost everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is the second predominant issue. More and more citizens question, if not the principle itself, the scope and pace of future accessions. We need to show that enlargement does not happen by default and why it is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The third lesson we can draw is that Europeans want more not less Europe. But they want to see results and to be more involved in the policy process. They perceive the Union as an entity that can protect them. They are asking for more security, as well a higher level of environmental protection, food safety and a more stable energy supply. The Commission intends to respond to these concerns. That is why we have adopted a citizens’ agenda for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not suggesting a completely new strategy. Our work remains rooted in the three building stones of prosperity, solidarity and security, with a continued emphasis on jobs and growth, in line with the Lisbon Strategy. We are, however, focusing to a greater extent on citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we propose? Deeper economic integration should go hand in hand with solidarity. Europe is not just a marketplace; it also has a social dimension. Next year, we will therefore launch an agenda for access and solidarity. We have also discussed the idea of an ‘entitlement card’, to facilitate citizens’ full access to their rights and to make these rights more visible. We will also continue to implement the sustainable development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we will launch a comprehensive review of the single market, to be completed next year. The single market has brought huge benefits for citizens, but it is still unfinished business in the areas of energy, banking charges and roaming fees, for instance. We need to remove the remaining barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">European Citizens rightly expect Europe to be a fair and safe place to live in. But Europe is not always capable of combating terrorism and organised crime. The existing decision-making tools create undue delays and, even more regrettably, do not ensure proper democratic scrutiny. The Commission proposes improving the decision-making process in these areas. We can do that by using the provisions of the current treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Before addressing the institutional questions, I would like to mention two more areas where further action is proposed. While honouring our commitments on enlargement, we must not lose broad public support for this important part of the EU project. The Commission will take forward the debate on enlargement and its added value, and this will be part of the Commission’s enlargement strategy report, to be submitted in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission is willing to improve the coherence and efficiency of the European Union’s action in the international arena. We will present concrete proposals next week.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of our actions, our commitment to subsidiarity, openness and transparency, as well as our efforts towards better regulation, will be vigorously pursued. We will seek to involve national parliaments more in the process of policy formulation. However, the Commission’s main interlocutor remains the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the institutional issues. Five countries that had not ratified the Constitution before the start of the period of reflection have now done so. Furthermore, Estonia’s Parliament voted in favour of the Constitution on 9 May, which brings the number of countries to have ratified to 15. We are pleased that Finland, which will hold the incoming Presidency, is also planning to ratify the Constitution. We welcome the new ratifications. They show that Member States are attached to the principles and values of the Constitution. We have to listen to the views and the positions of the countries which said ‘no’, but it is equally important to listen to the voices of those who say ‘yes’.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that there is no misunderstanding among us on the following point. The Commission continues to endorse the principles and improvements the Constitution would bring. The Constitution would definitely make the Union more effective, more open and more democratic. This is natural for a Constitution where parliamentarians were the majority voice. Of course we would like to see the Constitutional Treaty ratified in all 25 Member States. We stand with Parliament on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Many options have been floated on how to overcome the current deadlock. Many ideas are being discussed. Yet no consensus exists on the way forward. Is the time ripe for a solution to be presented? To use wording that is familiar to us, is it now time to work on the text or still time to work on the context?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to rebuild a climate of confidence and trust. We need to reconnect with citizens and prove, with firm results, that the Union can address citizens’ needs and aspirations. Let me be clear: delivering results for citizens through key policies is not an alternative to tackling the institutional issues. It is part of a twin-track approach, where progress on one track makes it easier to move ahead on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose that, next year, the three institutions should jointly adopt a declaration. This should serve as a basis for European Council decisions on a process leading to a future comprehensive institutional settlement. I see the declaration as firm proof of Member States’, Parliament’s and the Commission’s firm will to solve the constitutional deadlock. I expect the European Parliament to play an important role here. Like you, I hope that together we can achieve a constitutional settlement by the 2009 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The listening exercise proved to be successful and should continue. Plan D was not a one-off operation. I have promised the Commission that after the June Summit I will address what our next steps should be – if you wish, the second phase of Plan D.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens’ agenda will demonstrate the added value of the Union and thus help to restore citizens’ confidence. It is by reconnecting with citizens that we can create the conditions for a future comprehensive institutional settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking forward to the debate with you today, I would like to thank the political group chairmen for their contribution to the Commission’s policy formulation.</p>

We therefore encourage you to keep going.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that we were going to move on to the second phase of Plan D; the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to make a proposal to you: we are no longer calling it a discussion, because a discussion that lasts for too long can give the impression that we are having a rest and not doing much more; let us call it an analysis, because I think that what follows an analysis is a proposal, which is what you are referring to with the joint declaration by the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this joint declaration by the three institutions is a good idea, Mrs Wallström, firstly because it marks the symbolic anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which were the starting point for the Community, but also because it means that the Council, the Commission and Parliament want to put forward proposals together for a way out of the situation of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">You can therefore count on the European Parliament for this institutional declaration, but this means that we want to take part in drawing it up, not just sign it at the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the fact that the process of ratifying the Constitution continued in Estonia and that the Finnish Parliament decided to ratify it is good news, which proves that all those who are prophesying that the Constitution is dead are wrong. No one ratifies something that is dead.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the task that we have at the moment – and when I say task, I know that what I am asking is not simple – is to convince European citizens of what we could call ‘the cost of non Constitution’.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember many years ago, when the Single European Act was being debated, there was a report called ‘The cost of non Europe’, in other words, what it would cost people if the Single European Act did not come into force and the internal common market was not created.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we need to do in this debate on the Constitutional Treaty is something similar: to explain to people, with examples, what would be lacking in their lives if there were no European Constitution. I am certain that this is a good task for the second phase of analysis, because it could produce proposals that will ultimately help to achieve what all of us, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, want: for Europe to add value for people, for Europe to defend our common values and for Europe, ultimately, to make people’s lives more effective, fairer, freer and better supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are one of the really prominent people in the Commission who are speaking up not only for Plan D but also for the democratisation of Europe as a whole and for greater effectiveness in the Commission's activities. You are – and I say this on behalf of our group – one of the personalities who can be described as an asset for progress in Europe. Your speech once again made it clear that you, as the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for Plan D, are someone in whom we can trust and on whom we can rely.</p>
<p class="contents">What recognisable results have so far come out of this period of reflection, which, as Mr Méndez de Vigo said, is continually threatening to degenerate into a siesta?</p>
<p class="contents">What the citizens of Europe want is more transparency. They want a better understanding of what happens in the institutions. They want a clearer division of competences: who does what, where, when and on what legal basis? They want greater effectiveness in legislation and administration. They want the subsidiarity principle to be strengthened. Not everything has to be done in Brussels – some things can be done at home. Not everything, though, can be solved at home, and those things should be regulated by Brussels. That is a clear message. The people therefore also want the EU to have a stronger presence in international politics. They want the EU to be effective in fighting crime. We know all of that, and it is up to us, the Council and the Commission to achieve it. It is all in the Constitution, though. We all know that we need the Constitution if we are to meet these demands from the public. At the end of the period of reflection, it is now clearer than ever that it is not possible to meet the demands of the public on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. It was not possible with 15 Member States – which is why Nice needed to be amended and replaced by the Constitution – and we will soon have 27 Member States and still do not have the Constitution. How can it be possible now? The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Without a shadow of a doubt, nobody should be fighting harder for the Constitution than the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to thank you, Mrs Wallström, but I would also say one thing quite clearly to the President of the Commission: How can you go into an interparliamentary conference like the one last week, where the overwhelming majority of the national and European parliamentarians present spoke out in favour of the Constitution and the next President-in-Office of the Council Mr Vanhanen declared that, during his Presidency, Finland would symbolically ratify the Constitution, and then, as President of the Commission, raise doubts – and these doubts do exist – as to whether you yourself are prepared to say to the Heads of State or Government: if you do not join with me in implementing the Constitution, the expanded Europe will grind to a halt? I will give you an example: 25 ministers of labour, and representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament, were present at the last informal Council meeting in Luxembourg, at which the Services Directive was discussed. After the initial two and a half hour long debate, each minister could speak for three minutes. That is a long time in comparison with the European Parliament, but was out of all proportion to the matter on the agenda. Europe cannot make any sensible policies in an elephantine body like the Ecofin: it is quite the opposite of good management, clear legislation and efficiency. We are reaching the limits of the current structures. If we want to make Europe more democratic, more transparent, more efficient – if we want to deliver to the people – we need to act, not talk. That is why we need the Constitution. As long as the Bureau of the Commission, and in particular the President, is sending messages that raise doubts about whether that institution is really determined to implement the Constitution, the opponents of the Constitution could well believe that we have given up. No, those who support the Constitution are behind you, Mrs Wallström, and they are in the majority. There are those in this Parliament who oppose the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those people now raising their voices are in a minority. The overwhelming majority of this House are in favour of the Constitution. The overwhelming majority of the Member States are in favour of the Constitution. The overwhelming majority of the Commission are in favour of the Constitution. We therefore all have opportunities, so let us fight together, and that goes for Mr Barroso too.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marielle De Sarnez,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Europe is undergoing a serious crisis, probably the most serious in its history. We see it every day – Europe is not moving forward, or even standing still, but going backwards, and at the same time national egos are growing and the feeling of sharing a common destiny is in retreat.</p>
<p class="contents">Ahead of the next European Council, you have put forward a number of proposals in an attempt to respond to this crisis. Our group has taken note of a few timid steps forward among those proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, you are going to send all of your legislative proposals directly to the national parliaments at the same time as you send them to the European Parliament; that is good, but it does not change anything.</p>
<p class="contents">You are going to propose to the Member States a reform of the decision-making process in the field of judicial and police cooperation. That is better, but did it really need to take a year to come up with it? Do you really think that these proposals are going to recreate a climate of trust between the citizens and Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Your revival plan, be it in the field of policy or of the institutions, is not up to the challenges with which we are faced. You seem to be happy with taking very small steps, but what we need is a giant leap forward.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, your Europe of results is singularly lacking in ambition when it comes to policy. I should have liked to have heard you advocating new common policies, which are vital in order to prepare better for the future. This is particularly true when it comes to research, where we are losing ground all the time, to the United States and Japan today, and to China and India tomorrow. It is also true with regard to energy: it is clear that the issue of energy and energy supplies will be one of the major challenges of this century.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of immigration is also relevant. We need a common policy in this field, because it is clear that issues of migration and co-development need to be dealt with at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we should have like to have heard some proposals on the issue of economic governance. If we want to generate growth, and therefore employment, we obviously need to strengthen our economic, budgetary and industrial coordination, at least within the Eurozone. This really is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of proposals from you regarding the institutions is, in my opinion, even more serious. With regard to the basic issue of the future of our institutions, and therefore of our democracy, you contented yourself with commenting that there is currently no consensus between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström, the Commission's role is not just to make observations, but to present proposals. It was incumbent on the Commission to define a path, and to defend and carry a vision, and you have failed in that.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop lying to ourselves. Even though the ratification process is continuing symbolically, we all know that this Constitution will never see the light of day. We need to rewrite the Constitution, to produce a new text that is shorter, simpler, more readable and more tightly focused on the major principles on which the European Union is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">This text should say who we are, what we want and what values we espouse and defend. If we want to be in a position to ratify a political project of that nature in 2009, when European elections will be held in all the Member States, we must start preparing for it right now.</p>
<p class="contents">Those, Commissioner, are the regrets of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, Mr Barroso quite rightly called on the Heads of State or Government to take responsibility for the European project before their citizens. Today, we call on the Commission to revive the inspiration without which nothing much can ever be achieved.</p>

It rather looks as if you are in that position today, and you do not deserve it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the President of the Commission should hear the verdict of this House on his role in the constitutional process, and I hope you will ensure that he does so. He has played a quite disastrous role: cowardly, unimaginative, contradictory and deeply counterproductive. Perhaps he applied for a job as the grave-digger for the European Constitution; he certainly has every chance of getting it. I know that the President of the Commission is a master of misunderstanding: we have certainly always misunderstood him. One can hardly quote him without him claiming the exact opposite in the same speech, and whenever one tries to pin him down he claims to have meant something quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, however, the whole of Europe has understood the same message from this master of misunderstanding: no chance. Nothing will happen for years. Nice? Oh, it was not as bad as all that! As he said, the world will keep on turning without the Constitution. And the worst thing is that the citizens still expect results, not rhetoric. That is yet another misunderstanding, of course, but the citizens have understood perfectly well.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the start of his time in office, the President of the Commission has not made the slightest effort to find a solution to this constitutional conflict. At no point has he acted as an advocate for the European Constitution. For him, it is a glass bead game for political elites, institutional European navel-gazing – a phrase from Mr Blair, variations of which he continually drops in.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we will not make any progress this way. Parliament has adopted a decision. Right from the start there was a lack of support from the Commission, and there have been some significant misunderstandings. Nice may well allow some steps towards integration, Commissioner: we know that there are 'bridges'. There are possibilities for silent, almost discreet integration, but is that really what you want? Without a Charter of Fundamental Rights? Without the comprehensive democratisation of the EU? With no capacity to take action? Without the 'pedal to the metal' of unanimity in many areas? Do you really want it without social rights? Do you want it without a constitution to create the political environment in which the interests of the people of Europe can be better taken into account? Greater legitimacy, introducing more representation into decisions, more transparency and openness to the citizens, greater accountability to the citizens, more checks and balances, more parliamentary and judicial controls: that is what the constitution contains! It is not just formulas or pure rhetoric, as the President of the Commission keeps trying to suggest in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">You say he is listening to the people. I was very surprised by the Eurobarometer surveys following the referendums in France and the Netherlands, which clearly showed that more than two thirds of those who had voted 'no' were in favour of improving the constitution, and that they wanted those improvements to aim for a social Europe. In other words, this conflict is about a European democracy and the social dimension of Europe as a response to globalisation. And what is Mr Barroso doing? He is listening to the people and hearing something completely different. He is increasingly becoming the advocate of a Europe of governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux and the cause of the crisis is the Europe of governments. Did he not understand that the people were protesting against the democratic deficit, against the lack of transparency? Did he not listen? They did not mention terrorism. Yes, the Austrian Presidency is talking about subsidiarity and bureaucracy and the Court of Justice, but the citizens are not. While the governments are clinging on to their claims to power, the citizens want a European democracy, they want a social dimension, they want their basic rights, and they want a better constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the President of the Commission’s historical responsibility to initiate and support this improvement process, and he would be well advised to assume it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people do not just want to understand better what is going on in the institutions – they want greater participation. They want to be asked what they want, they want to make decisions, they want to be involved in the discussions on the future of Europe, and they want that to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have a rather different conception of the term 'listening' of which Mr Barroso is so fond. Precisely in this respect we need to make changes, so that we can ultimately have a real discussion on the future of the European Union. On his scores of trips, the President should not have just preached, but actually listened. All of those involved could have heard, from many people, quite specific conceptions of what the European Union should look like in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days after the European Social Forum in Athens, the European Commission held a press conference to present their initiative for a Citizens' Agenda. However, if you expected any reference to the discussions during the European Social Forum, in which 35 000 people participated, you would have been disappointed. The members of my group take this forum seriously, though, and both before and during the forum they were involved in the discussions regarding a European appeal – Europe gives the citizens their say – and regarding the Charter of Principles for a Different Europe. This refutes all those insinuations that the Left within the European Union is not prepared to join in discussions on the future of the EU or on the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the ideas used as starting points in both papers. We need to have a truly democratic debate on the future of Europe and the path we are going to take, and this debate must be based on the assumption that the dignity of every person must be sacrosanct and must be respected and protected. In my opinion, it is therefore quite grotesque for the President of the European Commission to state, as he did on 10 May 2006, that we must deliver results for Europe through a citizens' agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we adopted our proposal for a citizens' agenda; the communication proposes 11 initiatives relating primarily to the internal market. President Barroso is remaining particularly loyal to that topic. He is sticking by his basic conviction that the objective of the European Union must be to remain competitive as a whole in the global market. However, that will never result in a true social Europe of solidarity with social cohesion at the forefront, and that is what the citizens of Europe are so critical about. That is the path they do not want to be taken down. They want different priorities to be set, and I think it is time for this to be taken into account. That is what we need to discuss within the European Union, in the context of the constitutional process and the discussion on Plan D. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What a sad, inward-looking, almost ostrich-like speech that was from Commissioner Wallström. I can only conclude that Plan D stands for ‘delusional’. You really ought to get out more, because it seems to me that you are surrounded by Commissioners, officials, sycophants and parliamentarians here, who clearly do not represent the view of at least half the citizens of Europe. Mr Barroso himself is no better, because when he is not working in the Commission he is off on luxury yachts, holidaying with the super-rich.</p>
<p class="contents">I think perhaps I have a remedy for you. I should like to invite you, Commissioner Wallström, to come to my local pub one Sunday lunchtime and meet some real people. I can do even better than that: I could invite you to the Oval to watch a test match. Come and watch some cricket and, again, meet some real people! If you do not have time for any of that, you could read your own Eurobarometer poll, which shows that less than half the citizens of Europe now think that the European Union is doing a good job. You are ignoring all these things; in fact, you are developing a bunker mentality, and perhaps that is a good thing, because at least it shows that the end is in sight!</p>

Instead, you have all conspired against the French and Dutch people; you have conspired against your own rules, when you said here that it would have to be unanimous, and you are pressing on with this crazy project.

<p class="contents">If I am to be honest, Plan D seems to have more to do with a democratic deficit than with democracy, and more to do with a lack of dialogue than with dialogue. There is superficial discussion rather than real debate. The European Commission, which emphasises that Plan D is not an operation to save the European Constitution, reminds me of the Soviet agency TASS, which always denied that disasters occurred in the Soviet Union or that poverty existed.</p>
<p class="contents">What you are doing, in fact, is comparing apparent actions so as to ride out the storm for a while and hold out until the Constitution is accepted, almost certainly in an unadulterated form, in just a few years. If the Commission really and truly wanted to introduce a real Plan D, its first decision would be to call for constitutional referenda in the countries where the European Constitution was adopted by parliamentary decree, frequently by acclamation. Only four out of a dozen or so countries have so far held referenda. Two of these countries ratified the Constitution, whereas two rejected it. This reflects the real debate taking place in society and the lack of a real debate within the structures of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let the European Commission finally stop resembling a Chinese opera chorus, which sings ‘Let us flee, let us flee’ for three whole acts, but does not budge an inch.

Even if I do not agree with all the proposed solutions, in particular I welcome the commitment to a comprehensive review of the single market. I hope that this review will be heavily accentuated towards the opening of markets, liberalisation and tearing down economic barriers that still exist in Europe. I know that the President of the Commission is personally committed – as I am – to economic reform and liberalisation as the only way of ensuring growth and greater prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, welcome the proposed agenda in the field of justice and home affairs. It is true that people in Europe want to see greater cooperation between Member States to combat and defeat the threats we all face in the modern world – particularly terrorism – but I want to see more intergovernmental coordination in tackling crime and terrorism, rather than trying to make such issues the subject of qualified majority voting. They are matters that go to the very heart of the nation state and its responsibilities to its citizens in each case. The national veto should remain in those areas. The British Government is currently playing with fire in its ambivalence on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, I urge the Commission to concentrate on delivering the economic reform agenda. People in Europe want action; they want action on growth and they want action on jobs. There is no appetite for endless debate on Constitutional, institutional structures. They do not want grand projects that erode the sovereignty of their nations or affect their chances of getting a job. So my message to the leaders for the June summit has to be simple: they should focus on people’s priorities, particularly the plight of the 18 million who have no job in the Union. There is nothing for them in the current European Constitution. Europe needs to demonstrate clearly and unambiguously that it has learned some lessons from the votes on that. It needs to show that it is ready to move on to an ambitious reform programme that tackles those very issues that I referred to of low growth, high unemployment and threats to our environment. The social model needs to be reformed drastically. How can one speak of a social model that consigns so many to the misery of joblessness?</p>
<p class="contents">My opposition to the Constitution currently is not based on dogma, but it is known – as far as I am aware – that it would not be good for the people of Europe. I believe that is what the people of Europe have said, particularly in France and the Netherlands. The time has now come for the governments of Europe to wake up. We need reform. We need to be accountable, more transparent, and we need to reform priorities. We need to respond to the wishes and needs of the citizens, which was what we were charged to do at Laeken and where we have, unfortunately, currently failed the test. As we move forwards to an EU of 27, let us celebrate the diversity of the modern European Union; let us harness that diversity to work together for a true Europe of nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what you said today about the Constitution is not in the papers. I am talking in particular about the citizens' agenda. I therefore share the criticisms made by Mr Schulz and many others that, reading these papers, one gets the impression that the Commission has given up on fighting for the Constitution. I think that is a great shame, because you have severely disappointed not only many citizens who have also fought for the Constitution – for example in the referendums. That really is worthy of criticism. There are two major deficits to which you barely refer in this paper. The first is the institutional deficit: this could be dealt with through the Constitution, and I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo that the costs of not having the Constitution have not been stated. The second deficit relates to the lack of financial resources. That, too, has barely been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my main problem. I agree with you, Mrs Wallström, that it is absolutely vital not just to wait and to fight for the Constitution and for better funding, but also to take action now. I am referring in particular to the problem of unemployment. You have said some very pretty things here, with which I can agree, but where are the concrete proposals in addition to what we have discussed in the past with respect to Lisbon and so on? Where are the concrete proposals regarding, for example, coordination in economic policy, which is absolutely vital, especially in the euro area but also outside it, in order to create better economic conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission has agreed to make an effort to ensure that public investment in infrastructure is better coordinated, because we do not have enough money to fund everything from Europe and much will have to be funded at national level. None of this is in the papers, though. If I may turn to energy policy, we have discussed the fact that, independent of the Constitution – which also gave Europe more competences in energy policy – we need to take some significant steps, particularly with regard to infrastructure. None of this is set out specifically in the papers on the table. It is a similar case for foreign and security policy, in which it can be said, on the one hand, that we need to go as far as we can without Constitution, but also that it is very important to have a Constitution so that we can go still further.</p>
<p class="contents">You call for a European response to globalisation, but in this respect too there are far too few indications of what this European response could look like, in order to develop a European social model whilst at the same time pushing forward with modernisation and keeping up with the competition. That, too, is a citizens' agenda, and it is precisely what many of the citizens expect from us. Therefore, I would ask you once again to clarify the Commission's attitude towards the Constitution. We must not just stand still; I am absolutely in favour of taking appropriate steps in parallel with that. However, do not neglect the institutional conditions, because you will disappoint the citizens if you do not clearly say to them that a Constitution is also necessary so that their interests can be implemented globally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lively debate that was to be launched in all the Member States and that all the prime ministers promised at their summit on 18 June of last year has mainly been conspicuous by its absence. The Presidency clearly does not think it worth taking part in this debate, either.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not because people do not want to talk about Europe. You know, as I do and as do all of us, that people want to debate Europe. In schools, at workplaces and in debates, people everywhere are committed to discussing the issue and have views and ideas about what our European cooperation should consist in, about how it can be changed and improved and about what it should not include. What is missing is leadership. European leaders are too absorbed in their internal problems to be able to raise their sights to European level. Now it is time, however, to pull ourselves together and show the required leadership. If the prime ministers and foreign ministers do not wish to show leadership, then we ourselves must do so.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain amount needs, of course, to be done in the institutional sphere. A number of your proposals are extremely constructive. I believe that, if more transparency is introduced in the Council and greater scrutiny exercised and if the way in which subsidiarity is applied begins to be monitored – all things that can happen without a change to the Treaty – then that would be a step forward. We have high expectations of the Finnish Presidency. On this issue, the light appears to come from the east.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, need a Constitution in the sense of a set of regulations providing legitimacy. I too believe that, in the end, there will be a revised Constitution different from that which we have at present, but it should ideally be founded on the same basic ideas. We need to be proactive and committed in foreign policy and the fight against crime and to stand up for enlargement. I hope that we can produce practical proposals within the very near future. We all know that the period of reflection will be extended. We must show that the EU is needed for the sake of jobs and the economy and in order to bring about continued internal market reforms. We must show that the EU is needed in the world and we must point out the advantages of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the matters debated a lot in Europe and featuring among the top subjects on the Commission’s web site are institutional issues and the issue of Parliament’s seat. A huge number of people throughout Europe find it bizarre that the European Parliament meets in two locations. It costs a lot of money for it to do so and gives Parliament an air of the ridiculous. I do hope that this citizen initiative will soon land on Mrs Wallström’s desk with a million signatures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s contribution to the European Council of June 2006, which is the topic of this morning’s debate, offers little in the way of analysis, unfortunately. I would like to make one observation and three recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows from internal reports, one of the main reasons for the Dutch ‘no’ was the loss of sovereignty. It is perplexing that the Commission should subsequently attempt, through the back door, to extend the European Union’s powers in the areas of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all in favour of extending this period of reflection, provided that time is actually spent on reflecting on Europe’s future. We must move away from the text of the constitution, and a reorganisation of existing treaties must lead to a user-friendly institutional framework. This framework – call it a basic treaty if you like – must put concrete policy before the setting up of new institutions, such as an EU foreign affairs minister. This course of action will ultimately benefit the citizen more than a meaningless signature by a prime minister of the kind suggested by Mr Barroso in a declaration of loyalty. This will really not help us any further and will not impress the Dutch voter – something which my Dutch fellow Members do not need to be told. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alexander Stubb (PPE-DE). –</span></span>   Mr President, I have three points. Firstly, I agree with Mr Kirkhope that the Constitution is alive and kicking and we should be happy about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week was great: we had the Interparliamentary Forum, the Commission produced a paper, Estonia ratified the Constitution, Finland gave a clear signal that it would ratify and Mrs Merkel gave a great speech. Mr Farage is no longer here, but it was interesting to see that his message to the ‘cricket people’ was that he wants France and the Netherlands to decide for everyone else how the Constitution should be dealt with. It is an interesting message to give to the British people.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, echoing what Mr Méndez de Vigo said, is that we have five phases in this debate. The first phase was reflection, not siesta, as some would have liked to say. Now we are moving to the second phase, which is analysis. The Austrian Presidency needs to move the reflection phase on into a period of analysis and take on board Mr Méndez de Vigo’s excellent idea that there should be a study on the cost of not having a Constitution. Thirdly there will be a proposal phase and, fourthly, a negotiation phase. Finally, much like the Commissioner said, we will hopefully have a ratification phase in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the blame game. It seems to me, from listening to Parliament’s debate and the public debate, that we are playing a blame game. It appears that the Member States are blaming the European Parliament and the Commission for everything that goes wrong. The Commission has a tendency to blame the Member States, and the European Parliament blames both the Commission and the Member States. We need to get out of this blame game and start looking at this more as a team. The idea of a joint declaration, in which the European Parliament also participates, is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just point out that we are talking about the future of the Union, in preparation for the European Council, and only one group leader is present in this Chamber: Mr Poettering. Mr Schulz is no longer here, but he mentioned meetings of the Council of Ministers, in which each of the 25 Member States is given three minutes to speak, which makes a total of 75 minutes. If you take that example and apply it to our Chamber, with two minutes for each of the 732 MEPS, the total is 1 464 minutes. The debates in the Council are not necessarily sexy, but we could also make improvements in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is directed at the Commissioner. You have just said that it is great that some Member States are ratifying the Treaty. Five have done so since the negative referendum results and a sixth ratification is on its way. I urge you to tell your Prime Minister, Mr Persson, that it would be great if Sweden ratified it as well. This is not a statement in view of the Ice Hockey World Championship. It is a simple statement that Sweden should do it too.</p>

In fact, the discussion on the EU’s course and policy will be a permanent fixture. The Commission is right to point out that Plan D is not just linked to the debate about the constitutional treaty, however important that may be. It is a first exercise in more open, more pro-active European communication. More and more communication is an essential pre-condition for successful European cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Commission presented the first results of operation ‘Plan D’, which I welcome with open arms. The Commission clearly indicates the concrete action that has been taken, which, in itself, proves that the Commission sets great store by sending out a clear message. At the same time, we have to be careful we do not fall into the trap of communicating for communication’s sake. In communication, less is often more. Moreover, the way it is done is only one of the two components of successful communication. We must also ask ourselves what exactly we want to say about the future of Europe and, above all, how this message relates to the action which the European Union has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The information which the Commission’s activities have produced so far is in this respect very interesting. Public surveys – I refer in particular to Eurobarometer – have revealed that Europeans have high expectations of the European Union in many areas, which inevitably leads us to conclude that a negative vote on the EU is in any event partly attributable to the fact that the European Union does not perform the way it should. I do not, then, have any problem with the Commission focusing on a concrete agenda of policy. Does this, though, sufficiently highlight the context in which we have to operate? I have a few observations to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the citizens’ agenda must be sufficiently substantial in order to meet the citizens’ expectations at least to some extent. Has the Commission in this respect achieved enough or has it only considered policy that is already in the pipeline? Moreover, we must not only consider the expectations – which the Commission has clearly done – but also the citizens’ perception of the environment. Should we not carry out studies into the way in which the citizens experience Europe and ask ourselves whether the citizens’ agenda can make a positive contribution to day-to-day life?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an agenda such as this creates expectations which we need to meet. Indeed, if we clearly state what we want to achieve and then fail to deliver, then this will only contribute to a negative opinion about the European Union, which brings me to my last point.</p>
<p class="contents">Which is the question as to the direction of the debate about Europe’s future in the different Member States. Whilst the Commission, based on what emerged from the Eurobarometer survey, has managed to indicate the topics that are of concern for the Europeans, how does it assess the state of affairs in all those national discussions about European cooperation, the direction in which we are going, and the constitution? Is some degree of convergence kicking in, or are we still no further down the road than we were in July 2005?</p>
<p class="contents">All institutions have a role to play, but certainly as a Member of this House, I should like to draw the Council’s attention to its particular responsibility for the execution of a substantial policy agenda that is necessary to get the public to back the European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to stress how the EU offers both security in the classic sense and an internal strengthening and dynamism, which makes us able to compete in the world and deliver prosperity. The Commission action on mobile roaming charges is excellent, by the way.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to concentrate on security in the justice field. The single most visible demonstration of the EU’s usefulness to my London constituents that I have experienced came last summer. Under European arrest warrants, a suspected murderer was brought back from Latvia in four weeks and a suspected terrorist back from Italy in six weeks. That was a real illustration of the EU delivering the increased security from crime and terrorism our citizens want. The British Conservatives, incidentally, are playing a weak hand on law and order in opposing the European arrest warrant. So I strongly support President Barroso’s push to improve decision-making on justice matters, with laws on police and judicial cooperation and legal migration progressed through more effective and democratic and open methods.</p>
<p class="contents">But the EU should also be united, solid and active on human rights. There is a lot of support for the EU playing a strong role in the world, promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law. But there has never been a Council common position or joint action under the CSFP calling for the closure of Guantánamo Bay or even just for the return of our own citizens and residents.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, our Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition heard Javier Solana say he had no power to check whether Member States were upholding their human rights commitments. I said that this conveyed a pathetic image of the EU. Now Tony Blair, far from leading a national debate on the benefits of Europe, is conniving disgracefully in a dangerous and populist attack by Conservatives and the media on the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us concentrate on delivering a real citizens’ Europe, security from terrorism and organised crime and from abuses of fundamental rights and discrimination, and promotion of Europe’s soft power in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Europe which has no foreign policy, but is led back and forth by the Americans? What Europe? The Europe which has no army of its own and has a European army with an American commander-in-chief like ΝΑΤΟ? What Europe? The Europe with no energy policy? Are we conspiring against Putin, who will give us gas, and getting embroiled in the trouble the Americans want in the Gulf so we cannot have cheap oil? What Europe? The Europe without enough democracy? Talk to me about a single electoral system! You have one set of electoral rules, I have another, someone else has another. What Europe? The Europe which cannot have a single referendum because in some countries parliaments are in charge and in others the people?</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are not one Europe with a future, because for one country, one nation, one union to have a future, it must know what it is and where it wants to go.

That is what we should call to mind, and it is a crucial point; it is something that is now simply taken for granted, rather than being – as it once was – regarded as a positive gain. Nor is ‘no more war’, and the fact that there has been none, enough any more, although it is still decisive. Even though we know how thin the ice of civilisation is, we are unable to communicate to our citizens the real reasons for European integration, because what we talk about never rises above the trivial, and by ‘we’, I mean the governments in particular. When I think back to how some talked about nothing but their own status as net contributors, while others, who had got five billion, nevertheless complained about not getting ten billion more, so that that ten billion became the sole subject of discussion and was taken as evidence of a lack of European solidarity, then we cannot be surprised to find the state of affairs that we do at grassroots level at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to urge the national governments to at long last get back to telling the truth and giving the people comprehensive information, and the Commission not to dispense them from this obligation and not to be over-cautious in this regard. I hope that the document submitted for our consideration today will be a first step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that misunderstandings in this respect need to be avoided. True though it is to say that what matters is that this Europe of ours, as it is presently constituted, should be got moving again, with progress – which alone is convincing – in important areas, the impression must not be given – as it is being to some extent in the media – that this is an alternative programme to the Constitution. It has to be made clear that we want, by doing this, to put the case for the Constitution and to make good use of the time remaining before it enters into force, but also that it is indispensable to achieving certain crucial objectives, not only in the institutional sphere with such things as voting rights, numbers of seats, and foreign and security policy, but primarily for the public good. It has to be made plain that it is the Constitution alone that puts the citizen centre stage; that this is not merely a union of states but also a union of citizens, and that those citizens have rights; that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is of fundamental significance in terms of the future conception of the European Union; and that the European elections have something to do with the President of the Commission being chosen by the citizens and the Commission thereby being harnessed to the popular will. These are the crucial points where we have to make progress, and it is in this respect that we are sometimes lacking in courage.</p>
<p class="contents">I was put in a very optimistic mood when a young Member State, two years after its accession to the European Union, on Europe Day – Schuman Day – ratified the Constitution by a 73:1 vote, and the country of which I speak is Estonia. Something that is equally remarkable is the tremendous achievement on the part of the Finnish Parliament last week. I hope this will be an incentive for the countries – such as Portugal – that will succeed Finland in the presidency of the Council. Further to what Chancellor Merkel said in the <span class="italic">Bundestag </span>last week, I take it as read that the German Presidency will discharge the obligation placed upon it by its coalition agreement. We want this constitutional treaty, and we will do everything possible to see that it is ratified; I hope, Madam Vice-President, that the Commission will join in this endeavour with all the courage at its disposal.</p>

We need debates and I know from experience in my country that the more people are informed about the European Union, the more positive they tend to be with regard to it. That is why people like Nigel Farage and UKIP have consistently opposed Plan D, the funding of it and its stimulation of debates about Europe. They want people to rely on their ill-informed prejudices about Europe. We must counter that. We must stimulate the widest possible debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is right for the debate on the future of Europe to be prolonged. We need at least another year. We need wider and deeper reflection. It is right to say that so far the reflection has been less about the text and more about the context. However, we also know that we will, in due course, have to address what to do about this text. The debate will need more structuring and more focus, perhaps along the lines on which Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Stubb spoke just now. We will have to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is far too simplistic to say, as Mr Farage and Mr Kirkhope did, that the people have spoken and they have spoken against the Constitution. That is simply not true. We have different answers across Europe. A majority supports this Constitution, even in countries which held referendums. If you add all the referendums together, more people voted ‘yes’ than voted ‘no’. Overall, as Commission Wallström said, we will soon have 16 States in favour. In fact, if you add Romania and Bulgaria, 18 ratifications will be in the bag by the end of next month. That is going on. It is a question of divergence, not opposition to the Constitution. When we have divergence in this Union, we talk it through to find a solution to make it acceptable to everyone, recognising the majority trend and trying to find out what adjustments might be necessary to make the minority able to accept it as well. We have a duty to the minority to talk it through and find a compromise, but we cannot ignore the will of the majority either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What they want is solutions to problems, and, from time to time, a vision – yes, that as well – and they want their problems, fears and worries to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">What the results from France and the Netherlands show is that this European Union of ours has not, so far, been successful enough in doing this. This rejection did not, however, plunge the European Union into a crisis; rather, it did no more than make it clear that the EU was already in one. According to Eurobarometer, even in Germany, only 38% of the public believe that their vote counts, so we need to make an active effort to seek the public’s approval for the EU, and now we have the chance to do it, for the fact is that the first step is very simple. We have to make it credible that the ‘no’ uttered by two countries in the EU is actually accepted as such.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worse than a ‘no’ vote is a ‘no’ vote that politicians do not take seriously. This does not mean that the constitution is dead, but it is a reason why we cannot vote again on a constitutional treaty in unamended form. The Constitution must be revised, with its component parts kept separate from specific policies. The simple fact is that it has to be made clear that, for example, the EU’s goals and values are not the same thing as policies on fisheries or electronic waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As for argument – day-to-day political argument – well, we need that too. Most of it has to do with the sectoral policies; if the whole debate around the services directive showed anything, it was, no doubt, that the public are actually interested in what goes on in this place. Arguments are the salt in the democratic soup; many in this House will be aware that I was not happy with what happened to the services directive, but I was pleased that 30 000 people were here in Strasbourg demonstrating, for that is real dialogue with the citizens, in comparison with which Plan D has something artificial about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be clear to us that we have to hold fast to the separation of the powers, and that is why I want to spell it out to the House that anyone who promises, here in this House today, that national models of the welfare state will be transposed to the European level, is trying to hoodwink the public. We have neither the money, nor the legal basis, nor the powers to do that. If you want to make social policy – and it is quite acceptable that you should – then please use the national parliaments as your base for doing it. If we make empty promises, then the 20 million unemployed will be given no hope, and everyone else will make us aware of how they have become more – rather than less – disenchanted with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So I urge you that what we should be doing is to democratise the European Union’s powers, perform its functions well and make sure, at the next European elections, that we get a Europe-wide referendum on the revised text of the Constitution, and also elect the President of the Commission from among our own number. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us elect, by direct means, a convention to be given the task of producing a democratic constitution and a cooperation agreement between democracies. Let the voters then choose between them in a referendum in every country on the same day. In this way we can attain the ground rules that our people want. Until then we should introduce practical reforms characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people. Create new rules of procedure in the Council and the Commission so that, from now on, all meetings are open and all documents public unless there are good arguments for sitting behind closed doors or otherwise dealing with a matter in secret.</p>
<p class="contents">Let the national parliaments question their Commissioner each Friday, and why not let the voters choose their own Commissioner directly next time around. Resolve that we will never vote in favour of an EU law that has not obtained a majority in either the national parliament or the European Parliament. Last year, the EU adopted 3 124 regulations. The European Parliament was involved in just 57 of them. Put an end to this democratic deficit now, and also listen to those who voted ‘no’. Mr Barroso and Mrs Wallström will be visiting Copenhagen on Friday. The official programme provides for not a single speaker representing the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes. You listen largely to yourselves, while the Commission pays for events, think-tanks and movements in favour of the failed Constitution. Close the purse strings to propaganda, or give funding only to events that are pluralist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We decided then – and rightly so – that after the 'no', we should focus the debate more on the environment prevailing around the European constitution; in other words, we should focus on the context and leave the text to one side a little. Unfortunately, however, we spoke little about the context and, by contrast, we allowed a school of thought to burgeon that the problem was actually in the text. If, however, we look, for example, at the area of freedom, justice and security, we can see that, over the last year, it is the context rather than the text that is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the European constitution protects democracy in the European Union by giving Parliament a codecision role on most matters in the area of freedom and security. The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights demonstrates that we do not consider fundamental rights as a 'bolt on' to the necessary protection of the security of the citizens, but as a central part of our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the text<span class="italic">,</span> the context has become more and more problematic over the last year: we have a series of laws that increase anti-terrorist cooperation. At the same time, however, the Council still contends that the much desired and necessary framework decision for data protection in the third pillar will probably not even be approved by the end of 2006.</p>

It is a missed opportunity because you give the impression that the whole programme could be realised by the existing Treaty of Nice and that the constitutional treaty could be put on the back burner. That, at any rate, is the impression that Mr Barroso has given in his speeches and statements, and that is what the people of Europe have come to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">The new ‘plan D’ ought to do both. You ought to be setting out the great challenges and suggesting ways of resolving them, while also telling people what works with the present Treaty and what would work better with the new one. This is what you are failing to communicate; instead, you are hiding behind the governments and letting us here in this Parliament do most of the work, and that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">All your posturing about the completion of the internal market will not help to defuse the prejudice against the new treaty, which is prompting people to spread rumours about this being a superstate, a neoliberal concept, about the unbridled centralisation and militarisation of the EU, and this ‘plan D’ is doing nothing to lay these prejudices to rest. When the day of truth comes – which it will – we will have to get the treaty accepted in the remaining Member States, and all I can say to you is that many small projects for Europe are no substitute for the great European project that is the Constitution. I hope you will succeed in combining the two; only then will you have done your job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is beginning thanks to the parliamentary forum that we held in Brussels last week, which was a real success. It is also being encouraged by Estonia’s decision, the announcement made by Finland, the statement from the Irish Prime Minister, the speech made by Mrs Merkel before the <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> and the words of President Napolitano who, when he took office yesterday, stated clearly that there was no alternative to the European constitutional process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is being encouraged by all these factors, Commissioner, but not particularly by the words of Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso should be capable of providing the political leadership of a President of the European Commission who helped to draw up the Constitution and is in favour of it. That he should not be so is unbelievable.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I read your Communication to the Council very carefully. To be honest, it would be more interesting for any citizen to read the first and second parts of the Constitution, which are obviously easier to understand, than this document. Despite all of your good intentions, no one will understand it. What is its objective? What is its purpose?</p>
<p class="contents">There will be solemn declarations next year saying that we need a Europe of plans rather than a plan for Europe. No, there is no Europe of plans, but a plan for Europe, and that plan is the Constitution. The objective can be nothing other than bringing it into force within the right timeframe, in other words with the changes that need to be made and in a different political context, but without losing our way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to inform my colleague, Mr Stubb, that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at what has happened in Europe and when we consider all the words, emotions and print pages that have been published on the future plan for Europe, one key element is missed. That is that what the people across the European Union have said, not just in the referenda on the Constitution but also in previous European elections, was a cry for help. They wanted a greater understanding and a greater knowledge of what Europe is. The people we meet on the streets every day are not afraid of Europe or of the European Union. They are not even afraid of further development or enlargement of the European Union. However, there is a lack of engagement with the European Union and often a lack of trust about where they see the European Union going. When we speak about Plan D for democracy and so on and we put forward these plans, they must be based on what people want.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of my colleagues have spoken about the blame game and who is more to blame, because President Barroso did not say this or a government did not say that. Let us be realistic. Some Member States have agreed a text on the Constitution for the future of Europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement, to make sure they convince their people. I would never dream of going to France, Holland or Germany and telling the voters there what they should be doing. It is up to the representatives of those countries themselves to be realistic and not hypocritical, not to play party politics and hide behind doublespeak.</p>
<p class="contents">Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive. Governments previously agreed in the secrecy of the Council to have a Services Directive, it was put together and then suddenly pressure was applied and they all backed off and said it must be changed. Ultimately that played into the hands of Parliament, because it made us look strong. We could take the concerns of citizens on board and force a change in those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Plan D must be about proper debate and engagement with people; it must be about respecting the diversity in the European Union; it must be about giving definition to European Union. But, most importantly, it must be about debunking the myths, not just those in the media but the ones we ourselves perpetuate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it will help in the ongoing discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">When I entered politics many years ago, I learnt that there were three basic tasks for any political party or organisation. The first: to be able to describe reality, so that people will recognise reality as it is and agree that is the correct way to describe the world in which they live. The second task is to be able to put forward a vision, to say ‘this is where we want to go, that is what we want to achieve one day’. And, thirdly, to be able to change reality, to implement or enforce the changes that we want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is still valid. It is exactly the Commission’s line. We have a plan. We are willing to show leadership, first of all by being able to describe the reality we live in. Indeed, we have tried to help by describing what we have heard through our Plan D activities and from the Member States and all the institutions involved in these activities, including visits to pubs. I was in London last Friday to listen to the fears the British people expressed about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have been repeating that we want solidarity, prosperity and security, the values that we have set out in our treaties. Thirdly, we have been showing the way, by changing the reality of the world in which we live. That is the way to engage people and to prove the added value of the European Union: by working together to change people’s everyday lives. This we know from the Eurobarometer surveys and from all our contacts. That is what people expect from us. That is how we can come back and approach the constitutional issues, because that is the way to prove that we have to change the way we take decisions. We must prove that we have to make the European Union more open and democratic. We cannot stop that work now and say that we will just wait for a constitution. We have to do both things. We have to move in parallel on both those tracks. That is the only way to regain citizens’ trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel a lot of frustration, as you do, at having lost a project of the kind the Constitution represents. But the way to remedy that is not through personal attacks or attempts to engage only in bold rhetoric. There has been a lack of concrete suggestions as to what to do in France and the Netherlands, where we have had a ‘no’ and where we have to engage with citizens again to regain their trust in any constitutional project. That is really what we ought to discuss. What kind of agenda can we establish to rebuild trust in those countries that are experiencing many problems?</p>
<p class="contents">One idea was mentioned has my strong support. Mr Méndez de Vigo suggested looking at the costs of a non-Europe. I think that is an excellent idea and worth exploring. Let us see if we can do that together and subsequently describe our findings. We have a number of examples to describe to people the costs of non-Europe: energy policy and the fact that we do not have a foreign affairs minister, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">It will make us less effective, less visible, less democratic and less open. We definitely have to end the blame game, because we are not alone in this: we need the Member State governments. Why should the Swedish Government, or any other government that has not yet ratified, engage in a project or stick their necks out in a situation where they see that there is no solution? Nobody has presented a solution so far, but there are at least seven or eight different ideas on how to take this project forward. The Commission’s idea is, therefore, to begin by proving the added value of the European project by changing reality and doing our best to respond to citizens’ concerns. Whether it is energy policy, tackling unemployment or fighting crime and terrorism, we have to take action. Meanwhile, we should also point out that a constitutional settlement would help us greatly to act even more effectively. At the same time, we must engage with governments to ensure that we sign up to the things we want to see realised in the future and that we share the same values and ideas for the future. That is a step towards finding a constitutional settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want a two-speed Europe or core groups. We believe that Member States should act in unison and that we should hold the European project together. This means moving on both these tracks at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have demonstrated here that we have heard what people have told us regarding the priorities, and I think you agree with me. The first issues people raise when we speak to them in pubs, universities or elsewhere are the tangible issues. They want policies to be settled; they want us to take action on things that affect their everyday lives. That is what they expect from us. This also makes it easier to return to the constitutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We can definitely follow up the idea of describing the costs of non-Europe. We should also establish a timetable for a constitutional settlement. That is why we pointed to the opportunity next year, when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, for Member States to agree on the way forward. This is our response to citizens’ concerns. Being able to explain a citizens’ agenda – the people’s priorities – is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kirkhope is not here, but let me say that the fight against terrorism is a very important argument. Are we really convinced that national vetoes should remain? The European Evidence Warrant is one example, and it is still blocked in the Council. This is a very important proposal that would help our law-enforcement authorities to do their work more effectively. We will move forward with these proposals. The Constitution is not dead. The Estonians explained that they ratified it, not because they think that this issue will be solved immediately, but as a political statement. That was their purpose. However, they also realise that we have to look for solutions that satisfy both the French and the Dutch people and the other Member States, including those who said ‘yes’. It is not that easy to tell those countries that they have to do it again because we have made some changes. Today we see no immediate solutions to this problem, but we will continue to show leadership on the constitutional issues as well as changing people’s reality and will set a policy agenda, a citizens’ agenda.</p>
