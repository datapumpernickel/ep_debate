<p class="contents">I tabled a question to the Council for February's Question Time on "the responsibilities of Mr Solana and the Balkan syndrome" under Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure. I have received a letter from Mr Correa in the <span class="italic">Division des activitέs des deput</span><span class="italic">és</span>, which says that the President instructs me to inform you that your question number such and such has not been entered for Question Time because questions are only accepted on condition that they do not contain assertions or opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex ΙΙ to the Rules of Procedure does indeed state that questions must not contain assertions or opinions. However, I see here, for example, that Mr Gahrton's valuable Question No 3 states: "Unfortunately, the Finnish, Portuguese and French Presidencies chose to disregard Parliament's recommendation." Similarly, question no. 7 by Mr Nogueira Román states: "In view of the reprehensible inertia of the Spanish authorities, what steps has the Council taken to put an end to this tragic situation?" Not just opinions, but opinions on the liability of European Union government authorities for the deaths of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, I think that this intervention and the withdrawal of my question on Mr Solana are unacceptable and I would ask the Bureau as a whole to reconsider and enter it on the next agenda. It does not contain any more opinions or assertions than most questions tabled by Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I once again refer to the ‘capacity declaration’. I do not think it is possible to be any clearer than that is. It states that everything done with regard to the common European security and defence policy must be carried out in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress what is already well known to Mr Schmid, that it is also the case that all measures taken within the framework of the common European security and defence policy are a type of intergovernmental cooperation, which means firstly that there should be agreement among the Member States and secondly that there should be the opportunity for individual countries to decide for themselves the extent to which they want to participate in such operations, if at all. We also know that in a number of Member States, depending to some extent upon national tradition, various forms of reference to the UN Charter are required for the country to take part in an intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, it is a case of belt and braces regarding this issue. I believe we can sleep soundly in our beds. European crisis management will be carried out in line with the principles of the UN Charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have asked a very clear question about whether an absolute mandate is required for military action. It is not about the general principles. It is not about spirit or other higher values. It is about the concrete fact of having an express mandate from the UN for military action.

Instead, Mr Danielsson comes out with a long explanation to the effect that the operations are in keeping with the UN Charter. I have never heard any head of state or any representative of an international organisation maintain that what they were doing was contrary to the UN Charter. They always maintain that it is not. However, it is very interesting that, after four successive attempts to obtain a clear answer to the question that has been asked, we cannot obtain such an answer.

<p class="contents">On 17 January 2001, the European Parliament delivered its opinion on a proposal for creating an EU rapid reaction facility, pointing out that priority must be given to non-military crisis management and citing as a suitable way forward the recommendation it made to the Council in spring 1999 that a civil peace corps be established.

This has been reflected in the conclusion from the European Councils up to and including the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency is actively proceeding with the task assigned by the European Council in Nice. The work is quite complicated both in the civil and the military spheres as the EU is creating new resources and structures. The work in the civil sphere is currently focused on achieving the concrete aims established at the European Council in Feira, i.e. by 2003 to be able to mobilise up to 5 000 police for international assignments across the spectrum of operations to prevent conflict and manage crises. It must be possible to mobilise 1 000 police within 30 days.</p>
<p class="contents">The work in other prioritised areas, as established in Feira – particularly with regard to strengthening the rule of law, but also rescue services and civil administration – will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Swedish Presidency has clarified the fact that it is appropriate, as the EU’s civil crisis management continues to develop, also to establish other areas within the framework of civil crisis management in which EU resources may need to be developed or used more effectively. Such areas may include expertise in democracy and human rights plus monitors and observers of various kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mechanisms for improved cooperation with voluntary organisations which participate in conflict prevention and in initiatives to promote peace after a conflict, such as improvements to the EU’s diplomatic instrument for conflict prevention, will also be drawn up in the European programme on conflict prevention, which is expected to be approved by the European Council in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, the EU has reformed and concentrated the work of its monitoring missions and placed it under the control of the Secretary-General. Moreover, the monitoring mission recently showed its value when it was deployed in Presevo Valley.</p>
<p class="contents">All this work is moving in the same direction, and has the same aims, as the European Parliament’s recommendation on establishing a civil peace corps. The Council prefers to complete the aforementioned work, i.e. an operational capacity in the field, before the end of the year with the aims and deadlines set out by the European Council. The Council will then be better able to assess what other arrangements might be warranted or necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The presidency report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, which was approved by the European Council in Nice, confirmed that the EU project is of an open nature. It contains arrangements for the EU’s military crisis management which enable consultation with, and participation of, European NATO members which are not members of the EU and other countries which are candidates for accession to the EU. The principle of the EU’s independence in decision-making must, of course, be taken into account in this openness.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in the conclusions from the European Council in Nice the EU reiterates the importance attached to being able to call on NATO’s funds and resources when necessary, in line with the Washington Summit Communiqué.

Mr Danielsson, I hope you appreciate the gravity of this matter. I realise that the fourth framework directive cannot offer any direct solace, but some voluntarism on the part of the Council would be in order. The directive affects hundreds of citizens who cannot be remunerated, who suffer a great deal, and a certain level of voluntarism would not go amiss in my opinion. I would remind you of previous action taken. On one occasion, the French President, Mr Chirac, flew to Bern to protect the export of 50 000 bottles of champagne and to galvanise the Swiss Government into action. I also remember a similar case, where Belgium took action to protect Belgian citizens. The Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Michel, has since got involved. I would therefore really appreciate it if the Council could generate some activity here and ensure that we can in some way help the European citizens, who genuinely become the victims of the bad handling of affairs between the European Union, the insurance companies and the Swiss insurance companies. I am telling you, this is really about people who suffer from this state of affairs. I have personally met people who have been fighting for their cause for over eighteen years. This is unacceptable in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, it will be prohibited, where such documents are concerned, to exercise the right to freedom of expression and public access to documents under the Swedish constitution. And we shall, of course, be seeing the first real test of that kind of potential conflict on 6 March when Bernard Connelly’s case is heard at the European Court of Justice. The Court will adopt a position on whether what counts is the interpretation of the Council of Europe, Sweden and Denmark and a few other countries of officials’ right to express opinions, or whether it is, instead, the advocate-general’s restrictive interpretation that counts. That conflict will be clearly decided then and there, and that is why I should like to see a commitment from the Swedish Presidency that it will not under any circumstances agree to a situation in which either the regulation concerned or any other authority is able to restrict either officials’ current right to express opinions or the public’s current right of access to information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Measures to improve the effectiveness of Member States’ control of airspace and external sea borders have mostly been drawn up within the framework of the Schengen cooperation and, now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force, have now been incorporated into EU legislation. These measures are carried out by the Member States themselves, but the Council monitors actual implementation through its relevant subordinate bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Practical measures are carried out in cooperation with selected African states, for example, to prevent illegal immigration, by air or by sea, based on the decision of Schengen’s Executive Committee of 18 December 1998 on a coordinated initiative from the document advisers. In a decision on 28 April 1999, the same executive committee also approved a plan for mutual placement of liaison officers to offer advice and support when security and control assignments are carried out along external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to issues concerning the Schengen acquis, illegal immigration to the EU constitutes one of the major issues being dealt with by the Council, based on conclusions from several meetings of the European Council – Tampere, Feira and Nice to name but a few. As the honourable Member no doubt knows, the European Council obliged the EU to intensify cooperation to combat trafficking in human beings following the tragic events in Dover last year.</p>
<p class="contents">After the conclusions from the European Council meetings, which emphasised the importance of controlling migration flows, the Council has discussed both operational measures and regulations for combating trafficking in human beings. In this regard, the Council adopted resolutions on 30 November last year which contained various operational measures to combat illegal immigration, such as the exchange of information on observed migration flows, the optimisation of the early warning system, the transfer of information on illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and the coordination of the network for Member State liaison officers in the countries in which the illegal immigration originates.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the basic causes of flight or migration from a number of African countries, we refer you to the action plan for Morocco which was approved by the Council on 11 October 1999 and of which Parliament is hopefully aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of implementing the action plan for Morocco, and as the EU is aware that the action plan must be implemented through partnership and cooperation with the Moroccan authorities, a delegation from the EU under the leadership of the presidency made a second visit to Rabat to open a dialogue with the Moroccan authorities. The message which the presidency wished to get across during this visit, which took place on 3 October last year, was that the action plan for Morocco was the result of work originally started by the Member States and the Commission and that it was now time to ask for the reactions of the Moroccan parties and to make the necessary adjustments of the action plan so that it could be implemented jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Moroccan authorities welcomed this course of action and the idea of opening a dialogue with the EU on immigration issues. This dialogue will take place within the framework of the association agreement with Morocco once agreement has been reached on setting up a working party on social and migration issues. The Council’s subordinate bodies are currently looking at a proposal from the Commission on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Danielsson, I see this question as a political question, which it is; but most of all as a humanitarian question. You have just mentioned the Dover tragedy, which all Europeans regret, but I must say – and I have direct experience of this problem, even though I do not live in southern Spain – that there in Andalusia and also sometimes in the Canary Islands we experience a Dover every week. What is happening in southern Spain is much more serious than Dover, Mr Danielsson, and I believe it requires some interference, if I may use this expression. In Austria, the European Member States interfered when faced with the threat of xenophobia. I believe this question is so serious that it requires some special action.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for your answer, which was otherwise full and informed, but I believe a far more serious intervention is needed. Every week, hundreds of people are detained on the Spanish coastline and every week people die, often pregnant women, and as I said the other day, children too. Have a look at the photos that appear in the Spanish press (I am just finishing, Mr President), Mr Danielsson, and you will be shocked.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I ask you to go beyond your clarifications and tell me what explanations you are requesting from the Spanish authorities and whether you will demand from them not just political measures but humanitarian ones too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a problem that must, of course, be dealt with wherever in the Union it occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on this problem must consist of two elements. One element involves fighting the criminality that is associated with trafficking in human beings and the like. However, it is perhaps even more important to carry out preventive work, namely to work in the way that the Council has chosen to do in the case of Morocco. We have gone to the source, so to speak – to the cause of these types of migratory flows, and we have tried to put right the underlying problem. I am convinced that with joint efforts we can achieve success.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important issue under the Swedish Presidency. I also believe that it will be an even more important matter under the Belgian Presidency, when matters of asylum and migration and that which was achieved at the Tampere Summit are to be evaluated.

<p class="contents">You see, the Spanish Government, through the Civil Guard, has intercepted 133 leisure craft and 2 300 dinghies in five years, resulting in 203 immigrants dead, over 200 missing and 377 rescued, and I underline rescued, all coming from Morocco. The Spanish Government, through the Civil Guard, has implemented an information system to prevent shipwrecks in the Straits, at a cost of 13 600 million pesetas, for which Spain has requested European Union funding. The Spanish Government has pushed forward the Action Plan on Morocco, as mentioned by the Council representative, which this Parliament approved with a budget line of EUR 10 million. I was the rapporteur for that plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr President, comes my question: when will the Council submit a progress report on the action plan for Morocco to which he has referred? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council regrets that the sad reality in Afghanistan shows that, so far, the Taliban have been unreceptive to arguments and pressure from outside, despite the efforts of the Union and of the international community. Both parties to the conflict are continuing their military operations and a political solution to the conflict still seems far away. There is a pressing need to improve the outrageous situation in respect of human rights but, under the conditions that prevail in the country, the prospects of an improvement are, unfortunately, not particularly bright.</p>
<p class="contents">The Taliban control around 90% of the territory of Afghanistan. Since the military situation in the country is changing all the time, however, the Council has no precise information on the number of women living under the Kabul regime at any given point in time. Moreover, the catastrophic situation in respect of humanitarian circumstances and human rights in the country has led to massive emigration of refugees to neighbouring countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, making it even more difficult to make an assessment of the population situation in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has often taken up the issue of the critical situation of the Afghan refugees with the host countries in the area and will continue to do so in future. The Community and several of the Member States will also continue to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghans when the circumstances permit. The majority of this aid benefits women.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently updated common position of 25 January 2001 forms the basis of the Union’s policy in respect of Afghanistan. The Union is continuing its efforts to bring about lasting peace, to get foreign intervention to cease and to encourage internal dialogue in Afghanistan. In particular, the Union emphasises the importance of encouraging respect for international humanitarian law and human rights, including the rights of women and children. The Union will therefore continue to call upon all parties to recognise, protect and promote all human rights and basic liberties and to respect the general declaration of human rights that Afghanistan has in fact signed.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to call upon the Afghan factions to cease their discriminatory policy and to recognise, protect and encourage equal rights and dignity for men and women, including access to education and health facilities, employment, personal safety and the absence of injustices and persecution, as well as emphasising the negative consequences that discriminatory policy will have for active supply of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will continue to support the proposal by the Secretary-General of the UN for civil human rights observers and will also continue to support such aid programmes in Afghanistan as integrate equality issues and actively attempt to encourage the participation of both men and women on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will be attaching particular importance to human rights when it comes to the international coordination of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The Council hopes that the latest sanctions, based on UN Security Council Resolution No 13033, which the Council is currently discussing in order to adopt the corresponding common position and regulation as soon as possible, will contribute to reducing foreign involvement and encourage a negotiated solution to the Afghan conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, do you accept that this is a new and profoundly oppressive instance of the subordination of women and their seclusion into private life? For many years women in Afghanistan enjoyed a fully public existence, participating in the professions and in the world of work and dressing appropriately. Sometimes it is said that appeals to human rights involve imposing western values on non-western cultures. That is false, and this particular case in Afghanistan shows it to be so.

<p class="contents">The Council is pleased to tell MEPs that the environmental protection requirements under article 6 of the EC Treaty are to be integrated into the elaboration and implementation of the Community’s policies and activities, particularly with a view to encouraging sustainable development. The strategies for incorporating environmental dimensions into the Council’s activities will be established ahead of the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June of this year. At this stage, therefore, it is a touch early to report on the details of all these strategies. The Presidency and the Commission are currently working intensively on these matters in the various Council constellations concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1999 in Helsinki, the Council established the timetable for the European Council in Gothenburg and called upon the Council to complete its work on incorporating the environmental dimensions into all the Council’s activities by producing overall strategies, if possible accompanied by a timetable for the measures to be taken and a set of indicators for the sectors concerned. Once these strategies have been established, they should help with carrying out the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, supplement measures at national and regional level and emphasise the need for closer cooperation between different areas of sectoral policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, the important role that these strategies will play for the implementation of sustainable development is therefore obvious. The implementation and follow up of all this work has been entrusted to the Commission and the Council. Internally within the Council, the various bodies that prepare the considerations have a duty to use the various steps of the traditional decision-making process to ensure good coordination in order, as best as possible, to meet the challenge set by the European Council. The participation of Parliament will be ensured in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stressed that the Council shares the view of MEPs and is prepared, together with all the political and economic players in this area, to ensure success with a holistic approach when it comes to environmental matters within the various policy areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the integration of environmental dimensions and sustainable development in all sector policy, much can be said concerning how and to what extent the Council is applying the provisions of article 6 of the Treaty. Without dealing with this matter exhaustively – which is not possible because it covers an incredibly wide area – I would like to emphasise some of the most relevant aspects of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">First there is energy policy, which the Council considers to be one of its highest priority areas. The Council is fully contributing to the three important objectives emphasised in the programme of the Swedish Presidency for this six months. In this respect, the Council would remind MEPs of the Council’s conclusions of December 1999, which already contain a detailed preliminary set of indicators covering the area of energy in general, including the environmental consequences, the energy market and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of these conclusions and the set of indicators is to be evaluated at two-yearly intervals. In addition, a final decision is expected this year on the directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">To prepare the way for the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June, the Council will discuss a communication concerning the integration of the environment dimensions and sustainable development into energy policy, as well as the proposed sixth action plan at Community level for sustainable development. Both are to be presented by the Commission in the next few weeks. A number of measures are to commence within the framework of the action plan for increased energy efficiency based on the priorities established by the Council at its meeting on 5 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the industrial side of this overall strategy is concerned, the Council would remind MEPs that, in the report to the European Council in Helsinki, it was emphasised that a strong contribution was required from the industrial sector in order to strengthen sustainable development in the economic area. At the same time, it set out once again the key role that this sector has in respect of improving the competitiveness of European industry and its capacity for innovation in order to encourage employment within industry and related sectors. The horizontal nature of this issue calls for better cooperation and exchange of information between all the parties and decision-makers concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again: hopefully, the conclusions that will be established at the European Council summit in Gothenburg will be of very great interest. To show, through a concrete measure, the extent to which the Council is attempting to maximise the integrated strategy when it comes to environmental matters, the Council intends to draw up certain conclusions at the Council meeting in May at which both energy and industry ministers will gather together in order to take this work further.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as economic and financial matters are concerned, the Council wishes to inform MEPs that, at the European Council summit in Nice, the Council submitted an initial report concerning how environmental dimensions can be integrated into the economic policy of the Union and its Member States. In this area, the Gothenburg Summit will once again follow up this report and, in particular, will investigate how a European strategy for sustainable economic development can be elaborated in which environmental dimensions are taken into consideration. The Ecofin Council will undoubtedly be urged to apply such a strategy within its area of authority as soon as the European Council has approved such a strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question should therefore, in the first instance, be put to the Members of the Commission. However, since the question is nevertheless such an important part of the Swedish Presidency, I cannot refrain from nonetheless giving the viewpoints of the Swedish Presidency concerning the components that the strategy for sustainable development should include.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is incredibly important that, in the strategy which we hope will be adopted in Gothenburg, we will clearly include three elements that should form part of the concept of sustainable development. These should be the ecological element, the economic element and the social element. We know that two of these elements, namely socially sustainable development and economically sustainable development, will be discussed as early as the Stockholm Summit. We intend to supplement the discussion in Stockholm of these two elements with ecologically sustainable development, so to speak, and then make this into a common strategy that can be adopted at the Gothenburg Summit.</p>

I refer to the Transport Council and in particular to the latest report on the concrete implementation of the strategy, which showed a distinct lack of progress on many fronts in the transport field. The strategy raises serious concerns about the transport implications of enlargement, but the report did not suggest much in the way of concrete measures. What concrete measures does the presidency propose? Such measures are essential if transport is to be fully taken into account in the enlargement process which, it is to be hoped, will result in environmentally sustainable policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely correct, as the Member points out, that the Council and the Commission need to devote more energy to disseminating the results of this work to the public. Within the framework of the general efforts by the Swedish Presidency to increase openness, we plan to ensure that, after the Gothenburg Summit, the results of the Council’s discussions are disseminated widely through the Internet, through attempting to ensure that the decisions that are taken are disseminated and put in terms in which citizens can understand them.

There are great many concrete plans, but the Council has not yet had opportunity to discuss this. Consequently I must ask to be allowed to come back to you with more concrete news. We expect the Council (Transport) to meet in early April of this year. We shall then be able to obtain answers to the questions that the Member has put.</p>
