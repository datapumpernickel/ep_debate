Russia, too, attaches great importance to the Summit. Initially created as a forum for political dialogue, over the course of the years the Summit has become an occasion for both parties to review and revitalise at the highest level the entire spectrum of their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Villa Madama Summit gave the go-ahead for the practical implementation of the St Petersburg Declaration, where it lays down that European Union-Russia relations must be built around common spaces, to be created in the medium to long term within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement currently in force. The main aim was to make further progress in respect of all the common spaces by making the best use of existing structures and tools with a view to enhancing strategic relations and driving forward the process of integrating the Russian Federation into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union, the Summit provided an opportunity to remind Moscow of our common commitment to tackling the current challenges and to discharging in a coordinated manner our shared responsibility for the environmental protection of the continent, and of the need to share information and work together to resolve the problems caused by climate change. The meeting allowed the European Union and the Russian Federation to look at current global issues, including crisis situations and what are known as the frozen conflicts in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency, however, was concerned with keeping the main emphasis on the creation of the four common spaces and on the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation, and therefore focused on the major tangible achievements of the Summit, in particular a Joint Declaration on the CFSP and on cooperation in crisis management, the signing of the Agreement between Europol and the Russian Federation, the start of talks on the visa-free regime and the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russians endorsed the approach and the emphasis given to the creation of the four spaces. The Summit, which took place at a sensitive moment in Russian domestic politics – parliamentary elections will be held next December and presidential elections in March 2004 – also afforded President Putin an opportunity to strengthen the ties drawing the European Union and the Russian Federation increasingly close together. To this end, President Putin reiterated the need to activate the Permanent Partnership Council, within which and within whose various formats representatives of key areas of EU-Russia cooperation will be able to exchange views and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing himself to strategic considerations, President Putin expressed Moscow’s concerns at the short- and medium-term consequences of enlargement on both economic and trade relations and political relations between the Russian Federation and former Soviet Bloc countries – with particular reference to the Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic states – in view of the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States. In reply to President Putin, we made it quite clear that the extension of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is an obligation with which the Russian Federation must comply within the timeframe laid down and is an essential condition for strengthening its relations with the 25-Member State Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit also looked at the state of progress of the talks for the Russian Federation’s future membership of the WTO which, despite significant unresolved issues, both sides hope will be achieved before the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European and the Russian sides looked forward to the ending of current visa regulations, and noted with satisfaction that talks on the preliminaries for a visa-free system had begun and that the current visa regulations were to be relaxed immediately on a bilateral and, of course, reciprocal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key moments in the Summit was the ceremony of the signing of two agreements: the renewed Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation and the Europol-Russia Agreement on the exchange of strategic analyses and cooperation in police training, which is a tangible sign of the willingness of the Russian Federation to work alongside the European Union in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In constant association with the Commission and the Secretariat, the Italian Presidency put a great deal of effort into the preparations for this event. It was discussed on 28 October at the meeting of the European Union Troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, as well as at a number of meetings of senior officials of the Italian Presidency and the Russian Federation. It was necessary, in particular, to overcome a twofold difficulty. This consisted, on the one hand, of the Russians’ high expectations of a leap forward in their relations with the European Union, and, on the other, of the more rigid position adopted by the majority of Member States with regard to what they see as Moscow’s inadequate commitment to giving practical effect to the political pledges it has made.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because of its joint nature, being the result of a compromise, the Joint Declaration issued at the end of the Summit was achieved only after long, hard negotiations between the Russian Federation, on the one hand, and the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretariat on the other. It thus represents the reconciliation of conflicting demands and is a sensitive compromise between the demands of many of the Member States, which had wanted explicit reference to be made to all the controversial issues, and the desire of the Russians for a very pared-down Declaration limited to highlighting the positive aspects of EU-Russia cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before examining the individual elements of the Summit, I should like to make it clear that all the issues on the agenda were dealt with fully in our talks with President Putin. They included the situation in Chechnya, the failure to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the issue of Moldova and Transnistria and the implications of the judicial proceedings involving the <span class="italic">Yukos </span>group.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Chechnya, in particular, I should like to point out that not only was the issue raised at the initiative of the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, but ample debating time was dedicated to the subject during the plenary session. If there is no mention of this issue in the final Summit Declaration, this is owing to the considerations that I mentioned a short while ago to the effect that this was a proposal on which agreement had to be reached, and thus the fruit of a brokerage exercise. The Commission, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Presidency all agreed that the reference made to the joint declaration was acceptable as an outcome. These, therefore, are the reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of domestic developments in Russia, President Putin described the internal political and economic situation with reference also to the parliamentary elections next December and the presidential elections the following March, and in the light of the events connected with the <span class="italic">Yukos</span> affair. He reiterated Russia’s clear intention to carry on with its privatisation programme and continue with the process of creating an independent judicial system and strengthening the public institutions. We replied that, although we had absolutely no intention of interfering in Russian domestic affairs, we would continue to follow the <span class="italic">Yukos</span> affair very closely, and that we were confident that the Russian judiciary would act with complete transparency and in accordance with the law and would give the international community and the business community its full assurance that the ongoing reforms would not be obstructed, and that Russia would continue to follow the principles of the market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to a specific request from the Presidency, President Putin illustrated the efforts that Moscow is making to begin political and institutional reconstruction in Chechnya by means of a referendum, amnesty and elections, and invited European representatives to visit the region. For our part, we expressed our solidarity with Russia in the fight against Chechen terrorism as well as our support for a constitutional reform that encompasses ever-wider sections of the Chechen population that are not compromised by terrorism. We renewed our appeal for all possible efforts to be made to speed up the release of Arjan Erkel, the <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières </span>representative who was abducted in the Caucasus in August 2002, and expressed the hope that an ECHO office would be opened in the area. President Putin suggested that one could be opened in Chechnya itself, and that he would personally guarantee its security.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the common economic space, the Summit sanctioned an agreed strategy that, we hope, will increase the level of interdependence between our economies in the coming years. We now have to decide upon the appropriate institutional forum for the operational follow-up, perhaps extending the mandate of the relevant High Level Group. The Summit was supportive of Russian aspirations for WTO membership by the end of 2004, but remains well aware of known difficulties in areas such as energy, air transport issues and insurance, which remain outstanding items on the EU-Russia agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue on energy will continue, with the EU continuing to encourage progress in the Russian process of reforming the sector, in spite of the difficulties that Russia has in meeting the demands of Europe and the WTO, especially in relation to domestic prices and the privatisation of the energy sector. The European Union also insisted strongly on the need for Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol with all speed and on our expectation that Russia would make a determined effort to increase cooperation in matters of protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the common space of freedom, security and justice, I should like to draw your attention to the signing of an agreement between Europol and the Russian Ministry of the Interior. This is a significant confirmation of our joint determination to press ahead with implementation of the plan of action against organised crime. In the same context, we were also pleased to record the start of talks at a technical level on issues relating to the liberalisation of visa requirements, and took note of the willingness of both sides to introduce measures to relax the requirements for the issuing of visas under the existing legislation. We also underscored the importance of rapid conclusion of the Readmission Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting gave the European Union the opportunity to confirm its conviction that internal security is complementary to justice and respect for human rights, and that the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia continues to be based on shared values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights and freedom of expression. As regards the common space of external security, the joint declaration on cooperation in the area of crisis management was a clear sign of the willingness of the European Union and the Russian Federation to work together in this area of vital interest for Europe. I believe that this, too, should be recorded as one of the successes of the Rome Summit as regards the creation of a common space of external security. The Russian proposal for closer cooperation in the field of civil protection and the management of natural disasters will be considered in more detail and converted at the earliest possible date into agreements that will enable the Union and Russia to cooperate and strengthen their joint response to future emergencies. An initial step may be the establishment of direct contact between the competent bodies in Brussels and Moscow. The possibility of similar cooperation is also to be explored by the relevant multilateral bodies in relation to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the common space of research and education, the Summit opened a new chapter in bilateral cooperation, which had been bolstered by the Russian Federation’s joining the Bologna Process, an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism promoting agreements in the field of the mutual recognition of academic qualifications and the harmonisation of university curricula. The Bologna Process paves the way for forms of effective intergovernmental cooperation in the field of the harmonisation of academic qualifications, which is an initial step towards the creation of a common space for university teaching. Moreover, the renewal of the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation will make it possible for the Russians to take part in European research programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the question was explored of the functioning of the Permanent Partnership Council, with the aim of finding a solution based on the values of efficiency and flexibility that reconciles Russia’s desire for discussions of greater depth and reach in matters of common interest with the principle that the decision-making processes of the EU must remain autonomous. I hope that, by building on this foundation, we shall soon be able to reach an agreement that will make it possible to put the Permanent Partnership Council into operation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards international issues, in addition to the debates imposed by current events in Iran, Iraq and the Middle East, on which the two sides are in broad agreement and essentially share the same goals, we also raised the question of the situation in Moldova, in particular, on account of a number of imminent deadlines relating to the Transnistria crisis in which the Russian Federation has a crucial role to play: the definitive withdrawal of Russian military hardware by 31 December, and progress in the five-way negotiations and in the work of the Constitutional Committee responsible for drafting a new model of state for Moldova. We believe that Russia should honour its commitment punctually, without any further postponements. Russia confirmed the undertaking to withdraw, but observed that, since the negotiations for the resolution of the Transnistria crisis had made little headway, further endeavours would be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I think I can say that the Rome Summit was not altogether easy but it was an important moment in the consolidation of our overall relationship with the Russian Federation and enabled us to make progress in the creation of the four common spaces. It was certainly a valuable occasion for an extensive exchange of views on international issues.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the preparatory political dialogue for this summit, which took place on 28 October in Moscow, I considered it necessary and right to describe the state of our relations as follows: we have very many action plans but hardly any action. We have grand strategies but small deeds. We have visions but little practice. That is my assessment, and the Russian side agreed with it. The common intent that came out of that preparatory meeting was to become rather more practical in our relations and perhaps to develop fewer great new ideas, but instead to try for once actually to put into practice the ideas we already have. I agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council has already said here. In that respect, the Rome Summit was really almost the beginning of a new form of cooperation because really very precise and clear results were achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the summit in many respects confirmed the complexity of relations between the European Union and Russia. We reaffirmed the interest of both sides in fostering long-term integration by creating a number of common spaces both within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and in the context of the Wider Europe initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important that the concept of the common economic space was given really concrete form at the summit and that the High Level Group was in fact able to make concrete proposals, such as the start of a common programme for the approximation of laws and facilitation of trade. That will now be put into practice very quickly and will be made easier by Russia’s impending accession to the WTO, which we anticipate for 2004. The Commission is very much in favour of Russia joining the WTO, not least in order to drive forward and consolidate economic reform in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have extended the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, seeing it as one of the most important factors for the growth of our cooperation, building on Russia’s significant scientific and research capacities. Russia is also becoming increasingly involved in European Union initiatives to promote cooperation in research and education.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has already drawn attention to the signing of the agreement between Europol and the Russian interior ministry. The Commission welcomes that because it will encourage cooperation in fighting terrorism and organised crime. There will be a joint declaration on cooperation in political and security matters. Those are quite clearly areas of common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also, however, seen that there are things that separate the European Union and Russia today and that there are subjects on which we need to intensify our efforts in order to make progress and arrive at common results. I will begin with environmental problems. It is quite clear that we need to do more to deal with common challenges jointly such as climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the Kyoto Protocol is concerned, I see the situation roughly as follows. It is probably realistic to assume that progress in Russia’s preparation for when it will sign the Kyoto Protocol will run parallel to its progress on joining the WTO. Although there is no formal link, it is quite realistic to think that there will be some parallelism between the two processes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also most important that we should be able to reach agreement on matters of safety for maritime shipping and of nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sees a need for talks concerning Russia’s OSCE obligation to withdraw troops from Transnistria by the end of this year and on extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the acceding Member States. So far as Transnistria in particular is concerned, I think we can expect significantly more pressure from Russia to get OSCE policy implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of <span class="italic">Yukos</span>, the freezing of a large proportion of <span class="italic">Yukos</span> shares has created much instability and uncertainty on financial markets, and the Commission has made clear, both in the political dialogue in Moscow and at the summit in Rome, that the Russian authorities must in every case apply the laws fairly and without discrimination, observing the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Chechnya, we found that the security situation there has deteriorated further since the constitutional referendum in March and the presidential elections in October. The European Union has issued two statements expressing its concern about allegations of ballot rigging. The facts make clear that a political solution to the problem has still not been found. We will continue to press for a more workable political solution, but that will not be possible without full respect for human rights. That also includes those responsible for serious human rights violations being called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">For obvious reasons, the Commission raised the question of humanitarian aid both in the political dialogue and at the summit and noted that humanitarian aid is being hampered by the fact that our personnel are unable to be active on the ground. Talks on this subject have not resulted in a satisfactory outcome as yet. I would like to stress, however, that the Commission still considers it a priority to be present in the region itself with its resources and personnel in order to be able to provide assistance when and where it is needed. We are, after all, the largest provider of humanitarian aid in this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can we draw from all this? Firstly, if we want to build a genuine strategic partnership, the European Union’s policy towards Russia must be balanced and consistent. Selecting topics that are only to the advantage of one partner is not a sufficient basis for a strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also try to ensure that the Member States and the Union as a whole pursue jointly defined objectives. Questions of visa policy and of a readmission agreement that we want to conclude with our partner Russia ought to be discussed as a common objective under the Union’s umbrella. Let me be perfectly clear: I do not think it is helpful when individual Member States pursue their own policies with Russia in these matters before we have a common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, relations between the Union and Russia are of the utmost importance for the future of both partners. We must not allow initiatives that would be to the advantage of both sides, such as extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or cooperation in fighting crime and in environmental matters, to come to grief because of bureaucratic obstacles. It is therefore very important for the European Union and Russia to call the Permanent Partnership Council into being in order to intensify cooperation between respective ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly, we should place particular stress on developing a tailored concept, together with Russia as part of our new neighbourhood policy, which will give expression to the importance of the special relationship and the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia and provide the space to substantially improve and deepen that relationship. I am pleased to be able to say in conclusion that talks have shown that Russia is willing to cooperate in the context of the European Union’s new neighbourhood policy and that we can therefore meaningfully combine our existing strategy with the new neighbourhood policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very clear when we say that we want to seek a strategic partnership with Russia, because we know that relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for peace and stability on our continent in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my fellow Member Arie Oostlander most sincerely for negotiating a text with the other groups. We have here a text from six groups that reflects our opinion. We expressly recognise the progress that Russia has made on the road to democracy, but it is also a sign of partnership that the deficits we see are addressed openly. The President-in-Office has spoken of the elections in Russia, and elections can only take place if society is free from fear. Elections can only take place if people have enough information. Elections can only take place if the political system is fair. Elections can only take place where there is the rule of law. That is where there are deficits. We have reports that Russian citizens are afraid to protest when they find the state behaving wrongly. In our legal order, it is taken for granted that we can protest against any administrative act, at whatever level. That is why it is important for democratic development in Russia and for stability in Russia – stability is unthinkable without freedom, without democracy – that Russia should make progress in making democracy and the rule of law a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Chechnya is an open wound in Europe, not just in Russia. We must insist that the Chechen people are not equated with terrorists or bandits, but that the Chechen people are granted autonomy within the Russian Federation, as is the case with Tatarstan, for example. It would be a tragedy if, in the necessary fight against terrorism in the world – and we are resolutely for the fight against terrorism –, the Chechen people were ultimately to pay the price of terrorism. I say quite calmly, but my words are addressed to the Council and the Commission, that if we hold a summit with Russia and issue a declaration, then the most important topical issue cannot be left out of the official document.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My plea for the future is therefore that we do this, and I expressly acknowledge that the Council Presidency said something about it in its statement of 8 October. However, it is also important that we agree on a common policy and therefore on a formulation when meeting with the Russian president.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the inclusion of Russia in the Bologna process. We need scientific and cultural exchange with Russia to prevent Russia turning away from Europe as it has often done in its history. We want partnership, we want a Russia that is turned towards Europe, and we must include young people in particular here.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge Russia finally to sign and ratify the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia and we promise our future Member States Estonia and Latvia support in that, because their concerns are our concerns, the concerns of the European Union. We call upon Russia finally to take the necessary steps.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to be Russia’s partner, and if we criticise one thing or another, we do so because we want to see democracy made a reality in Russia and because we want to live in peace, friendship and partnership with the Russian people.</p>

Russian culture is perhaps Russia’s greatest asset, and yet we know little about it. It is a major asset for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is worried by the situation in Chechnya, and it does not seem to be improving. We are in favour of the political solution that Moscow also supports, but the results still seem poor. We fear a civil war and that the conflict will spread outside Chechnya, to a region where there are already any number of good reasons for a conflict. We want the Russians to know that this is harming the development of relations between us and that is a big issue. We demand the implementation of human rights. Should there not be a joint Chechnya conference? We need aid organisations here quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know very much about the <span class="italic">Yukos</span> case, at least not everything, but the method of arrest gives cause for alarm. What we think is important is that laws are obeyed and that openness, which is vital, is practised, but, of course, we know that there is a lot of shady business going on in the transfer of Soviet property into the hands of just a few and crimes have been committed.</p>
<p class="contents">Membership of the World Trade Organisation is very important, as is acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol. Both these will help not just Russia’s development but the growth of its democracy. We also need cooperation on energy; that is the toughest sort of cooperation and the most important. In my opinion, we should combine our transport, telecommunications and energy networks with theirs. This would be the deed of the decade and would create a solid basis for cooperation between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Putin's westward-looking government has described the European Union as its 'natural political partner', and until recently Russia has appeared to dress in the clothes of Europe: the clothes of free trade, the clothes of political and civil rights, the clothes of infant democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group welcomed this EU-Russia summit. We are right to look for political and economic spaces where our two societies can work together. Under the right circumstances, we welcome closer economic relations between the European Union and Russia. Easier travel is a necessary and important part of making this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia and the Union share a common security environment and a high degree of mutual interdependence, so we are right to seek to make our joint borders more secure and our shared hemisphere more safe. We welcome Russia's ambitions to join the WTO and this may be possible, even if it is made more difficult by recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Europe is right to rail against Russian repression and governmental meddling in the lives of its neighbours. The issue of Chechnya will not go away, nor will Russia's refusal to ratify Kyoto. It is not enough to wear the clothes of Europe. Closer relations should carry the price of full subscription to modern European values, and at the very least we must continue to be critical and frank.</p>
<p class="contents">At this summit, Mr President-in-Office, our position was badly compromised by those charged with representing us. The presidency's ill-considered comments on Chechnya and on the arrest and detention of Mikhail Khodorkovsky were out of line. Mr Berlusconi speaks for Europe and he should choose his words with care. His own presidency drafted a declaration last month that was strongly critical of Russian conduct in Chechnya. However, not only was there no reference to Chechnya in the summit communiqué, but the President of the Council even thought it appropriate to contradict Europe's affirmed position with an improvised display of bluster worthy of a cheap lawyer. In any case, why should we deny the difficulties of the Russian minorities in the Baltic states? They are nothing compared to the persecution of the Chechens.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal security may be complementary to justice and human rights, as the President-in-Office said, but as practised in Chechnya it is not. We have condemned Russian action in Chechnya and the attempt to intimidate sources of political opposition in Russia for good reason. Despite their European clothes, it is not clear that Mr Putin's government shares our values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of expression. If it does, why is Mr Khodorkovsky in jail? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in a sense, a response to the declarations issued by Mr Berlusconi on Chechnya at the end of the summit, declarations that justified the Russian policy of military intervention in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Such statements do not reflect the positions agreed by the Fifteen, and my group vigorously condemns these declarations. Europe has expressed its disagreement with this justification, but can that be considered enough? I do not think so. I deplore the very relative importance accorded by the Council and the Commission to the issue of Chechnya, as well as the lukewarm nature of the condemnations of the Kremlin during the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Daily life in Chechnya is still an ordeal for the civilian population. Lack of security, disappearances and human rights violations for which the Russian military forces are responsible continue with complete impunity. Over and over again, Moscow uses the fight against terrorism as an argument for justifying everything. That is unacceptable, even if it is, of course, necessary strongly to condemn the attacks by groups of Chechen extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the independent NGO observers, the would-be democratic election held on 5 October was a sham. My group questions the legitimacy of such a consultation, aimed solely at convincing the international community that the situation in the region has been normalised and that the people have been able to exercise their sovereignty. In fact, there is no such sovereignty. It is a matter of urgency that the EU should finally condemn Russia, clearly and in no uncertain terms, for its handling of the war in Chechnya. It will not be possible for the reconstruction of this wounded country to begin until after the Russian forces have withdrawn and full peace has been brought to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Only genuine political negotiations may enable the way to be opened to a process of democratisation and reconstruction, in which Europe must play a major role by exercising much stronger pressure upon Russia. Why not in the framework of the partnership agreements? Another possibility might consist in supporting the UN’s provisional administration plan in Chechnya. Such an attitude should not be interpreted as going against Russia or the development of the partnership between the European Union and Russia but, instead, as placing ourselves at the service of a peace and security awaited by both peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the time, we were very pleased about the democratic development under Mr Yeltsin, and we obviously did not see the unbelievable corruption developing in Russia. Today, we are very pleased about the advances under Mr Putin, and we do not see the deliberate farce of the media monopoly. I shall not for the moment talk about the arbitrary arrests and of Chechnya, to both of which I shall return at the end of my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are matters like this? Because the fact is that Russia is a huge power at our borders, and no one knows exactly how to take the bull by the horns, all the more so because everyone wants to have Russia on its side. Mr Poettering, I know it is difficult to criticise one’s friends when they make mistakes. You knew, moreover, how it pained me to see my Foreign Minister constantly beside Mr Putin defending a just position concerning Iraq. In other words, the Chechens were sacrificed for Iraq. On the other hand, it is obvious that the Americans were doing exactly the same thing. If the Americans said ‘yes’ to Iraq, it is because the Chechens no longer interested them either. It is therefore the same situation on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a fundamental problem here. If we believe – on the pretext that we need, as indeed we do, a strategic link with the Russians – that we have to indulge them, then we are mistaken. We are mistaken, moreover, because the results will never be commensurate with what we expect. We say ‘yes’ to the democratic process in Russia, but when extremely significant problems arise and the President in charge of Europe is happy to say to Mr Putin, ‘But what you are doing in Chechnya is fine; your arresting people is not a problem; as for the media monopoly, that too is fine’, then the evil has been done, notwithstanding the host of resolutions you may subsequently produce. Moreover, the evil has been done for a long time to come, because no one in Russia will dream of saying, ‘Yes, that is true. There is the European Parliament. Yes, that is true, there is Mr Verheugen and the Commission’. These things do not count, because they know that, when problems arise, the need to manage them will carry the day. ‘We need you, Mr Putin.’</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, any fuss made by Parliament and the Commission does not bother them, which means that, when it comes down to it, the situation in Russia will not change. That is why I tell you that, if we do not clearly denounce the massacre of a whole people that is being organised in Chechnya, Mr Putin will never listen to us. When Mr Putin moralises, perhaps with good reason, about Iraq, he does not think about what we are saying, because it is of no consequence to him. He is using Iraq as a tool, as he needs to use everything as a tool, in order to establish his power in Russia: a totalitarian power.</p>

In it, Parliament has asked the Council and the Commission once again to take the fate of Arjan Erkel, the abducted staff member of <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span>, to heart. His father has visited me, and many other fellow MEPs, here in Strasbourg. Let us put ourselves in his heartrending situation. I have three children of my own. This is why I am totally behind Parliament’s urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to emphatically urge the Russian authorities to provide a clarification of this long-lasting abduction, which has now lasted for more than 460 days, and to sort this matter out.</p>
<p class="contents">Last night, an authoritative Dutch paper reported that in the Council meeting of the Foreign Ministers, some harsh words were being exchanged about the Italian Presidency protecting President Putin. I am very pleased to hear it. I also welcome the newspaper report to the effect that the Council has agreed to Commissioner Patten’s proposal to set down in writing an unambiguous policy for the EU’s relations with the Russian Federation. Needless to say, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am highly intrigued by the way in which the Council mandates the European Commission to make a recommendation to it concerning EU-Russia relations. Does the Commission have any idea when we can look forward to its ideas taking effect?</p>
<p class="contents">One thing with regard to the Chechen tragedy is evident: on no account can this be described as providing a basis for common values shared by the European Union and Russia. Similarly, the <span class="italic">Yukos</span> case is causing us great concern. When high representatives of the European Institutions attempt to cover up, or even justify, these two situations, they encourage the Kremlin to follow the wrong political course. This does not at all serve the interests of Russian society, or those of the European Union, for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Moscow should not be left in any doubt about what Brussels exactly stands for in the mutual relationship, including where the European Union has its priorities: a good neighbourly relationship which presupposes joint action with regard to problems such as cross-border crime, nuclear risks and illegal migration; the promotion of human rights and the constitutional state, as well as urgent improvement of the nigh hopeless situation in Chechnya; joint action with regard to so-called ‘frozen conflicts’ in the southern Caucasus and a solution to the issue of Transnistria; deepening and broadening complementary trade and economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">True European commitment should be met by Russian reciprocity. Putin and his cronies will therefore need to abandon the traditional attitude of wanting to operate both within and outside of the partnership. You cannot be in it and out of it at the same time. This should, above all, be the clear message from Brussels to Moscow at this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, from a strategic viewpoint, how could we not recognise that it is in the vital interests of the Russian Federation, a country that we all regard as an essential partner for the European Union, to stabilise a region that is crucial as regards access to the oil from the Caucasus? It is certainly no coincidence that the Chechen guerrillas’ primary target is not Russian military posts but the infrastructure of the oil industry. It is fair to ask, therefore, what interests, apart from ethno-religious motives, lie behind Chechen terrorism and what drives them on. Should we not think about the danger posed by the constantly smouldering fuse of the most aggressive and extremist armed factions of international Islamic fundamentalism? Is it or is it not true that, in November 1998 in Islamabad, the eighteenth assembly of the Islamic Group of Pakistan indicated Chechnya as one of the main axes for the worldwide <span class="italic">jihad</span>, together with other areas like Kosovo?</p>
<p class="contents">As for human rights, I would remind you that one need only download the images disseminated throughout the world by Osama bin Laden’s networks from the Internet to see the severed heads of Russian soldiers. This, too, is a matter of human rights, if I am not mistaken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can one not defend the right of the Chechen people to express their own opinion? That is why I stand behind the words of the President-in-Office of the Council and support the position of the European People’s Party. Nevertheless, although I endorse the general thrust of the compromise resolution on which this House is to vote tomorrow, I cannot agree on one point, where it gives a specious and inaccurate interpretation of the position expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union – something that a few Members have also done in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is not what is maintained in this report; the truth is not what Mr Watson has said or what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said; the truth is what the GUE/NGL Members have said. I refer back to the well-known press conference that has been mentioned, because it is only fair that we should also remember what the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Putin, said, to the effect that during the talks, the awkward questions and the doubts about our policy came from Mr Berlusconi himself. This was written by an agency that is certainly not in line with the government’s positions. The press agencies still maintain that it was the Italian Prime Minister who raised the Chechen question. I therefore believe that what happened at the summit should be interpreted very carefully and accurately, especially the spirit and willingness that characterised the efforts of the current Presidency of the European Union. Any other interpretation will be open to use for political ends, especially within Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only talk to President Putin about advancing the partnership between the European Union and Russia on the basis of these three premises. For this reason, we strongly support the criticism contained in the resolution on which Parliament will vote tomorrow directed at the current President-in-Office of the European Union, for the inadmissible statements made by Mr Berlusconi supporting Mr Putin’s policy in Chechnya. These statements – and I am addressing the under-secretary, Mr Antonione – were utterly unacceptable and totally devoid of any connection with the policy expressed by the European Union up to now. As Mr Poettering has reminded us, the European Union regards Chechnya as an open wound. Mr Berlusconi’s affinities and personal friendships cannot and must not jeopardise the rigor with which Europe must demand that President Putin put an immediate end to the abuses and violence in Chechnya and seek a political solution to that conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, 3000 deaths since the beginning of the year, 300 people missing, 50 mass graves discovered and elections known to be a farce: this is the balance of the war in Chechnya, and a story of long-standing impunity: the Italian Presidency really ought to call President Putin to account over this. We would have expected some words of regret from Mr Antonione about what has happened and some plain speaking about what will happen in future. We note, Mr President, that these words have not yet come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are seeking integration and a peaceful Europe, we will not be able to do it without, let alone against, Russia. Russia is and will remain an important political, economic and military factor in the world. We need cooperation, not confrontation. Russia could be an even more effective strategic partner and good neighbour if the EU states would look beyond supplies of oil and natural gas and if the EU would do more to help strengthen economic and social stability, which are essential if democracy is to take shape and develop in a country.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of Chechnya is a serious one, but there is only a political solution and we ought to show more commitment in achieving one. If the USA has a strategic interest in maintaining tension on Russia’s southern borders, that is its own affair. It cannot be in the interests of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are criticising – and our criticisms are directed at both the Council and the Commission, which have both been pressing ahead with the same policy – is an uncritical policy towards Russia, a thoroughly blind policy that does not see the decline in the freedom of the press, which does not see the decline in the independence of the judiciary – the case of Mr Khordokovsky is a clear example – a policy that pretends that a little country called Chechnya just does not exist. Has there not been a massacre in Chechnya? Two hundred and fifty thousand people – how often do we have to say this? – out of one million people equals extermination and something very close to genocide. This is not tolerable; it is not tolerable that the Commission has not had the courage to send its Commissioner for humanitarian aid to Chechnya and that Mr Prodi has not been there either. There is something I must say, and I hope Mr Antonione will pass it on to Mr Berlusconi: it is unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi should call that a myth, and I think many in this Parliament and in the European Union expect Mr Berlusconi to correct what he has said when he comes to this House during the next part-session in December. What is at stake is the dignity of the dead and of those who are still alive in Chechnya, and the dignity of this Parliament and of the whole European Union and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future, we can do what we did for Yugoslavia: pretend that the Caucasus issue does not exist. The Chechnya problem is a colonial problem and must be resolved as such. What is happening in Chechnya is infinitely worse than what was done in Algeria and in so many other countries in Africa. The way forward, then, is for Chechnya to join the European Union, and for Georgia, which is another strategic part of the European Union, to join too. This should be the programme carried forward by the Commission and the Council.</p>

This translates, on the one hand, into cooperation, where possible, across the board, particularly in all the areas where it can help bring about the cultural change in Russia in order to move towards a constitutional state and more democratic relations. This also, however, entails criticism, where necessary. This is why we must state our opinions in no uncertain terms. This policy, therefore, embraces not just one, but both elements. Listening to the President-in-Office of the Council, I have to say that we in this House have already achieved many of the things he lists, and now they are again included in the resolution. Why is it that you now sound so very different from what we remember from the summit? What strikes me in particular, is that you have specifically mentioned Moldova, and the timeframe for the withdrawal of the troops. You have also spoken about Arjan Erkel. I am very indebted to you for raising this issue and bringing it here today. That is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">From the press and your statement, however, it seems that Chechnya has not been given much attention. You have given a justification for this. Yet, this is very dangerous, for the public at large is interested in your summit meetings and wants to know what is on the agenda, whether the ideals and values of our European citizens have been mentioned and have determined your conduct. This is why I would have preferred what you have stated here to also have been included in your statement. We would probably also have responded in a slightly different way.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I find the Commissioner’s approach very clear. For a very long time, the Russians have insisted on a very specific and practical approach, preferring cash on the nail to grand ideas. I think that the Russians are right in this, and that we, while continuing to adopt our two-track policy, can tackle very specific issues, particularly in the area of contacts among scientists. Cooperation with Russia in that field has not always been easy. In my opinion, however, this scientific cooperation is extremely important in the light of Russia’s cultural change.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, therefore, that the Council will continue along these lines and that the impression that has been created by a few personal remarks will soon change, for otherwise your presidency will be placed in a bad light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has happened since then? The FSB secret service, the successor to the KGB and which Mr Putin once ran, is now three times larger than when President Putin came to office. Politics has been increasingly neutralised. The same is true of the media. There are hardly any really independent large media left. Now it seems to be the turn of business, to judge by the goings on surrounding the so-called oligarchies. Those are serious danger signals in Russia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at Chechnya, we find that in 1999 Mr Putin unleashed the second Chechen war of the post-Soviet era, part of the most bloody election campaign in recent history, or in history at all. This war has seen hundreds of thousands driven from their homes in Chechnya and tens of thousands murdered. Many speak of almost one fifth of the Chechen population. That would be as many as under Josef Stalin. These are not trivialities, they are very serious events and Europe needs to be concerned with them, especially when an important partner is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that Russia cannot develop a Swiss democracy over night. But Russia has set strict criteria for itself. It has joined the Council of Europe. It has entered into a special partnership with the European Union. That means it has itself agreed to be judged by democratic standards and the rule of law and it must try to live up to those standards, but I fear it has increasingly failed to do so over the last few years. Of course things are better today than in the days of totalitarianism, but we are currently witnessing a trend not to more but to less democracy and rule of law, as Yelena Bonner, the widow of our prize-winner Andrei Sacharov, has made clear.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Chechnya is concerned, President-in-Office, I have only one thing to say: you are confining the Chechnya problem too much to the subject of terrorism. The Italian word for what is essentially going on in Chechnya is not <span class="italic">terrorismo</span> but <span class="italic">resistenza</span>.</p>
