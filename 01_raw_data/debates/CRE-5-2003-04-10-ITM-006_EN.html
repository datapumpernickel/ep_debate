I am very glad that this issue is on today's agenda. I worked, for a time, as a doctor in Guatemala, and myself became familiar with the situation in that country. The greatest problem in Guatemala was then – and still is – the extreme disparity between wealth and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Being a Christian Democrat, I certainly am not among those who leap to the defence of tax increases. In Europe and in my own country too, taxes are certainly too high, but the situation in Guatemala is that the rich simply do not see themselves as being under any obligation to contribute to the country's development. That is why we have incorporated into the Joint Resolution a passage intended to ensure that the necessary adjustments are made, as it is necessary also to draw upon the financial resources of the wealthy in a given country for such purposes as the improvement of its educational systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of land and of the way in which it is shared out is without doubt a key to future development in Guatemala and in its neighbouring countries, and, at the end of 2002, MEPs belonging to different groups organised a conference on the subject. What I learned from this conference was that it is possible to reach the same objective without resorting to inflammatory language, and for that reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has not used the term ‘agricultural reform’, opting instead for an expression that, although rather more unwieldy, has found its way into the Joint Resolution, simply in order to avoid provoking counter-reactions that would then get us no nearer our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is very important – and I am glad that it has been incorporated into the Joint Resolution – is that any policy must have education and training as one of its basic components. It is no use simply giving people a plot of land; they also have to know how to cultivate it. Taken as a whole, the Joint Resolution is an even-handed compromise, and it is out of conviction that we support it.</p>

We are after all convinced that the extreme poverty of the rural population that has to make a living from survival agriculture makes this the poorest population in the world. The rural population, which in Guatemala largely consists of the indigenous population, is unfortunately no exception to this. That is why it is of the utmost importance that each of the sentences in this resolution is considered very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the time to go into each of these aspects in depth, but it is clear that in these circumstances land reform is necessary, even if that word is taboo. It is the indigenous population that is clearly suffering most and that has no access to healthy food, that has no access to a good education and that has no access to land. The women are the biggest victims of all because they simply do not count, although in many cases it is they who have to provide alone for very large, extended families.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a wave of human rights violations at the moment and people in the country are acting with complete impunity. In these circumstances there are good reasons to recall the ratification of membership of the International Criminal Court and we would also like to insist on the abolition of the death penalty. All this to underline that just one of the countries for which we had some hope a few years ago is threatening to slip back into a state of impunity again, the agreements of 1996 remaining a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">We donate quite a lot of money to cooperation with these countries in Latin America. Let us ensure that our international agreements, which come down to our aid and our cooperation having first to be for the benefit of the poorest, actually make this possible and that the government is obliged to lend its assistance in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, MINUGUA, the United Nations Mission to Guatemala admits the agreements are stalled. Regression has even been noted in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Liese rightly pointed out, the House has been addressed by small farmers from Guatemala and by representatives of the institutions in that country. It was stated clearly that some of this regression involved the murder of small farmers or threats against them. The rights of the indigenous people are again being violated. The judiciary lacks the means to administer justice. Even the National Coordinator for indigenous peoples and small farmers has denounced the lack of security regarding land.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore requested to ensure that the peace agreements are put firmly back on track when the next advisory group meeting is held in May of this year. Renewed effort is called for on the part of the European Commission to promote the peace agreements. This is especially urgent in certain basic areas such as the fight against impunity, appropriate fiscal reform and the fight against poverty. More work is also needed on land distribution, together with a law on registration and land registry information. These were the main points agreed during the seminar Mr Liese mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recent history shows us that, ever since the murder, in the seventies, of the German ambassador Graf Spreti, who was a diplomat and politician of note, this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another, to which any response came too late. We were always too late in responding to the bloody acts of violence, to the revolutions, and to the terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">So I thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken the initiative in putting forward this masterpiece of pre-emptive diplomacy, a brief resolution which, for the first time, is not a reaction to a crisis of the sort with which we are familiar in our debates on topical and urgent matters – although there is of course an acute crisis going on. Primarily, though, this is about prevention, and, moreover, prevention through action rather than through words.</p>
<p class="contents">It gets right to the core issues, these being the whole area of agriculture and the reforms that it needs. Secondly, it turns to economic reform and the area of fiscal legislation, which really is bizarre. The crucial thing is that it also embeds the peace process, to which the European Union can make a substantial contribution by supporting and setting up dialogue, as well, of course, as in the field of economic cooperation and development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful for this initiative. It is my belief that the real task of this House is not always to merely condemn, but to actively endeavour to devise strategies for minimising disasters, or averting them completely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have been forced to follow the path of armed conflict in order to defend their fundamental rights. Their tough fight resulted in the peace process and the government which emerged promised to promote certain reforms which would give the descendents of the Maya and other local civilisations some relief.</p>
<p class="contents">Now six years on, and still no progress has been made with these reforms; on the contrary, poverty rules, especially among the natives, who make up the majority of the population. Employment rights are being trampled underfoot, the remnants of feudalism are being maintained, farmers are being turned off the land they cultivate and their leaders are being murdered by the paramilitary, who enjoy impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn the government of Guatemala, the oligarchy and foreign intervention. We stand by the grass-roots forces of the country and are certain that their fight for democratic and social change will bear fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this is an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring very closely the situation in Guatemala, where, as a number of speakers have said this afternoon, mounting infringements of the rule of law and human rights, as well as the deepening polarisation within Guatemalan society, are causing increasing political and social tension on the eve of the 2003 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, difficult access to food, extreme poverty and social protest are increasingly alarming issues. Within this unfortunate and unhappy scenario, in line with the resolution on Guatemala that the European Parliament issued in April 2002, the Commission is reinforcing the political dialogue and cooperation initiatives. Our objective is to encourage the Guatemalan institutions and society to relaunch a national agenda based on the peace accords, good governance and the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the political dialogue, the Commission and the Member States constantly remind the Guatemalan public institutions of the importance of respecting the dignity and securing the wellbeing of all Guatemalan people on the basis of the principles of democracy, equality, non-discrimination and social justice. During the last months, the Commission has also participated in various EU actions to transmit to the Supreme Court of Justice and the local authorities our preoccupation about the increasing wave of threats, attacks and violence in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 2002 the Commission adopted a strategy for cooperation with Guatemala during the period 2002 to 2006. That strategy is aimed at sustaining the peace accords and breaking the cycle of poverty and exclusion that affects the country. The strategy was established with the large-scale participation of the Guatemalan Government, Member States and local and European civil society. It will focus on three main areas: first, consolidation of the rule of law and protection of human rights; secondly, local and rural development based on participation, inclusion and equity; and thirdly, equitable economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicative financial resources are EUR 93 million for the period 2002 to 2006. It is also worth mentioning that Guatemala is a priority country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament will know, there will be a further Consultative Group meeting scheduled in Guatemala City for 13 and 14 May 2003. At that meeting the Commission and Member States will urge the Guatemalan authorities and society to renew efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Peace Agenda signed in 1996, especially in those areas where unsatisfactory results have been registered so far, such as the justice system, rural development, and the situation of the indigenous people. We shall also ask for the allocation of adequate budgetary resources for social expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission stands ready to support Guatemala in monitoring the next electoral process and guaranteeing a transparent and democratic transfer of power – as it did for the last elections in 1999. During his visit to Brussels in January 2003 Minister Gutiérrez, asked for the support of the European Union. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has also asked for our support. The Commission and Member States will decide whether to prepare an EU electoral observation mission on the basis of an exploratory mission that will be sent in May 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
