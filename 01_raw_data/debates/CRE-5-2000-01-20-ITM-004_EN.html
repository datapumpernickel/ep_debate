<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turmes (Greens/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, why do we need a European directive on efficiency for fluorescent lighting? We use 130 million such lights in the 15 Member States of the EU every year, especially in office buildings, where two-thirds of the light is currently provided by fluorescent lighting. Following on from the Rio Conference in 1992, the EU Commission carried out a study into what specific steps could be introduced in our countries in order to protect the climate. It emerged that one of the cheapest measures in the EU would be to increase the efficiency of fluorescent lighting. These lights are on for ten hours a day, five to seven days a week, 50 weeks of the year for several years, meaning that even a slight improvement in efficiency of just three or five watts would make a huge difference to energy consumption over the years. The EU Commission started negotiations with CELMA, the association which represents manufacturers of lighting systems and, in 1996, it drafted a study in order to have a scientific basis for a decision. This 1996 study took account of several scenarios. The most efficient scenario, where all magnetic ballasts would be withdrawn at some point from the market and the best available technology, i.e. electronic ballasts, which already account for 20% of the market, would, at some point, supply the entire market, would mean savings of 250 terawatt hours, i.e. 250 billion kilowatt hours throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am from Luxembourg. The entire consumption of electricity in Luxembourg, for industry, residential customers and office buildings, is 6 terawatt hours per annum. In other words, this directive would enable us to save twice the entire electricity consumption of Luxembourg. In other words, it is not quite as irrelevant as it might appear at first glance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission presented a proposal in 1999. This proposal falls below the minimum scenario in the study which it itself commissioned in 1996. That is because not all magnetic ballasts will be phased out consistently; some would remain on the market, and we would save 100 billion kilowatt hours less over coming years. Parliament therefore needs to improve the Commission’s proposal. There are ecological arguments which I have already mentioned. There is also a technical and financial argument. The industry itself has tried to use the Commission’s present paper to estimate what investment signals are being given to the ballast market. It has ascertained that, in 5-8 years’ time, 50% of ballasts would be the best magnetic ballasts, i.e. we are actually sending the market the wrong signal. Instead of ensuring that all investments are channelled into the best available technology, i.e. electronic ballasts, a large part of the investments would only go to the second best technology.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is not hard to imagine that, if the industry invests in the second best technology over the next 3-4 years, it will object even more in 5-6 years, when we undertake a review, than it does today to reversing investments which it has only just made.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on the international background: the USA plans to phase out all magnetic ballasts by 2010. Our proposal, and here I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other parties, Mrs McNally, Mr Rovsing and Mr Beysen, would simply be adopting what is already on the agenda in the USA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful for the constructive cooperation between the Groups, in which we have reached compromises I find to be responsible, apposite and to the point. We therefore support these in our Group. </p>
<p class="contents">Why are we concerning ourselves with this issue? To put it very briefly, it is a question of limiting man-made carbon dioxide emissions. We know that, as Asia obtains a higher standard of living, 1.4 billion Chinese and 1 billion Indians will begin to use more and more energy, and this means that, when they begin to demand ordinary basic comforts such as warm water and perhaps air conditioning, means of transport and modern industry, their consumption of energy will rise dramatically from its present figure of 10% of the EU’s average energy consumption. In Rio, we undertook to protect the climate. The present document completely fulfils this purpose. We note that, of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, 30% come from electricity generation and 35% of all energy used in the EU is obtained from electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, strip lights account for 53% of electricity used for lighting and, if we succeed in implementing what we have planned, we shall, by the year 2020, be preventing six million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. We shall conserve 10% of the electricity consumed by strip lighting and, converted into cash, this will be a saving of EUR 250 million per year. The present proposal will therefore have quite a significant impact on the climate and on the economy and, by implementing it as suggested, we shall be giving our industry a long time in which to make the changeover. Mr Turmes was in favour of this, and I would remind you that industry has, in any case, known since 1992 that, by approximately the year 2009, magnetic ballasts would be more or less prohibited. There is therefore nothing new in what we are doing. </p>
<p class="contents">In the compromise we have prepared, we have been united on the issue of increasing energy efficiency. We wished to protect the climate. We wished to achieve economic advantages, and we wished to be sure that, in phasing out certain uses of energy, we did not unnecessarily burden ordinary consumers in ordinary homes with making investments on which there can be no return. At the same time, we have ensured that we in the northern part of the Union – in northern Finland, northern Sweden, northern Norway, Greenland and other places – where electronic ballasts are no use, may continue to use magnetic ballasts. This is, all in all, a splendid proposal, and I recommend that we all give it our backing and support in the form in which it was agreed in the Groups.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am glad that this debate is proving educational and enlightening for you. Sometimes debates are not exciting; it is much more interesting to talk about dramatic weather conditions and storms in France. But if we want to stop events like that, this is the sort of detailed technical work we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Turmes for his very thorough work, his technical expertise and his willingness to engage in proper discussions on compromise with Members from other groups. That is appreciated, and I think it is the responsible way we should work in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take our Kyoto and other obligations seriously and want to prevent tragic weather events, we have to work with some sense of urgency. It is eight years since negotiations with the industry concerned and with energy experts began, on ways in which we could use the lighting sector to save electricity. There are many reasons for doing that. It is an extremely sensible investment for businesses within the European Union to have energy efficient lighting.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to have an internal market without unjustified, obstructive trade barriers. Our enterprises throughout the single market have to work in the same conditions; there has to be the famous level playing-field, always bearing in mind particular national concerns and circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Electricity, the Commission reminds us, accounts for 35% of our total primary energy use and produces 30% of our man-made carbon dioxide emissions. Tackling that sector, as well as the transport sector, is essential. It is very appropriate therefore that we look at minimum efficiency standards in any area which uses electricity. We have looked successfully at domestic boilers and industrial boilers, at fridges and freezers and we have some voluntary agreements – about which I might have reservations – in other household appliance sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can quote from a study carried out in the United Kingdom at our very well known Building Research Centre: "the production of performance standards, particularly for fluorescent lamp ballasts, appears from this study to be one of the most effective actions which the EC could take to reduce energy consumption for lighting in commercial buildings and is thus worth further consideration and development." That very highly esteemed research establishment decided this was a sector we should work on.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem is that those who buy lights are not necessarily those who use them. Those who invest in buildings are not the people who will pay the electricity bills in future years. The huge numbers of lights, however, mean that we have to look to ensure that those purchasers have to make sensible purchases, by ensuring that what is on the market meets the highest possible standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are only talking of newly produced fluorescent lighting ballasts. We are not suggesting that every single one has to be replaced tomorrow or next week. That would be an absurd way to carry on. We are suggesting that, in a very phased, measured and well-considered way, as the current lights in use are replaced, over the next 15-20 years, they are replaced with the best possible technology. A very long adaptation period, that is how we work in the European Union. We do not jump on our enterprises with surprise packages about which they have no warning and which would cause them considerable difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Turmes has indeed been reasonable. The 800 people employed in manufacturing magnetic ballasts will not lose their jobs next week. There will be plenty of time for a phase-in period.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group are against the additional amendments which have been submitted. They are not in line with the aims of the report. But we support those amendments which we signed as part of the compromise, many of which add, as I am sure the Commissioner would agree, sensible definitions. I hope the Commissioner will tell us that this is only part of her aim to increase energy efficiency within the European Union and make our promises more than mere political headlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To my mind, however, this report has a far greater scope, as has been, in fact, already highlighted by the Members. On the one hand, it is the first report of the new millennium that will contribute to the more economical use of energy, and nobody will dispute the fact that our planet’s chances of survival in this new millennium will largely depend on how we handle energy in future. This is why one cannot afford to gloss over this initiative. On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the way in which this report came about, following consultation with the industry involved, as well as politicians and the Commission, is a good example of what the French would term ‘<span class="italic">cohabitation’</span>. By this, I mean that the deliberations and round-table discussions which preceded the draft directive have led to a consensus between industry and the Commission. The report, as it is now presented, is also the result of compromise amendments approved by the key political groups and I subscribe to what the previous speaker, Mrs McNally, has said, that it is a working method which should be applied more often in future. </p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments make particular provision for long transitional periods. What it comes down to is that industry has nearly ten years left in order to carry out the necessary adjustments. Moreover, add to this the fact that industry has been aware that changes were inevitable since 1992. It is also interesting to know that the magnetic pre-selection device will not have to be phased out completely until 2009. The importance of this report, Mr President, lies in the fact that it highlights the significant impact this directive has on the employment of thousands of employees, as well as concerns regarding distorting competition policy. Indeed, if the transitional periods were too short, it is clear that not only an entire production line would be at risk, but also the manufacturer, as the latter would not be able to adapt the production line in time. Needless to say, it is our aim to consult all parties involved in the implementation of this report on a regular basis, so that those who have so far opposed the phasing out of the pre-selection device are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the development process. By weighing up the different interests and by working together closely with different interested parties, Parliament has succeeded in delivering a clear and well-founded piece of legislation. I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Turmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has worked hard to discover the effects of energy policies in the report but, at the same time, has paid insufficient attention to the fact that if the recommendations in the report were adopted the result for Europe would be unemployment, mostly in Germany, but also in Finland, Austria, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Fluorescent lighting uses two types of reactor, which have an effect on energy efficiency. Magnetic reactors produce a lot of light and heat. In northern countries this heat conserves heat energy and is not just wasted. Electronic reactors produce more light and less heat, and they are clearly superior to magnetic reactors from the point of view of energy efficiency. Theirs will be the future if they can be made as economically competitive as magnetic reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">Philips has certainly quite rightly invested in this sort of technology. Its products, however, should not be the only ones to be recognised as European standards through political pressure. Mr Turmes in his report proposes banning magnetic reactors in fluorescent lighting, unlike the Commission or the Council. If the report were adopted, Parliament’s position would destroy the industry as far as Europe is concerned. Elsewhere in the world they would certainly manufacture and use magnetic reactors, which are necessary in the sort of natural environment that I come from. Only magnetic reactors can be used in the cold and damp. The production of magnetic reactors would move from Europe to the developing countries, as a result of the ban. The USA has already experienced this.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to keep jobs in Europe, Mr Turmes’ report cannot be adopted with regard to the amendments made by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza. The production costs relating to electronic reactors are many times those of the magnetic ones, and the conservation of nature should also be examined from the point of view of the use and recycling of materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing with the matter of ballast in fluorescent tubes. Now what does this actually mean? The electric current in fluorescent lamps, such as those providing the lighting above our heads, is regulated and stabilised by small devices called ballasts. For fifty years, these ballasts have been made from a copper coil in a sheet metal box. They are called “ferromagnetic ballasts”. Nowadays, however, we have electronic ballasts.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional ferromagnetic ballasts are said to entail a certain loss of energy, particularly due to resistance. The loss would be up to 8 watts an hour, whereas the electronic ones would lose only 3 watts. They would therefore allow for a saving of 5 watts and, multiplying that by 130 million ballasts, you would save millions of tonnes of energy, there would be less CO2, the greenhouse effect would be reduced and mankind would breathe more easily. Consequently, in eight years time, we would have to abandon ferromagnetic ballasts in favour of electronic ballasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Turmes does not tell us that the electronic ballast has a shorter service life than the ferromagnetic one. Therefore, more of them will have to be manufactured, with more energy consumed and the savings just mentioned will partly disappear. Furthermore, these electronic ballasts are made with transistors that contain heavy metals, such as tantalum, germanium, and even arsenic, not to mention plastic, that is to say, non-biodegradable pollutants, whereas the copper and sheet metal of the ferromagnetic ballasts are biodegradable. In other words, for a saving of energy that is not as clear cut as it seems, our Green colleagues are prepared to release heavy metals and arsenic into the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in addition to increasing pollution, unemployment will increase because the components used in the manufacture of the electronic ballasts and the machines that make them are not European. So, in order to avoid import costs, our manufacturers are going to relocate and thus reduce the number of jobs. In the final analysis, in wishing to make a modest saving of energy by using electronic ballasts, at a time when our manufacturers are demanding simply a gradual and selective ban, what we have at best is a saving but also the release of pollutants and increased unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are we tackling the real problem of waste, that is to say, incandescent lamps that show losses of up to 50 watts in comparison with fluorescent lamps. But it is true that incandescent lamps are manufactured by two multinationals, Philips and Osram. And so maybe there is a connection between the internationalists of the European Commission, the internationalists of the nebulous green multinational and the transnationals of industry, but I am not asking that we shed light on the whole business.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this chamber is a model of how neon tubes and ballasts can work together. I am sure that we have the economical bulbs because it has also been proven that electronic ballasts pay for themselves within one to two years. We therefore have a very good return on investment, which is why all modern building constructors and planners are already changing over to these electronic ballasts. At the moment, the market cannot produce enough ballasts to meet requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem is that the technology is so modern and attractive that, in truth, the industry cannot manufacture the quantities required in the immediate future. This, of course, presents a problem because we must ensure that the ballasts are available at the right time when we pass our regulation, otherwise there will be a certain shortage. If it is no longer possible to manufacture the magnetic ballasts and there are not enough electronic ballasts available, then the market may encounter difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am in favour of a legislative regulation, despite the fact that I have considered long and hard as to whether a European directive for ballasts does, in fact, make sense. I am in favour, however, because I believe that we should invest more research in this technology in the future. We should make an effort to ensure that future investments are channelled into electronic ballasts. This is already self-evident from the market itself, but I think that this directive could act as an incentive to invest more funds more quickly and achieve a solid return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I feel that the debate has not been followed very closely, and I wonder how many of the Members will be able to vote with any understanding of the subject, given that a person’s general knowledge – accumulated through studies, everyday life or even the political life of a Member of Parliament – is unlikely to stretch to a thorough understanding of ballasts for fluorescent lighting. I wonder, therefore, whether these subjects need to be discussed in the House, or whether it would be better, making full use of the regulatory provisions, to restrict these debates to the committees. The highly technical nature of some subjects prevents us understanding what we are voting on, although, of course, we could always stay with the customary crosses and dashes on the voting lists that are prepared by someone else. But this would debase our job! We wonder, moreover, if it is necessary for Parliament to address such complex and highly technical issues, or whether it would be better, as is the case with national regulations, to give responsibility for these subjects to other bodies, considering – and we heard this from the previous speakers – that they have minimal political implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to make a remark about so-called clean energy, which I do not think many Members took in. It is not true that electrical energy is clean energy: obviously, if I heat my house in the town with electric radiators rather than water radiators powered by a naphtha heater, there will be less pollution in the town, but if we consider, as the report says, that in any case 30% of the CO2 in the atmosphere comes from electricity production, perhaps it would be appropriate for the public to revise their knowledge and convictions and, above all, for clearer information to be provided regarding what actually is clean energy and what is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All of this is necessary to achieve a substantial improvement in efficiency in the end use of electricity, thereby complying with our Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal takes a cautious approach aimed at improving energy efficiency while not imposing an excessive burden on the manufacturers of ballasts. I would like to point out, as some speakers have highlighted, that the sector involved was consulted before this proposal was drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a proposal which works in different stages. The first stage, which will be effective as of one year following adoption of the directive, will involve the progressive elimination of low efficiency ballasts. A second stage of more demanding regulations will then progressively reduce the number of conventional ballasts, making obligatory the use of high performance, high efficiency ballasts.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out – in order to illustrate the change which this implies – that, currently, conventional ballasts make up approximately two thirds of total current sales, which means that this second stage will have very significant effects and will no doubt have repercussions for the industry. We therefore propose a transitional period of four years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments proposed, I am pleased to tell you that the Commission can accept all of those presented by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, with the exception of Amendments Nos 1, 17, 19 and 20, on the automatic introduction of a third stage of efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that it is necessary to take a dynamic approach and therefore the proposal lays down the possibility of a third stage. Nevertheless, we believe that it would be difficult to establish all the characteristics of this third stage at the moment. In our opinion, it is preferable to evaluate the technical and economic situation at the moment of the entry into force of the second stage and determine, by consulting the parties involved at that moment, whether to carry out the third stage, how it should be carried out, what the technical definitions should be, which requirements should be laid down and within what time scale it can be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission can also accept the second part of Amendment No 23, but not the first part. In the same way, the Commission can also accept part of Amendment No 1, with a different wording. Furthermore, we also agree with Amendment No 12 in order that the Member States may carry out effective application.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments aimed at clarifying the fact that all ballasts sold as independent components or incorporated into lamps are covered by the proposal, that is to say, Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 21 and 22, as I have said, are all acceptable to the Commission. Amendment No 2 is also acceptable, since the Commission agrees with the exclusion of the types of ballasts mentioned, as are Amendments Nos 15 and 16, which extend the transitional period to 18 months. Finally, the Commission accepts Amendment No 8 on the promotion of efficiency regulations at international forums.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have summarised the Commission’s position with regard to the report. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, once again, on his excellent work and I trust that the Council can adopt a common position which will allow this question to be speedily resolved.</p>
