<p class="contents">What steps must be taken to ensure that an investigation is carried out with sufficient guarantees that it will clarify who bears criminal responsibility and who is liable to pay compensation in relation to the murder of the European citizen José Couso, and of his fellow journalists who died while doing their duty of informing the public?</p>

<p class="contents">Whilst carrying out their work as journalists José Couso, a Spanish citizen (cameraman for the Spanish TV channel Tele 5), Taras Proyuk (Reuters press agency) and Tarek Ayoub (the TV channel Al Jazeera) were killed by the United States’ attack on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad on 8 April 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The US authorities have remained totally silent about this dramatic murder ever since and there have not been any investigations or judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the same authorities have decided to start an investigation, together with the Italian Government, into the unjustified attack by the same forces on 4 March 2005, which caused the death of Nicola Calipari, following the release of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Investigation into the murder of the journalist José Couso in Iraq</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 4 March 2005, the freeing of the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena led to the killing of the Italian citizen Nicola Calipar by the US army.</p>
<p class="contents">Under pressure from Italian public opinion, the Italian Government and the USA have decided to carry out a joint investigation to attempt to clarify this unhappy event. But the cases of the Spanish Tele 5 cameraman, José Couso, the Ukrainian Reuters cameraman Taras Prosyuk and the Al Jazira television cameraman Tarek Ayoub, who were all killed as a result of an attack carried out by US forces on the Hotel Palestine in Baghdad, have not been the subject of any investigation or court proceedings to date, as far as we know.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that José Couso was a European citizen, what steps could be taken on the part of the European Union with a view to carrying out a joint investigation with the US authorities, so as to throw light on what happened and, where appropriate, determine who was responsible?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 79 by Jean-Marie Cavada (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0241_EN.html">H-0241/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Investigation into the death of the journalist José Couso</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 8 April 2003 two cameramen, Spaniard José Couso working for the television station Telecinco and Ukrainian Taras Protsyuk working for Reuters news agency, were killed in Baghdad when the American army fired on the Palestine Hotel, where several hundred non-embedded journalists were staying. On the same day, 8 April 2003, Jordanian journalist Tarek Ayoub from the Al-Jazeera channel was also killed during an American air raid. According to Reporters Without Borders, the report provided by the American authorities on the circumstances surrounding these tragedies is inadequate. It does not identify those responsible, and conceals the lack of communication between the soldiers who fired on the Palestine Hotel and their superiors with regard to the fact that journalists were present inside the building.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps might be taken by the European Union with a view to an independent inquiry being held into the circumstances surrounding the death of José Couso, in order that the culprits are identified and tried and the victim's family receives compensation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission wants to stress on this occasion that it attaches the greatest importance to the freedom of information and the work carried out by journalists, often under very difficult conditions in conflict situations. We believe that in all armed conflicts like the one in Iraq, respect for international laws and the principle of accountability should be fully applied for all operating forces. Regarding the death of the journalist Jose Couso, as well as the more recent injury to an Italian journalist and the death of an Italian security agent, we regret such incidents and express our solidarity with the families of those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously believe that all such cases should be thoroughly investigated by the relevant authorities. It is essential that the circumstances and the responsibilities be fully clarified and any necessary follow-up measures be taken swiftly and transparently. However, the steps required to ensure a proper investigation by the relevant authorities into the death of an EU national in a third country are the responsibility of the Member States involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And that is part of the question, because there are two problems here: one of them is the defence of freedom of information and the other, the defence of the rights of the European citizens and their families in third countries.

The former Spanish Government had undertaken no initiatives or formal protests. Under current legislation in Spain, members of the public may bring cases to the attention of investigating magistrates independently of law enforcement and other state agencies. In that respect, therefore, Judge Guillermo Ruiz Polanco of the <span class="italic">Audiencia Nacional</span> has commenced preliminary investigations. He thus accepted the lawsuit filed on 27 May by Mr Couso’s mother and siblings against three members of the Third Infantry Division. I cannot say what the outcome will be, but that has been filed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Italian Government, it has expressed its formal protests to Washington, firmly asking for an investigation into the causes of the fatal accident. Parallel investigations are being carried out by the US military and Italian judges, so again I would like to reiterate that it is the responsibility of the Member States themselves to care for their own nationals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that many British citizens who have chosen to retire to other EU Member States cannot currently vote in national referenda on the proposed European Constitution? Under current domestic legislation, if they left the UK more than 15 years ago they no longer have the right to vote there, yet they are not automatically granted the right to vote in their new country of residence either. Whilst it is up to individual Member States to grant such a right, should there not be some coordination between Member States so that the voices of such people can be heard? Surely it has to be fundamentally wrong that any European citizen is denied a vote on such an important issue? Does the Commission know how many European citizens are affected in such a way, and can it propose ways for Member States to work together to resolve the problem? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The definition of the conditions of the right to vote in national elections and referenda belongs to the competence of the Member States. It is therefore up to each Member State to lay down the appropriate rules on the right to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received complaints from Union citizens – not only the honourable Member – who, as a result of exercising their right to free residence in a Member State other than their home Member State, have no right to participate in national or regional elections or referenda, either in their Member State of residence or in their home Member State. This issue has also been mentioned in the recently adopted Fourth Report from the Commission on the citizenship of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, on the basis of the Fourth Report, awaits reactions from the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States and will consider this important and sensitive issue further. However, as participation in elections or referenda at national level is entirely governed by national legislation, in the absence of Community competence, changes in the legal or constitutional orders of the Member States would be necessary to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to national elections before 1 May 2004, this question concerned around 5 million Union citizens of voting age who resided in another Member State.

It therefore proposes the production of sugar beyond the quota at a price closer to that on the world market, for the processing of specific products like bioethanol.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know sugar beet for the production of biofuel can already be cultivated outside the quota limits. The forthcoming legislative proposal will have to ensure that sufficient sugar is available at competitive prices for these industries, including for its increasing use in biofuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the biofuels directive, Member States are required to promote and to set targets for the use of biofuels. Bioethanol from sugar and grain is a good way to meet this objective. The Commission is taking steps to ensure that all Member States fulfil their obligations under the directive. The Commission will review the implementation of the directive in 2006 and will, if necessary, propose measures to reinforce it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that some firms in the bioethanol industry have expressed reluctance to invest in processing facilities in the EU because they are concerned about the possibility of tariff reductions, leading to large-scale imports from low-cost sugar cane ethanol producers outside the EU. The Commission believes that a ‘win-win’ solution should be found that leads to a rapid increase in EU bioethanol production and consumption, combined in a proportionate manner with increased imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The fuel quality directive places a limit on the ethanol content of petrol. The Commission is reviewing certain aspects of the directive and will take into account the need to encourage the use of alternative fuels, including biofuels, as well as the need to introduce modifications for other parameters in the fuel specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to support targeted research action aimed at developing cost-competitive alternative fuel technology, including ethanol production from sweet sorghum, cereals, agricultural residues and other ligno-cellulosic feedstock.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission currently contributes to the creation of a European biofuels industry by supporting and facilitating initiatives to create a biofuel technology platform. Stakeholders on this platform will include, amongst others, the agricultural and forestry sectors, bioethanol producers and the sugar industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the Commission’s final decision on the restructuring of British Energy and its decision to open proceedings on the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority make it clear that under the polluter pays principle, operators of nuclear stations bear the primary responsibility for the payment of the management of their waste and other nuclear liabilities, including planned decommissioning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one has to keep in mind that, as with all principles of Community law, the polluter pays principle must be reconciled with other Community principles and objectives, which may, in certain circumstances, conflict with it. In the British Energy case, for instance, the polluter pays principle had to be reconciled with the need to preserve nuclear safety, which is also, as you know, a major Community objective enshrined in the Euratom Treaty. In such cases the Commission seeks to strike the best possible balance between diverging principles for the benefit of the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In carrying out its assessment, it is entitled to take account only of competition-related or economic criteria when determining whether the transaction in question significantly impedes competition in the common market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, notwithstanding the Commission’s sole jurisdiction to examine mergers with a Community dimension, Article 21(4) of the regulation provides that Member States may take appropriate measures to protect legitimate interests other than those taken into consideration by the regulation, provided that they are compatible with the general principles and other provisions of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The legitimate interests specifically recognised by the merger regulation include media plurality. ‘The Member State’s right to plead the plurality of the media recognises the legitimate concern to maintain diversified sources of information for the sake of plurality of opinion and multiplicity of use’. This would appear to include the objective information referred to in the question by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the foregoing that the Member States should as a matter of priority take appropriate measures under their national law to safeguard the plurality of the media if that legitimate interest were to be threatened by a merger with a Community dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission points out that in practice the aim of the merger regulation, namely to preserve and develop competitive market structures, can go hand in hand, at least to some extent, with safeguarding media plurality. When the Commission considers whether a merger with a Community dimension hampers competition on a media market, it necessarily examines the degree of concentration and hence indirectly the degree of pluralism on that market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: State aid</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government recently withdrew its attempt to get State aid worth EUR 170 million sanctioned for a new microchip plant in Ireland. The Commission has said that the project did not involve sufficient innovation or jobs to justify giving assistance.

<p class="contents">Firstly, there was a real risk of distortion of the conditions of competition since Intel has very significant market power in microchip production, and the aid would allow the company to reinforce its dominance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the basis of the information submitted, the investment project appeared to be for the large-scale manufacturing of microchips. There was no indication that research and development activity would be transferred to Europe, nor of the creation of new jobs at the Leixlip site.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Leixlip is located in a prosperous region that may not be eligible for regional aid after 2006. Any regional investment aid therefore needs to refer to a project scheduled to start before the end of 2006, which was not the case with Modules II and III of the investment project.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons the Commission envisaged to launch an in-depth inquiry according to state aid rules, in order to analyse the balance of the positive and negative aspects of the aid.

<p class="contents">We should not underestimate the importance of the facilities in Leixlip for the local economy. This is aid for a mobile manufacturing project, which will maintain a large number of jobs in the region for seven years, but will not create any new employment. To be quite frank, Ireland is an example that proves how important the European Union and our policy to stimulate the economy is.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in this case no new jobs would be created. There is no indication that the project would lead to a transfer of any significant part of the company’s research and development base to Europe from the US, for example, or would develop other synergies or spillover effects, which would in turn contribute to innovation in Europe, going beyond the specific manufacturing operations concerned. This is a pure manufacturing project for the large-scale production of microchips that will help Intel to maintain its position as a leader in the relevant market. It was exactly the combination of those points and arguments that led us to think what we were thinking until the Irish Government withdrew the notification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the first four sales periods, consumers who do not have a German bank account can pay for tickets by using MasterCard products or by making an international bank transfer. The issue of MasterCard exclusivity and bank transfer fees for making international bank transfers raised by the honourable Member are also part of the complaint that the Commission is currently examining with the required urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">First all the relevant facts need to be established and examined under the relevant EU competition provisions before the Commission can take a position. If, at the end of the examination, the Commission were to conclude that there was an infringement, the Commission could take appropriate action, for instance ordering the arrangements to be stopped, and fine the company or companies that have breached EU competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euro, it establishes that cross-border transfers in euro up to the amount of EUR 12 500 until 31 December 2005 shall be at the same price as national transfers in euro. For countries outside the eurozone, this price can be very high: a transfer in euro in the UK currently costs more than EUR 20.

<p class="contents">You may recall that we had similar problems with the sales of tickets by the French football authorities during the World Cup held in France. A number of MEP colleagues, including me, took them to the European Court of Justice; the eventual result of which was that the Commission intervened and they were fined EUR 500 on the basis that they had contravened European Union regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder if you can assure us that, allowing for the fact that the German football authorities were aware of what had happened to their French counterparts, any fine in this case will be several orders of magnitude higher? You may even reach the stage of asking them to redo the whole thing.</p>

If so, has this information been forwarded to the Commission and when? Does the Commission know the amount of toxic and hazardous waste produced annually in Greece and how it is disposed of: is it stored temporarily, incinerated, dumped in landfill sites or exported for final disposal in other countries (and which countries)? Has Greece complied with the above-mentioned ECJ judgment against it and, if not, does the Commission intend to initiate proceedings against Greece once again before the ECJ, pursuant to Article 228(2) of the EC Treaty, and specify a fine? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall reply to these issues one at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the criteria on the basis of which waste is accepted at each class of landfill site is concerned, the procedures and measures for accepting waste at sanitary landfill sites, as they are euphemistically called in Greece, are basically set out in joint ministerial decree 29407/3508 of 2002 transposing the landfill of waste directive into Greek legislation. All Greek decrees on hazardous waste management are notified to the Commission as soon as they are issued. Council decision 2003/33 establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste at landfills entered into force in June 2004. The Member States are required to apply the criteria set out in the second part of the annex to the said decision by 16 July 2005. Greece has still not notified any additional measures of compliance with this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns information on the hazardous waste produced annually in Greece. Within the framework of the submission of reports on the application of the hazardous waste directive, the Greek authorities pass on information on the quantities of waste produced annually and the methods used to dispose of or recover it. According to the information available for the period from 1998 to 2003, an average of 363 400 tonnes of hazardous waste was produced annually. Most of this, approximately two thirds of the hazardous waste produced, is stored temporarily before it is definitively disposed of or recovered. More detailed information is available to the honourable Member, if he is interested.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards non-compliance with the judgment of 13 June 2002, Article 8, paragraph 3 of Directive 91/689 makes provision for a specific obligation to submit reports. To be precise, the Member States are required to send the Commission information on every unit or undertaking or establishment engaged in the disposal and recovery of hazardous waste. In its judgment of 13 June 2002, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Hellenic Republic had failed to fulfil its obligations under the above provisions. As the Commission was sent unsatisfactory information on the measures which Greece had taken to comply with the Court judgment, the Commission set in motion the procedure in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty of the European Communities. In response to the official letter of notification from the Commission, the Greek authorities sent the information available, as required under Article 8. This information is being examined in order to establish the extent to which Greece has complied with the aforementioned Court judgment. If the information passed on is found to be unsatisfactory, the Commission shall be forced to issue a reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 228, paragraph 2 of the Treaty of the European Communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the quantity is concerned, I spoke to you of even more.

We have none after 2003. Of this quantity, approximately 60%, although this percentage had risen to about 80% in 2003, is still in storage on temporary sites. Of course, under the Community directive, if the waste is kept in temporary storage for longer than a year, then the site must be classed as a landfill and must comply with the relevant preconditions, which is not happening in the case of the Greek authorities, which is why, as I said, the relevant procedures have been set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It indicated that at that stage significant progress had been made by Member States in this area. In recent years that progress has been maintained. All Member States have by now established water monitoring networks. All have either designated nitrate-vulnerable zones and established action programmes for those zones, or made use of the possibility given by the directive to establish an action programme for the whole territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is among a group of Member States that took this option. Nitrate-vulnerable zones, including whole territories, accounted for about 38% of the total European Union of 15 in 2000. Since then the percentage has increased because of the designation of new vulnerable zones in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece, Spain and Italy and because of the territorial approach chosen by Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are also upgrading and further developing their action programmes as they realise that, in order to improve water quality, strong and fully applicable action programmes are necessary. Similar progress has been taking place in the new Member States. They have fulfilled the commitment set out in the Accession Treaty and by the date of accession had designated nitrate-vulnerable zones, established action programmes and adopted codes of good agricultural practice. The Commission is currently examining the quality of these designations and action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that progress, it may take years before we see a considerable improvement in water quality. There is a time lag between action and results. However, the trend seems positive as encouraging signs are already emerging in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully committed to ensuring that the Nitrates Directive is correctly implemented in Member States by using all the tools at its disposal. That clearly includes the launch of infringement proceedings against Member States that do not correctly implement the different steps required by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">An infringement procedure is currently open against Ireland. Following the ruling of the European Court of Justice of 11 March 2003, the Irish authorities officially submitted to the Commission the action programme established according to Article 5 of the directive. The Commission considers the Irish action programme not fully compliant with the directive on several issues, which were indicated in detail in the letter of formal notice sent to Ireland at the end of 2004. A reply is still awaited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

About 20% of Europe’s groundwater has an excessive nitrate concentration and the same problem affects at least 30-40% of rivers and lakes.

Ireland sent an answer on 22 December and we replied, also on 22 December, giving the Irish authorities three months to respond.

The Commission believes it is important that Kosovo participate fully in this process on the basis of its own merits. It would indeed be detrimental for the security of Europe if Kosovo becomes a black hole in a region which is otherwise progressing towards European Union pre-accession and later accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the provisional institutions of self-government in making progress in the implementation of the priority standards related to the rule of law and multiethnicity before the review date of mid-2005. The Commission has included the standards as the main priorities in the European Partnership for Kosovo. We provide over EUR 125 million in CARDS assistance programmes. We continue to support Kosovo through the SAP Tracking mechanism by giving policy advice and assistance to counterbalance the perception that once the status talks start, standards will no longer be necessary. They will be even more important once the status talks start.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to promoting the EU perspective of Kosovo, since, regardless of its future status, Kosovo is and will remain in Europe. In this context, we have set up a liaison office in Pristina that works together with the representative of the High Representative, as well as the European Agency for Reconstruction and the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is preparing a communication to the Council on enhancing the European perspective of Kosovo. This communication will be a contribution to the joint work of the Commission and the High Representative and the presidency, as invited by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in February to focus on the future contribution of the EU to the efforts of the international community in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will work closely with Mr Javier Solana and the Luxembourg EU presidency on the scope of the EU’s future role in Kosovo after UNMIK. Personally, I do not foresee that the EU will govern Kosovo as the successor to UNMIK, as this would contradict our policy of building capacity and sustainability in partner countries with whom we hope one day to negotiate. The scope of EU involvement in the future needs to be examined very carefully in view of its important political and financial implications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two specific points I should like to address, the first being that the task of achieving standards obviously becomes more difficult when unemployment stands at 70%. It may well be necessary to determine a status – at least on a medium-term basis – before standards can be met, and some indication of this status, if nothing else, must be given before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the people of Kosovo are of course very much in favour of a European administration, as they want an administration that applies European criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is detrimental that the province has developed unemployment that, on the basis of some statistics, is about 50%, but on the basis of other statistics is even higher. Therefore, it is indispensable that we continue to support Kosovo with our financial assistance. It is also vital that the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo be given support under UNMIK Pillar 4, which the EU supports, in order to make headway as regards economic reform, including privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the settlement is needed sooner rather than later as the demographic pressure in Kosovo makes its economic recovery a very difficult task in the absence of a clear legally defined and internationally recognised framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the future role of the Union, the idea that the European Union would replace the United Nations in a leading executive role would be problematic. We support the idea of a streamlined UN mission handing over as much responsibility as possible to empower the local authorities that should, as much as possible, be our direct interlocutors in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The continued reform of the judicial system stands out as the overarching priority for Bulgaria in its preparations for accession. Clear steps for the reform of the judiciary have been agreed in the accession negotiations. The commitments undertaken must be fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Important challenges lie ahead, notably as regards the adoption of the new penal procedure code, making the entire pre-trial investigation phase simpler and corresponding to EU best practices. This requires a clear consensus of all parties involved, including the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the overall working conditions, the need for enhancing specialisation of judges and prosecutors, the appointment procedures, access to legal aid in practice, and other commitments from the accession negotiations will need to be addressed. Apart from political will, sufficient budgetary resources are also needed to meet these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Bulgarian authorities should now make every effort to ensure the completion of the reform, especially with regard to the pre-trial phase. This is indispensable to ensure that Bulgaria has the legal means and resources to fully apply the rule of law and requirements of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems as though the preparation for this reform is taking more time than was initially expected. The Bulgarian authorities have nevertheless reiterated their commitment to a new draft penal procedures code to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on 15 May. I am reasonably confident that this commitment will be respected, as this is indispensable for Bulgaria to meet its commitments from the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will keep a close watch on this area through intensified monitoring, to get sufficient assurances that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that the country will be effectively ready for membership in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now that Turkey has been given the go-ahead for future negotiations on EU accession, the latest figure for women's rate of employment in the country is a cause for concern. Only 10% of Turkish women are in gainful employment. Social democrats have long regarded the question of women's right to work as extremely important for increasing equality between women and men. Women in gainful employment have a sound basis for an independent life and do not become financially dependent on the family to support them. This issue has also been highlighted in the Lisbon strategy where the objective is to increase women's employment in the EU to 60% by 2010. In the light of the Copenhagen criterion requiring all applicant countries to be able to meet the Union's political, economic and monetary objectives, will the Commission say whether the question of women's employment will be raised as a priority matter in future accession negotiations with Turkey? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation of women in Turkey is important, and I should like to address another issue in connection with the membership negotiations. A large demonstration by women was, of course, held in Turkey in the run-up to International Women's Day on 8 March. It was brutally suppressed by the police. The police concerned were suspended immediately, and Turkey’s ambassador in Brussels has been to the European Parliament to talk about the matter and explain what Turkey is doing. Because such police brutality is incompatible with the demands we are making of a country that is to conduct membership negotiations with the EU, I wonder if Commissioner Rehn knows if Turkey has taken further judicial measures following the incident concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once we saw what had happened and had obtained information, we issued a clear statement on behalf of the European Union, together with the Luxembourg presidency and the forthcoming UK presidency, in which we condemned all violence in demonstrations. We also condemned the disproportionate use of force, which was clearly being used in the treatment of the mainly female and young demonstrators in Istanbul.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 62 by Panagiotis Beglitis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0213_EN.html">H-0213/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Construction and operation of three nuclear power stations in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">A recent article in the Turkish newspaper 'Radikal' reported on Turkey's energy programme and the Turkish Government's intention to proceed with the construction and operation by 2012 of three nuclear power stations, the first of which is to be built in the region of Konia. If these reports are confirmed, this will give rise to a new situation in the wider Mediterranean region and be a source of legitimate concern to neighbouring countries and peoples, especially Greece and its island regions, which are close to the areas selected as sites for the power stations. Bearing in mind Turkey's vulnerability to earthquakes, the building of power stations represents a nightmare scenario both for the environment and for the lives of millions of people in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission become aware of this information through its regular contacts with the Turkish authorities? If so, what steps has it taken, or will it take, to prevent this programme from going ahead? More generally, how will it approach the question of nuclear power in Turkey during the pre-accession negotiations beginning in October 2005? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that the option to use nuclear energy has been under consideration in Turkey for <span class="italic">many</span> years, since 1965. We have informed Parliament on this issue on several occasions. At this point, Turkey does not operate any nuclear power plant, nor has a licence been issued for the construction of any such plant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recalls that under the Treaties, each Member State is free to use the energy sources of its choice. Currently, roughly half of all Member States use nuclear energy. Consequently, the decision to use or not to use nuclear power has never been the subject of any accession negotiations. However, as you may recall, in the previous enlargement round, the EU insisted on the need for a high level of nuclear safety in candidate countries operating nuclear plants, and substantial parts of the pre-accession strategy have been devoted to this aim. In certain cases, the EU has even demanded the early closure of old nuclear plants or nuclear reactors which had been identified by the international community as non-upgradeable at reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey is going to generate nuclear energy, it will obviously have to ensure a high level of nuclear safety as well. As a candidate country, Turkey will also be expected to comply with the Euratom acquis on nuclear safeguards and radiation protection, as well as the Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments. This includes transboundary consultation with Member States. Under the International Convention of Nuclear Safety, of which the European Atomic Energy Community is a contracting party, Turkey already has an obligation to consult neighbouring countries on proposed nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">Several potential sites have been named in the past in Turkey, while only one site has received a licence. Studies for up to three other possible sites have recently been included in the investment plans of the Ministry of Energy. The Commission has followed with interest the situation as it has evolved, and in particular the evaluation of relevant seismic conditions. It is clear that any nuclear power plant would have to be designed and built in a manner allowing it to withstand any potential seismic event and thus guarantee the necessary level of safety under all conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like the Commissioner to monitor this issue closely during negotiations. I do not dispute the right of a country to build nuclear power stations. The point is, first, the high level of security needed and, secondly, the fact that all of us – including the European Commission – need to guarantee that nuclear energy will be used solely for peaceful purposes and not for military purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But in any case nuclear security will be a core issue, especially if there is a reason to focus on that issue. Turkey is not yet at the construction stage.
