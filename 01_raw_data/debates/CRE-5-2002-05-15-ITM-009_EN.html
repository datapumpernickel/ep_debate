<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Bart Staes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0265_EN.html">H-0265/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: More beneficial use of unspent budget appropriations</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ annual report on the 2000 financial year revealed that more than EUR 11 billion in European budget appropriations had remained unspent. Commissioner Schreyer confirmed at a recent meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament that the budget surplus for 2001 was approximately EUR 10 billion. Under the existing financial rules, these unspent funds are returned to the Member States. Yet the European Union is in need of large sums of money, inter alia to help cope with the impact of enlargement. The Council and Parliament together comprise the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">What view does the Council take of the idea of amending the financial rules so that in future unspent funds would no longer be returned to the Member States but be paid into a fund which could be used to finance measures, for example, connected with enlargement or to fight poverty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not therefore want to be accused of that type of thing again.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the question from Mr Staes, I would like to say that the Council is aware that the implementation balance of the last two budgetary years reached a very considerable volume. I would point out to the honourable Member that, in the Council recommendation on the discharge of the 2000 budget, the Commission is asked, with the cooperation of the Member States, to be more accurate in its budgetary forecasts, both in relation to sources of funding and in terms of expenditure, with a view to preventing excessive surpluses in the future. If necessary, and as suggested by the Court of Auditors in its annual report, the Commission should make modifications, in order to take account of the different developments, by applying the existing budgetary instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that, within the framework of the legislation in force, we should insist on the need to improve budgetary estimates so that this situation does not arise to this extent again in the future. On the other hand, with regard to the suggestions of the honourable Member, the Council would like to point out that it cannot go ahead with such a revision without a previous proposal from the Commission. In its latest proposal to reshape the Financial Regulation which is currently being debated in the Council, it has simply insisted on the principle in accordance with which the balance for each financial year will be allocated in the budget of the following year, as income or as expenditure, whether there is a surplus or a deficit (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article 32 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977, which is now being reviewed) and this must be done by means of an amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, and in accordance with what I have just said, the Council is still seeking a way to maintain the payment appropriations allocated in the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr de Miguel, I completely share your view that a better description must be produced and that the budget must be planned more effectively. All of this must be done. However, if there happens to be a budget surplus, if there has been underspending, if you establish that this amount was 10 billion last year, and 11 billion the year before that, and maybe a few billion this year, then would it not be a good idea to put this money in a fund of some kind? This fund should also be used, really used, for emergencies which we know are heading our way. Enlargement is going to be far more expensive than currently envisaged. Let us put the money in a fund so that it cannot return to the Member States, for in the final analysis, we agreed in the ping-pong game between the Council and Parliament, the two budgetary authorities, that a certain amount will be spent in a certain year, and that we actually spend this money on Europe and not let it make its way back to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a shame that the budget is not spent and the money has to be returned at the end of the year. Naturally, it does not fall to me to decide this; there would have to be a provision in the Financial Regulation which, as you know, would have to be approved unanimously by the Member States. It would therefore be highly desirable for a provision of this type to be introduced and approved in the new Financial Regulation, which is about to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Chechnya, I regret that there has been a misunderstanding. I reacted like that simply because I believe we have been insisting on the issue of Chechnya with true dedication, in accordance with the views of the European Parliament.

<p class="contents">On 1 March 2002, the Basque Parliament adopted a 'non-legislative proposal' drawing attention to the various positions adopted within the European institutions on internal political conflicts in the EU, such as the European Parliament's Reding report of November 1996 and Watson report of November 2001.

The Basque Country is not between France and Spain. It is not Andorra. The Autonomous Community of the Basque Country is in the Spanish state, and, naturally, the French Basque Country, as the name itself suggests, is in the French state, and is part of the French state. Let us, however, move on to the supplementary question. Does the President not think that if Basque President Ibarretxe, who is of course the main representative of the Spanish state in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, according to the Organic Law of the Statute of Autonomy, were to devote all his efforts and those of his government to going after and arresting terrorists, and isolating their accomplices, and had he come here, to Parliament and the Institutions, to ask us for help in putting a stop to ETA, the terrorists would already have lost hope?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the President not believe that the problem in Basque politics is not only lack of freedom due to terrorism, but also the existence of a democratic government that undermines the democratic institutions it democratically employs, and creates conflict, and I repeat, creates conflict between the Kingdom of Spain and the French Republic?</p>

<p class="contents">The conclusions also indicated the four elements on which the said policy should be based: partnership with countries of origin; a common European asylum system; management of migration flows; and fair treatment of third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2000, in line with the Tampere conclusions, the Commission adopted two communications, one on a common immigration policy and the other on a common asylum policy. These communications laid down guidelines which the Commission believes should be used as a basis for defining a common strategy in the medium and long term and creating a common framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the European Council Meeting in Laeken of 14 and 15 December 2001 highlighted the need, consistent with the establishment and application of a common policy on asylum and immigration, cited in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, to push through the proposals debated in the Council and consider the adoption of other actions and measures as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the bodies of the Council are currently examining various legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the area of legal immigration, the debates concern very important and sensitive matters, such as regrouping families of third-country nationals and the situation of third-country nationals who have been resident in a Member State for years and the requirements to be met by third-country nationals in order to be allowed to enter the Member States and be able to exercise an economic activity in these States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of asylum, even though debates on the subject are under way with regard to certain proposals for directives, the Council, on 25 and 26 April, was able to establish general guidelines on the highly important directive laying down the minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States, pending the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to reinforcing border controls and combating illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, it should be reported that the Council of 27 and 28 February 2002 approved an action plan establishing the actions and measures that the European Union must adopt and setting deadlines for their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference must also be made to the activity of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, charged by the Council on 25 and 26 January 1999 with drawing up action plans for the countries of origin and transit of asylum seekers and migrants, on the basis of an integrated approach. The said action plans establish, amongst others, actions to encourage and promote development in the countries concerned, and practical measures to reduce clandestine migration flows. The Council has adopted action plans for Afghanistan, Albania – a region bordering the EU – Morocco, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Iraq. In this respect, it should also be noted that a budget heading, B7-667, has been established. This is intended to finance projects within the framework of cooperation with third countries in the area of immigration. The difficulties experienced in the areas of immigration and asylum, to a great extent, relate to the significant differences between legislation in the Member States, which has changed substantially in recent years. What is more, the need to anticipate and combat illegal immigration has sometimes led to the adoption of more restrictive national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite the difficulties and problems raised in the debates on instruments laid down and proposed to implement the provisions of the Treaty, in particular on the basis of the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, the commitment and efforts made at Council level to speed up their examination and adoption, and thus create a basis for a body of binding legislation for the Community as a whole in this respect, should be highlighted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now see a number of countries which are, as I say, a comfortably long way away from the influx of refugees considerably tightening up on their refugee and asylum policy. Britain is doing so, and so is Denmark. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a joint resolution needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency.

With regard to the country I know best, however, my own country, I can tell you that Spain is well able to control its southern borders and that, currently, its problem is not border control, but the fact that there are no readmission agreements between the European Union and most Sub-Saharan African countries. Therefore, as the Deputy Prime Minister said during the debate yesterday, the problem is not so much controlling immigration as saving the lives of immigrants who come over in dangerous vessels. Our real problem, moreover, is not arresting them, which is very easy; our problem is saving their lives, and once we have saved their lives, the next problem is that there is no way of sending them home, as there are no readmission agreements, nor do their countries want them. In this respect, the European Union could put great pressure on those countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement. That way, we could impose this obligation on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, however, like to tell you for information purposes, Mrs Frahm, that the greatest flow of illegal immigrants received by Spain does not actually come from the south. The majority of illegal immigrants coming to Spain arrive easily, unchallenged, across the border between France and Spain and come from the Eastern European countries. These illegal immigrants cross the borders of Germany, Austria, Italy and all the other countries that have a border with the Eastern European countries perfectly easily. They cross the whole of Europe with ease and settle in Spain, and we have no means of controlling them. That is what really concerns us, because in Spain as in Italy, which has common borders with the rest of the European Union, we are receiving more illegal immigrants across our borders with our fellow Member States than through crossings from the south by sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I suppose you are aware that the Spanish newspapers recently reported on immigrants working in a strawberry production company in Huelva who were, and I quote, "living like animals", with the company owing them more than three months' wages. If these immigrants, who are hoping for something called "work", are living in these conditions, one can only guess at the miserable conditions being experienced by the five thousand Moroccans I referred to in my question, who are roaming around that region without work. These people, after being used to working on the strawberry harvest for years, were this year replaced by temporary workers from eastern European states, who ironically benefit from labour contracts recognised by the Spanish Government but denied to our Moroccan neighbours. This behaviour, apart from being inequitable and inhuman, will lead to a deterioration in relations with Moroccan immigrants, will worsen the position of the communities affected, will damage mutual respect and even lead to racist behaviour, while encouraging political extremism, which we condemn.

<p class="contents">It is proposed amongst other things to raise the age limit for family unification to 24 in the case of marriage.

Citizens over the age of 24, too, face restrictions if they marry someone who is not a citizen of a Nordic country.</p>

<p class="contents">As Mrs Díez knows very well, Spain, before holding the Presidency and then as holder of the Presidency, sought to achieve the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean bank and this aim consequently appeared in the conclusions of the Laeken European Council. This was no chance happening, since we were preparing the ground for the next ministerial meeting and for the Spanish Presidency itself and this desire was asserted once again at the Barcelona European Council, but in a much more low-key way. It is not that there was any less ambition, because the ambition remains the same and we are ensuring that it remains the same. It is simply that the process will be more difficult and certainly lengthier than was envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality of the situation is that these matters must be approved with the agreement of the competent Council, which is the Economic and Finance Council and various countries felt, for reasons of their own, that opening a bank at this time would be too risky. They opted first to create a facility, then to establish a subsidiary and then, with time, to see if the bank could be set up with contributions, not only from Europe, but also from our Mediterranean partner countries themselves, which are clearly very keen to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, I can only share Mrs Díez’s disappointment. I hope that we can continue to maintain our ambition and our objective. This will be a more difficult, perhaps more tortuous and perhaps a longer process, but our aim is still to create a Mediterranean Development Bank which will benefit the countries of the Mediterranean basin and, most importantly, which will finance all of the enormous development needs that are so obvious to us at the present time. These needs, furthermore, have the tragic effect of forcing the citizens of these countries to leave for Europe and this causes all the misfortunes that immigration entails and with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that this is an instrument that can contribute to the development of these countries and, consequently, by adopting this new method, we hope to achieve our stated objective of creating this bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that your arguments are well-founded, because we all know that even monies that are donated, such as the MEDA programme, very frequently go unused due to a lack of absorption capacity, or to an inability to produce projects.</p>
<p class="contents">A bank, however, is also an instrument, of course, with which to help countries to better understand how to make use of financial resources. Furthermore, a bank has the merit that, because it provides loans and the loans cost money, when people pay for a service, they always have an interest in its operating better. This is the merit of a development bank that, at the same time, is an advisory institution and which, when it charges a price for the money, ensures that those receiving the money gain more from the investment they make.</p>
<p class="contents">The<span class="italic"> </span>argument you put forward is that your country was the only one to have argued for this in Ecofin. For this reason, the Bank was not approached directly, and for this reason we opted for this phased process and we hope that, with this phased process, the conditions will gradually improve and a new mindset will come into play in the Mediterranean countries to make better use of the monies that, both in the form of donations and of loans, we make available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 13 by Alejandro Cercas (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0296_EN.html">H-0296/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The Lisbon strategy and full employment</span></p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the recent European Council summit in Barcelona state that full employment in the European Union is the core of the Lisbon Strategy and the essential goal of economic and social policies, which requires the creation of more and better jobs. They add that is therefore necessary to continue paying special attention to the reforms of employment and labour market policies. The Council Presidency also stresses in its programme that creating and improving jobs must figure among the priorities of every Presidency. Nevertheless, official estimates in the EU put unemployment at 7.8%, with Spain being the Member State with the highest rate of unemployment (12.9%, according to figures published by EUROSTAT in February 2002) and the least stable job situation, even though it has been experiencing a period of economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these figures, what initiatives will the Council Presidency take to ensure that national employment plans actually cut unemployment rates and promote quality jobs in all the Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is why it is crucial that we eliminate obstacles to integration into the labour market and promote active employment policies, maintaining the preventive approach and individualised attention on the unemployed to prevent them falling into long-term unemployment and to help them to improve their ability to integrate into the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council similarly wishes to emphasise that, in order to achieve the objectives set out in Lisbon, the European employment strategy must focus in particular on the challenges that the European Union faces in the long term, especially those affecting the ageing of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The European employment strategy must contribute to the creation of a dynamic and efficient labour market, in which motivated and well-trained employees are able to undertake high quality and highly productive tasks. Consequently, the strategy must make proper use of policies that improve both the supply and the demand of work<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the implementation of the employment strategy, the guidelines for Member States’ employment policies, in 2002, which were formally adopted by the Council at the beginning of this year, broadly reflect the new political messages sent by the recent European Council, which examined the issue of full employment in Europe. It is now up to the Member States to implement the employment policy, in accordance with the employment guidelines and in line with the principle of subsidiarity and with the Member States’ own competences in the field of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is the Member States that are responsible and Parliament has just said, in November, and has been saying for five years, that national employment<span class="italic"> </span>plans have major shortcomings in terms of programming, evaluating and following up; that there are no concrete objectives, that there are no indicators, that financial resources are not properly discussed. You said, and rightly so, that individualised programmes must be created. My reason for saying all of this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is to persuade you that in the 45 remaining days of this Presidency, the Spanish Presidency must really come up with a powerful initiative, because the problem is that the number of unemployed people in Europe is on the increase and we are not creating the jobs that we said we would in Lisbon and we cannot continue always saying the same thing, adopting a purely administrative approach, when faced with a problem of this scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as you know, there is no better way of obliging Member States to put forward truly substantial employment plans, than by applying the kind of pressure and political insistence that this debate represents. We have to make States aware that the commitments made at the Councils are truly binding and also that the issue of employment is the main objective of the Lisbon strategy. All the other elements of the Lisbon strategy are geared towards employment creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I will pass on this concern to the Spanish Minister for Labour and Social Affairs to see whether, in a forthcoming sitting of the Social Affairs Council – which has still to meet before the Presidency draws to a close – we can deal with this issue once again. However, the presentation of national employment plans takes place at the start of the year. We made an effort at the start of this year, when everything was presented to the Barcelona Council, where there were new instructions, but I believe that it cannot be said too often, even when it is not time to submit the plans – but when we have to start drawing them up – that the European Council laid down some very clear guidelines with regard to the national employment plans, and it would be good if the States were already to make tangible forecasts and more detailed employment plans for the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The stages leading to the implementation of this Police College, or CEPOL, can be summarised as follows, in chronological order:</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, the network was set up. The members of the College committed themselves to organising ten training operations on the priority issues set out in the Council Decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, in the absence of a definitive decision on the location of the Agency’s headquarters, Denmark temporarily hosted the secretariat of CEPOL, having previously obtained a budget of EUR 2.2 million for 2002 to be used to finance 17 training operations. CEPOL’s activities will increase throughout 2002. 21 training operations are planned, all having a clear relationship with the priorities set out by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cooperation between border control services in the Member States, the Council would refer to paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Tampere European Council Conclusions, in which Council calls for closer cooperation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States' border control services, such as exchange programmes and technology transfer, especially on maritime borders, and for the rapid inclusion of the applicant States in this cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Later, on 6 and 7 December 2001, the Council approved a document entitled ‘European management of border control’. This concept establishes, amongst other things, that those responsible for border control services should meet at least once every six months, within the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum, and allow the candidate countries to participate in their work, at least once a year.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 April 2002 the first meeting of the aforementioned committee took place in Brussels with the participation of representatives from border control services. This cooperation represents an initial stage in the implementation of other possible forms of cooperation, specifically in the light of the deliberations taking place on the forthcoming Commission Communication on border management, as well as the result of the feasibility study carried out by the Italian authorities with regard to the creation of a European border police service. This study, carried out within the framework of the Odysseus programme, was started in October 2001 and consists of four phases. Its results will be presented at a ministerial conference on 30 May 2002, in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw Mr Posselt’s attention to the content of the global plan for the fight against illegal immigration and human trafficking in the European Union, adopted by the Council on 28 February 2002. The aim of this global plan is to define a common and integrated approach to all issues linked to illegal immigration and human trafficking. There are seven areas for action defined in this plan, which include measures relating to border control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will recall that in Gothenburg the Swedish Presidency tried to reach an agreement over headquarters; that in Laeken, the Belgian Presidency tried once again, and put forward a proposed agreement on headquarters, which was blocked by not only one, but by various countries at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like to tell you, simply, in the intimacy of this hemicycle – which is certainly quite intimate today – that the Spanish Presidency is doing everything it can to put together a package that will allow all countries that aspire to host headquarters of European Agencies – given that to get a particular agency in one’s country appears to be a matter of life of death to all concerned – to come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently holding bilateral talks, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, when he visits the capitals of the Member States before the next European Council, will try to put together a package that can be presented to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to tell you that if this package is not sufficiently solid we are not prepared to go through the tiresome spectacle of watching the Council turn into some kind of souk in which everyone is squabbling over one headquarter or another.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Police College, we already have temporary headquarters. As you are probably aware, as is typically the case in the European Union, temporary headquarters normally end up being the permanent headquarters. I do not mean to say that the Police College will remain permanently in Denmark, but, in truth, there are some temporary headquarters that have been temporary headquarters for forty years now, and, in any case, money has already been allocated for training and we hope that this will come into operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go into precise details right now about which countries are competing for the headquarters, other than to tell you that there are many, and often no-one knows if these countries really want these headquarters or whether they are choosing this option as some kind of decoy or bargaining tool to get something else.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that the less we deal with this issue, the better.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second issue you asked me about, I believe that this falls within the competence of the Commission, which will come to Parliament before the end of June. I hope it will be Mr Vitorino who comes, the Commissioner responsible, who would be the best person to answer your question in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is not a Member of the European Union it is because the Norwegian people have chosen for it not to be, not because we do not want it to be. Therefore, I do not see a problem and I do not think there has ever been an incident on the Norwegian border.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to your statement about soldiers of various nationalities controlling borders, including sensitive borders between Finland and Russia, I would say that this kind of idea really belongs in the realm of science fiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, borders are not guarded by soldiers. Within the EU, borders are controlled by border police. Secondly, it is hard to believe that there are soldiers of different EU nationalities controlling borders that are not their own. A common border police team could possibly be put together, as has been suggested in the Justice and Home Affairs Councils, but this would be a common body of people recruited in the same way that, for example, we recruit a common body of interpreters or officials in this House, that is to say, they would be Community officials bound by their own rules, with their own uniform and language system – which I can see is something you are concerned about – and which will surely have its own distinguishing marks and, most importantly, a code of conduct that will be common to all.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is no more than an idea, however, in the minds of our Justice and Interior Ministers and for the moment does not take any concrete form, and I believe it will take some time to come to fruition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Availability of Council meeting and committee documents</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since the start of the Lisbon procedure the Council, together with the Commission, has become the pivot of a number of coordination procedures. In the committees on economic policy, employment and the labour market and social protection important work is done, which is then discussed and approved by the Council, with no input from Parliament: drafting of common reports by the Council and Commission on employment, exclusion and pensions, as well as on objectives and indicators in the fight against poverty, a subject which also involves pensions. Sometimes, also, the European Council refers to these documents, without their being publicly available. Is the Council prepared to forward these documents drafted by the Commission and the other committees to Parliament? Is it possible to publish documents approved by the Council in the OJ and on the website? Is the Council prepared to collaborate in seeking a procedure which would enable Parliament to be more involved in decision-making under these procedures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that, as you say, Parliament is the body that represents the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that we work within a regulated system where Council is obliged to send documents to Parliament where this is a requirement of the legislative decision-making process. There are some documents that do not relate to the legislative decision-making process, which fall within the competence of the Member States and, with regard to which, there is no requirement to communicate them.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, in today’s European Union, the sky is the limit, because virtually all documents from the Member States are published on the Internet. I would find it very hard to recall any Council, including Councils dealing with the most sensitive issues, such as the Foreign Affairs Councils, in which documents have been kept secret or not made available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are some documents that are sent to Parliament as a matter of course, and there are other documents that, if they are not sent to Parliament as a matter of course, MEPs simply have to ask for, because they are usually available. They are not kept secret and they are available within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, in this regard, that the Internet makes life so much easier these days.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I have made note of this interest – and this is certainly not the first time I have heard it aired in Parliament – in Parliament being more involved in the whole of the Lisbon strategy; and, naturally, in order to be more involved, more information is required and, therefore, I shall pass this on so that we can improve the communication of documents to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is more, will he take back to the further discussions in the Council the advantages of untying aid?

You will be aware that very often there is a series of special credits within the development assistance mechanisms dedicated to financing development assistance projects provided that they favour the implementation or realisation of contacts with companies located in the States.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I do not wish to make an assessment of whether this is a good or a bad thing, it has been an extremely powerful instrument in encouraging countries to allocate large amounts of money to development assistance, and has also been an extremely powerful instrument in encouraging many companies, boosted by these particular credits, to get involved in carrying out projects in countries where, if they had not been provided with these special credits, it would have been extremely risky to have started various projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I would prefer it if this type of link did not exist, and this idea was defended by some countries, and naturally by the Commission, but the reality of a custom and practice that has been in force for many years now won through, and an agreement was not reached on the separation of development assistance from commercial interests.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: United Biscuits' closure of the Fontaneda factory</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 4 April 2002 the multinational company United Biscuits, which owns the Fontaneda biscuit factory in Aguilar de Campo, announced its decision to close the factory without giving any advance notice to workers, who discovered the news in the press. For more than a century, this factory has been producing a make of biscuit which is emblematic in Spain, and without the factory the district and its 8000 inhabitants have no real alternatives for development. Mr Aznar, the current Council President, has said that there is nothing he can do, since multinationals have created many jobs and funded research, even though they create problems on other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council believe that, when multinationals act with complete disregard for the social rights of workers, there is really nothing the EU can do, and does it believe that these statements by its President tally with policy on the social Europe that we aim to build? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the more specific issue of alleviating the negative effects of massive job cuts, in 1975 the Council adopted the Directive on collective redundancies, amended in 1992 and consolidated in 1998, in which specific requirements with regard to information and consultation from company executives were laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it does not fall to the Council, in its capacity as a legislative body, to judge whether the case of United Biscuits, a multinational company, and the Fontaneda biscuits factory would be covered by these Directives or corresponding national legislation, nor if they have failed to respect the social rights of workers in this case. These issues should be resolved by national judicial systems, and I believe that this particular case is already the subject of a judicial inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Council considers that the legal instruments it has adopted should be fully applied in letter and in spirit. If these instruments prove to be insufficient for the purposes of protecting workers’ rights, the Council is willing to study any proposal put forward by the Commission with the aim of improving the aforementioned instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the part of your question that refers to statements made by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, the truth is that it does not fall to the Council to give its opinion in this regard, but I would also like to tell you that Mr Aznar’s government is actively encouraging dialogue with other investors, from Spain and abroad, to find a solution so that biscuit production at the Aguilar de Campoo factory can continue. In view of the latest results from these conversations, all indicators point to the fact that it seems possible that this business can be kept active and viable. The latest stumbling block in the process of maintaining this business and getting it back on its feet, as I am sure you are aware, is the issue of the trademark, given that it belongs to United Biscuits, who still have reservations on handing it over to potential investors who may take over the factory.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, with or without the trademark, there are various groups of investors that are clearly interested, who shall be given every facility to prevent this factory, in a town so small as Aguilar de Campoo, from having to close, which would have a very serious effect on the inhabitants of this town. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are the driving force behind social and economic development in this whole area, which is located in a European Objective 1 region with serious depopulation problems, where, in 2001, 1 500 people have already lost their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The announcement of the closure – and it seems that today the company has put this right – was purely in business interests and would naturally mean that jobs would have to be relocated, which shows genuine contempt for workers’ rights, and furthermore the fictitious transfer of the trademark in order to keep producing these biscuits in a location other than the one it has been historically linked to.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is too serious for the President-in-Office of the Council to say that nothing can be done. It would have been more reasonable had he been concerned about the social consequences of these business decisions and the need for the European Union to confront the challenge of establishing Community principles that respect the social rights of workers, and that offer effective responses to the social, economic and territorial consequences of these decisions.</p>

It is neither the Council nor the President-in-Office of the Council’s duty to make any judgement on rules that have been adopted. The Commission has power of initiative and the rules adopted by the Council have to be adopted by the judges.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that you are insisting on some kind of statement by the President-in-Office of the Council, I would tell you that this statement cannot be taken out of context. To say that government should respect the business decisions of multinational companies is one thing, but to exempt these multinationals from their duty to conform to current legislation is quite another. In any case, United Biscuits has not been exempted. Current legislation has to apply to this company or any other company for that matter. Therefore, current legislation must be applied. If the legislation is insufficient, the Commission will have to put forward a new proposal, and we will give it our total support, and, in the meantime, I believe that the attitude shown by the Spanish Government – to immediately seek investors to resolve the problem, which has already had a result – shows that the Government’s will is precisely in tune with social concerns and that it wishes to prevent the closure of this factory.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure you, Mrs Rodríguez<span class="bold">, </span>that this factory is not going to close. It is not going to close, not only because of the will of the people and of the workers, but also because of the will of the Government, which is fully aware that this closure would be an enormous social injustice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
