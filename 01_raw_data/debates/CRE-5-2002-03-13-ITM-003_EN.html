<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piqué,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank this House for giving me the opportunity to speak, on behalf of the Council, on the current state of transatlantic relations. I believe this reveals Parliament’s sensitivity with regard to the European Union’s foreign policy and, moreover, it is a timely initiative in view of the events of recent months and the forthcoming Summit meeting between the European Union and the United States, the first since 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the United States are partners with a shared history that cannot be denied. I use this term not only to describe the longevity of this relationship but also as a graphic illustration of its importance and unique nature. The relationship between the European Union and the United States is based on strong and long-standing ties between our respective peoples and governments, and rests on fundamental values such as the respect for human rights, personal freedom, the rule of law, a democratic form of government and the system of free trade. Experience has shown on many occasions that, when the European Union and the United States act together in harmony, we can make a decisive contribution to generating a positive dynamic for world change, fostering the establishment of democratic regimes, seeking greater trade and investment opportunities, reducing poverty in less favoured societies, or overseeing environmental protection on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Going beyond our political and economic ties, the events of 11 September are a constant reminder of the value that both Europeans and Americans attach to the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for people’s rights that shape our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of an introduction, I should like to remind you of the terms in which the Spanish Presidency expressed its priorities for its current six-month term with regard to transatlantic relations – and I shall quote directly here: ‘11 September has strengthened even further, if that is possible, the indissoluble nature of Europe’s intended integration with the transatlantic relationship. Now is the time to remind the younger generations of Europeans that this prosperous and peaceful Europe that we know exists partly because of the generosity and solidarity of many Americans when, not so long ago, Europe was no more than a battlefield and, after that, a continent in ruins. Now it is our turn to show such solidarity. During its Presidency of the Union, Spain will push this vigorously’.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than twenty-four hours after the odious attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September, the European Union expressed its total solidarity with the United States Government and the American people. On 20 September, the European Union and the United States committed themselves to work together within a broad coalition to combat the scourge of terrorism. We thus made a joint commitment to lead a hitherto unheard of cooperative effort on a global scale, aimed at eliminating the terrorist threat and its leaders, networks and organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This determination reflects the strength of our transatlantic relationship, our shared values and our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder against the challenges posed by fanaticism and intolerance. Together with the United States, we are committed to the security and well-being of our citizens, and we shall spare no effort to protect our societies from the terrorist threat. We shall keep a special watch to ensure that the freedom of the individual and the rule of law are always scrupulously upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency accords the highest priority to furthering this cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism, particularly with a view to European Union-United States Ministerial meeting that will take place in Madrid on 10 April and the EU-US Summit to be held in Washington on 2 May. We can be proud of the efforts that we and our American counterparts have made in this regard over the last few months, but satisfaction with what has been achieved must not distract us from the long road that still lies ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs which met in Santiago de Compostela on 14 February, there has been a consensus for the Presidency to ask the Council for a negotiation mandate to conclude an extradition agreement and a mutual legal assistance agreement on criminal matters, based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency wants to present the Council with a draft mandate so that it can announce its decision on 25 April. We are aware that this mandate must be clear and flexible and must represent added value compared with the current situation, and it must of course comply with the limits laid down by the constitutions of the Member States and the procedural guarantees inherent in European values.</p>
<p class="contents">International affairs are another fundamental element in the exchange of information and points of view that form part of transatlantic dialogue. This dialogue on CFSP matters seeks greater coordination of our positions on matters of great importance – including security and defence policy – and viable solutions to international conflicts. For example, amongst other issues, we have been and still are analysing the conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East every day, at various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last fifty years, the European Union and the United States have helped create and develop the rules and institutions responsible for promoting peace and prosperity within many different international forums, including the United Nations, NATO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation. For two generations the Europe-America link has ensured peace in our continent, and now, when Europe is closer than ever to achieving its dream of reunification, we bear the responsibility of maintaining and expanding our understanding with the United States, renewing our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder against the demands and challenges of the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union and the United States also share one of the most complex, rich and varied economic and trading relationships in the world. Trade between us is worth almost EUR 1 200 million every day, representing roughly 37% of world trade in commodities and 45% of trade in services. Direct investment by the European Union in the United States stands at approximately EUR 675 000 million. Three million jobs there depend directly on this investment, and one out of every twelve American workers is paid by a European company. I must emphatically point out that the vast majority of these trade and investment links are carried out openly and without any obstacles, and when this does not happen we prefer consultation and dialogue as the most suitable means of resolving our differences, in a constant and sometimes far from simple effort to find practical, swift and balanced solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision adopted at the WTO meeting of Ministers, held in Doha last November, to initiate negotiations for a new multilateral trade round is a clear example of the beneficial effects of European-American cooperation, which can overcome our divergent aims and interests for the sake of a greater common goal. At the same time, however, we must not be surprised if the complexity of our economic and trade relations causes disagreements and disputes, which, despite their relatively minor impact when compared with the total volume of trade, can sometimes take on considerable importance. Such disputes at times play a leading role and strongly influence the debates led by leading politicians and also the media. In contrast, few people remember our ability to reach compromises and solutions to past controversies. The banana conflict is one example I can mention, which remained with us for a long time until it was finally resolved quite recently.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our objectives, therefore, is to provide a new, positive focus that can enhance and develop bilateral trade. This positive side of things is all too often overshadowed by the prominence accorded to disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency underlines the need to use the as yet untapped potential of commercial relations to transcend any process of crisis and confrontation and transform it into a process of cooperation. I am convinced that, in this way, we shall be able to address other ongoing disputes, such as those of the Foreign Sales Corporations or genetically modified organisms, or the more recent dispute on the trade in steel.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I must specifically mention the appearance of this new disagreement with the United States, as a consequence of the decision announced on 5 March to impose safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products. The imposition of tariffs of up to 30%, depending on the case, reflects a worrying trend in the United States towards unilateral protectionist options that ruin the efforts that the European Union and other producing countries made in Paris under the auspices of the OECD. It is a very unfortunate precedent at these times, which are so important for the fate of the new multilateral trade round. All the Member States and the Council support the measures adopted by the Commission, and in particular the policy being implemented by Commissioner Lamy.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure you that the Presidency takes this matter very seriously and, with regard to future developments, it will remain in close contact with the Commission and the Member States, determined to adopt appropriate measures whenever necessary to safeguard the interests of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is understandable that Europeans and Americans sometimes have different views on major international issues, but that must not hold back our commitment to try to act together, and I shall give you an example that I think demonstrates this clearly: the Monterrey Conference. We managed to reach a consensus between the European Union and the United States, which all countries worldwide have also agreed to. I believe this is a good precedent and an incentive in the run-up to Johannesburg. This is not the case in the environmental field, however, where the European Union has just taken an important step forwards in ratifying the Kyoto Protocol at the last Council meeting of Ministers for the Environment only a few days ago, whereas the United States, with the adoption of the recent programme announced by President Bush, seems to be moving further away from this goal. Even in this case, however, when our positions seem so far apart, the Presidency believes in building bridges and, in the next few weeks, we shall be holding a high-level meeting within the working party set up at the Gothenburg transatlantic summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will finish here. The opportunities that each of us has to influence the others’ actions positively and for the benefit of all are by no means negligible, and the European Union, which is ever more European and ever more united, must fully accept its responsibility as the friend and ally of the United States. The Presidency will therefore do its utmost to ensure that our relations with the United States are fully developed and, together with the Member States and the Commission, it will spare no effort to make the summit planned for 2 May in Washington satisfy both sides’ expectations. In this context, the contributions to be made today in this sitting of the European Parliament will be of fundamental importance, and I thank you for them in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Council Presidency started by making some general points on the state of transatlantic relations and spoke about our trade relations before concluding with the steel issue. I will take these points in reverse, not to contradict the Presidency – quite the opposite; I think that we are working very well together – but because inevitably the Commission is more preoccupied with recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start then with steel. As you all know, last week we witnessed the latest outbreak of steel protectionism, a chronic illness suffered by American trade policy which stands in total contradiction to the Bush administration's rhetoric in favour of free trade. Once again, the United States has on this occasion reinvented what we might call intermittent free trade: one day it works, the next day it does not. Well, on 6 March it was not working.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures announced by President Bush in relation to steel are clearly political. They have no legal or economic foundation, and we Europeans, who paid the socially and financially heavy price for restructuring in the Eighties and Nineties, know that it is necessary to adopt this course of action in order to adapt and become competitive. The United States has chosen the opposite approach: rather than tackling the problems at the heart of their steel industry – and these are considerable – they are forcing the outside world to bear the burden of the visible symptoms of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We know perfectly well that it is not acceptable to blame imports for all of the difficulties faced by the American steel industry, even if globally there is still surplus capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, these decisions are intended to transfer the burden of restructuring the American steel industry onto the rest of the world, and in particular onto us. We are probably the main victim of these measures, given our export flows and the quality of the products which we have been exporting to the United States. This is the first, direct consequence of the measures. In addition, we are threatened by a second consequence, which is indirect and probably on a considerably larger scale, since these measures threaten to divert a good proportion of the steel products which no longer have access to the American market onto the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is going to adopt all of the measures at its disposal in this field to protect both its industry and its jobs. Unlike the United States, we are quite simply going to abide strictly by the international commitments which we have signed up to.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course going to bring the issue before the WTO so as to obtain a condemnation of the American measures. We will not be doing this on our own: this is not a conflict between the European Union and the United States; it is a much broader conflict because these measures are going to disrupt the steel market throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the WTO safeguard clause, which provide that such measures may only be implemented if imports have shown a sharp and substantial increase, which is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also going to ask the Americans to take measures to compensate us for the European exports hit by the American measures and, depending on their reaction, we will see whether it is desirable or conceivable to suspend our tariff concessions to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">After all – and this is the most important thing – we need to protect our own market against the risk of a deflection of trade in steel products which, as I have said, will no longer be able to enter the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have initiated all of the procedures to this end and we are going to take measures which are commensurate with the risks posed by this influx of imports. For a number of weeks now, we have had an early warning system for imports in place. We are therefore ready. We had taken the necessary precautions. We will take these measures in full compliance with WTO rules. We will not close our market to steel imports. We simply wish to ensure that all of the steel products originally destined for the United States do not overflow onto the European market, and we will ensure that our own measures enter into force at the precise moment when the American measures closing their market take effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Why stick to the rules when, in this case, the Americans have clearly decided to disregard them? Because we do not consider the world market to be the Wild West, where anyone can act as they see fit. There are rules and regulations which here, as in other cases, guarantee the smooth functioning of the multilateral system, and we think, taking our lead from the Council and this House, that the medium and long-term interests of the Union are best served by ensuring the smooth functioning of a regulated multilateral system. In Europe we have a steel industry which is restructured, productive, strong and competitive. It is therefore in our interests to apply clear ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Union is being hit by unjust and unfounded measures. The Commission, in close collaboration with all of the stakeholders – the Council, Parliament, the metallurgical industry and its unions – has decided to respond vigorously using all of the means at its disposal. We are going to protect our companies and our jobs from the potentially devastating indirect effects of these measures and we will continue to hammer home our argument that the American decision is bad for the American economy, bad for our steel industry and bad for world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events should not make us lose sight of the broader picture where our trade relations are concerned. Like the President-in-Office of the Council, I consider these to be generally of high quality and to represent the greatest volume of bilateral trade and investment in the world. These trade disputes which sometimes hit the headlines only concern, let us remember, a limited proportion of our trade. We also have a more positive agenda to manage with the United States, on both a multilateral and bilateral level.</p>
<p class="contents">I will pass quickly over the multilateral aspect. I believe that it was clearly demonstrated in Doha, as Mr Piqué has just said, that when the United States and the European Union work side by side on a number of issues, if not on all of them, they secure promising multilateral decisions, such as the launch of a new trade round as agreed in Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us dwell more on the bilateral side. Of course we always have bilateral priorities for the Transatlantic Economic Partnership and we continue to support the idea that we need to work together on positive measures to boost bilateral trade. This is not always easy. We need to show tenacity and think in the medium and long term about mutual recognition, regulatory cooperation, food safety or data protection. In many cases we have achieved results, even if all of these subjects do not always capture the imagination of the press. We need to reflect on other initiatives which might have a little more political resonance or visibility, so as to breathe new life into a transatlantic agenda which some of you now consider to have become too much of a ritual, even sometimes to have run out of steam altogether. We are open to ideas and we have some of our own. We are working, for example, on negotiating a possible transatlantic agreement in the field of air transport – we are looking forward to the Court's ruling – on cooperating on intellectual property and on more extensive harmonisation of regulations on accounting, finance and insurance. In addition, with a view to the next transatlantic summit, we have started considering the advisability of taking initiatives in this field. Personally, I am in favour of such initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we need to manage other conflicts where we are divided by matters other than steel, and there are a number of them. The issue of hormones in beef is not completely settled, even if promising negotiations have been started. The clementines matter has still not been resolved and neither have the dispute over duty-free American exports nor the case of foreign sales corporations, which is obviously significant. Our policy in these matters remains clear: we need to respect the international rules. This is true for us as it is for the Americans, and in the case of the tax-related subsidies for exports the United States has already undertaken to abide by the rules. We will use all of the means at our disposal to ensure that they do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close by addressing the general state of transatlantic relations, which the Council Presidency has already commented on at length. I believe that 11 September had actually raised hopes that the United States' diplomacy and international attitude were going to become a little more multilateral. We are obliged, I believe, to conclude that this is not the case and that the few signs of unilateralism which we observed prior to 11 September – the agreement on the International Criminal Court, the ABM Treaty, Kyoto – have not gone away, indeed quite the contrary. The Commission considers that if, in the light of recent events, any changes are required, then they probably consist more than ever in the need to have strong multilateral institutions and greater implementation of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message which we try to get over to our American counterparts at our meetings. Together we need to consider the challenges, excesses, possibilities and risks presented by globalisation, and together we need to foster cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world. The next key date will be the transatlantic summit on 2 May. On this occasion we will spare no effort to try and relaunch a number of collaborative projects between the United States and Europe, on the fight against drugs, on judicial cooperation and, why not, on preparing for the Johannesburg Summit, when I believe that the world will need both the United States and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their comments this morning. I believe that we have reached one of those critical stages in the development of the transatlantic relationship in its global context.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, looking at the overall relationship, it is quite clear – as our two speakers have said – that since 11 September 2001 we have seen a significant change in the way in which the Americans view their place in the world. We see an America under attack – one which we recognised on 12 September in this House, but which perhaps we now fail to recognise six months on.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are in danger of seeing an unravelling of the security side of our relationship, where a political consensus underlying NATO cannot now be taken for granted for out-of-area responsibilities. We see the military gap widening and perhaps difficulties also in expanding NATO operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the strong impetus that came with the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda now appears to be under threat because of a lack of political vision and, perhaps, frustration at the lack of results among many of the parties involved in the dialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific case of steel, I can only welcome the comments made by the Commissioner in deploring the US decision. The Commission should take action to seek compensation, and look for legal means of taking retaliatory action. I would also add that it would be very unhelpful, as Mr Aldonas at the Department of Commerce in the United States has suggested, for the US to link this steel dispute to the wider issue of problems in the global economy. That surely is not the way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I come to what we might be able to do in the present context. It is indeed tempting to think of taking retaliatory action through tariffs. However, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> stated on 7 March, in Bush's folly, tariff walls would amount to an own goal. It would simply be a futile effort by the Americans to preserve unviable jobs in steel. Surely, therefore, we should be looking for a broader transatlantic partnership in which to define Europe's role and America's role and build on our common interests together. As regards NATO, that means ensuring that we can move NATO on to more global responsibilities. Furthermore, your meeting on 2 May at the EU/US Summit to update the New Transatlantic Agenda to meet new challenges must ensure that the political communities are properly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is up to you to provide leadership. We must be tough and take the necessary action to protect our interests in this steel dispute, but also think of the broader context and form a vision of how the transatlantic partnership should look in the 21st century.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the framework for our transatlantic relations, I believe we have to start with the current framework, which is the Madrid Declaration of December 1995, issued under the Spanish Presidency. I do not recall that the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned this declaration, which defines our framework; I do not know whether that is because a Socialist government adopted it, but in any case, as it was the Presidency of the Union, I recommend that he should take it into account this May, and Mr Elles will not deny this since we worked together at the time for the Spanish Government to push this very important declaration through the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I really must say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I believe this declaration should be brought up to date, for various reasons. First, because of the situation since 11 September: we have not merely shown our solidarity with the United States, but we have also adopted measures. In this fight, however, as in all others – I must be frank about this – we are allies, but we have to work together on an equal footing, and our American allies – as some ministers in the Union have said – must understand that we are equals and subservience has no place here, which means that we must not systematically bow to unilateral decisions. This applies to many things. We have to act jointly in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans; it is to be hoped that the United States will reconsider their position on Kyoto and especially with regard to certain worrying announcements by the Bush Administration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific question of the steel issue, which the Commissioner, Mr Lamy, has developed further, we believe that we must adopt a firm stance and we also support taking reprisal measures. We do not understand why, for example, the United States trade representative, Mr Zoellick, is today developing the worldwide international conspiracy theory to say that the United States is being attacked through steel imports. The history of the European Union began with the Coal and Steel Community, which was a restructuring process. I understand that Mr Bush wants to win elections, but what the Americans have to do is restructure their steel industry, which will demand sacrifice, and we should not have to pay for the restructuring of American industry. We have to make this quite plain and, in addition, there are proposals such as applying a 2% surcharge so as to be able to restructure the industry. What does not make sense is that we should have to pay this, when in this Parliament we systematically have to deal with the banana war, hormones and GMOs, and we always have to check the list to see what reprisal measures we can take within the bounds of our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our American friends and allies have to understand that we cannot go on working like this, and we therefore call on the Commission to take the strongest line possible to make them see reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the announcement last week was bad enough. The comments from some US officials, including Mr Aldonas, that somehow protectionism is warranted to correct wider macroeconomic factors is potentially even worse. It displays a dangerous and economically illiterate philosophy that needs to be strongly rebuffed. The question is: how do we rebuff it?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to ensure that we consolidate our friendships with those allies with whom we wish to act together against American unilateralism. And if there is one tactical concern my group has about brandishing safeguard measures against those steel exports that might be diverted from the US to Europe, it is that it might actually alienate countries such as Russia, India and Brazil, with whom we have to act together in the WTO and the OECD to take on this American move. Therefore, we would ask the Commission and, of course, the Council, as a matter of urgency to try and negotiate bilateral voluntary export restraint agreements with these countries, so as to avoid the diversion from steel going to America to Europe happening in the first place. The obvious danger if we do not achieve this is that we end up having spats with precisely the people we should be teaming up with against this American behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is this: let us not be squeamish; this decision was taken for domestic political reasons. It will only be reversed or limited if domestic political pressures dictate that should be the case. In order to do that, we need to brandish big sticks which are felt on the domestic US political scene. And conveniently enough, if inelegantly, we do have such a big stick, in the form of the measures we can take within the context of the foreign sales cooperation dispute. Of course, we do not wish to mix these things formally; but let us not be naive. The FSC dispute provides us with the best means by which to inflict the domestic pressure which is absolutely necessary in order to get some change in the American attitude and to reassert the international rule of law, rather than the rule of the law of George Bush's economic jungle.</p>

But let there be no mistake: 11 September has accelerated a process that was started long before, namely the forging of a new alliance between the EU and the United States. Many structural causes play a role in this: the EU’s stronger, enhanced role as an economic superpower, the end of the Cold War and, related to this, a shift in the role for the United States in Europe. The EU is no longer America’s kid brother who is proud to walk in its shadow. But neither has the EU become, I hope, the adolescent who wishes to follow in the footsteps of its great example. The EU must carve its own role in a self-assured manner. The EU must not shy away from conflict, and should not be frightened to show that it disagrees with the United States if that is the case. Above all, the EU should not try to emulate the United States. Allow me to illustrate this with two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the sharp increase in defence budgets by an amount which far outstrips the budgets of France and Great Britain put together. Does this mean that the European Union should increase its defence budgets accordingly? Not in my view, because it is completely futile to try to bridge the difference in the belief that we will be a more credible partner if we do. It is up to the European Union to consider a credible mix of military means, but, above all, to consider matters which the European Union is good at: conflict prevention, crisis management and nation building. Macedonia and Afghanistan are good examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">May I venture to quote American President Roosevelt who said: ‘Let us speak softly, let them carry a big stick? But the bearing of arms is also subject to restrictions, and these restrictions are exceeded in the US plans, which have now been leaked, concerning the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for the United States not to cut back the role of nuclear weapons, which is what we want, but instead they cast them in a new role in a new strategy, lower the threshold for their use and allow the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons to become blurred. This is a development against which the European Union should not be afraid to protest. The blurring of the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons is a dangerous development, and we all know that the threat of nuclear weapons would only hamper the search for solutions in Iraq or Iran, for example. It makes no sense whatsoever to use this threat, and we must not be frightened to say so. What is more, the French and British governments should be urged to clarify once and for all their stance on nuclear weapons. As far as my group is concerned, the answer is quite simple: nuclear weapons have no role to play in future European security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to quote the Middle East as a final example. Needless to say, it is preferable to keep a diplomatic offensive together with the Americans. We should do this, but we should not wait for the United States. The European Union can play its own role not only diplomatically, but mainly economically. This will give us a unique opportunity to step up the pressure on both sides, and we are also committed to ensuring that our own human rights policy remains credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union is an economic superpower which is trying to carve a role for itself in the world. We will succeed in this if we speak with one voice, if we do not shy away from open criticism of other superpowers and, above all, if we do not try to emulate the United States. The European Union is not a military superpower which can impose its wishes all over the world all by itself, and neither should we want this. Neither is the EU a naïve Maecenas, who pays up once the United States has done the dirty work. The United States should obviously be able to keep the peace in its own backyard, also militarily. Apart from this, we should mainly focus on what we are good at: to talk and talk again, to strike compromises and to pay up eventually. The EU needs the United States if things get out of hand, but the United States needs the EU to ensure that things do not get too out of hand.</p>

However, I am also particularly grateful to Mr Lagendijk for identifying the key events so clearly. I do not think that it makes any sense to dub the problems in current relations with the USA as ‘cowardice in the face of amity’. I believe that it is urgently necessary, indeed I would even say that it is of the utmost urgency, to discuss transatlantic relations in a very open way. And that is the point, Mr President-in-Office, where there is a difference that has not been mentioned and that you did not touch upon. It seems that at present we do not have the courage to admit to ourselves that the role of the European Union in international relations is undoubtedly at risk because of this. We do not have the courage to admit that there are differences between us and the USA. We do not have the courage to admit that you can hardly say there is a common foreign and security policy at present. There are also significant developments beyond steel which will have serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I am certainly pleased that the business community in Europe has at least aired its differences of opinion and not just expressed unreserved support. There is the issue of withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and the issue of unilateral declarations involving clear legal violations. The problem in such cases is that those who have their headphones on hear, whilst those who stand around chatting do not get the message at all.</p>
<p class="contents">So the United States has made a unilateral decision concerning the non-proliferation treaty. They are blocking controls on biological weapons. The United States is dismantling the control organisation for the chemical weapons treaty. There has been an announcement about withdrawal from the space weapons treaty. There have been violations of international humanitarian law, the withdrawal from Kyoto, and the non-ratification of the international protocol on the International Criminal Court. I do not want to say that this all adds up to a negative picture, but it is nevertheless clear that there are very big differences between the US and Europe here, and I can only agreed with what Mr Lagendijk has said about nuclear weapons. I am certain that that the plans of the US and probably Russia as well contain even more macabre scenarios, but the point of their becoming public knowledge is evidently to humiliate Russia, which has recently been so zealous in its support for the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to call on the European Union to counter this trend towards genuine multilateralism and the strengthening of the UN, and it should take advantage of its position as a civilian power, a power that practises preventive conflict resolution, and it should actually develop a common foreign policy. The most important condition for this is that, regardless of everything we have in common, we should ensure that these differences are not allowed to be hidden in a kind of European policy blind spot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Today marks a critical time in the transatlantic relations which, six months after the direct terrorist attacks on the US, are straining under intense pressure. This is mainly caused by the further development of the international anti-terrorist coalition. As with the Islamic terrorist network of Al Qaida, President Bush is issuing serious military warnings to potential terrorist States. For support of this bold approach, the American Head of State is making an urgent appeal to all coalition members. It is precisely this appeal which is stirring up very mixed emotions in European quarters. The standard European reproach of American unilateralism, which dates back to before 11 September, is once again being uttered.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this familiar European reproach addressed to Washington is rooted in a fundamental weakness on our side. Indeed, recent analyses have clearly shown that the military and technological chasm between the transatlantic allies is widening at an alarming pace. The European NATO Member States carry increasingly less military weight. There is no doubt that this imbalance within NATO promotes American unilateralism in the area of security. The scenes of battle in Afghanistan bear witness to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, for Europe to be a force to be reckoned with on the international scene, without jeopardising its own security, it needs to make a credible defence contribution to NATO and to outline a coherent, viable Euro-Atlantic security concept as a matter of urgency, on pain of being ostracised internationally and of being isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the steel conflict that has broken out between the US and the EU, there is no reasonable excuse for this example of uninhibited American protectionism and unilateralism in terms of trade. Passing on the weakness of its own steel industry to that of other countries by levying a 30% import tariff for three years only steps up the tension in transatlantic relations. In addition, this one-sided American government measure jeopardises the new trade round within the WTO. Above all, the intervention has an adverse effect on the American economy: the protection of 9 000 jobs in the American steel industry translates into a possible loss of no fewer than 75 000 jobs in other economic sectors due to higher steel prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we go from here? A trade war between the US and the EU would undoubtedly come at the worst conceivable time politically speaking. Attempts to settle the dispute within WTO are therefore much to be preferred, for example, through a serious European contribution towards relaxing and reinforcing transatlantic relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a direct result of the unforgivable spamming of our system by a certain Dr Rath of Germany, who appears to have considerable interests in the matter of vitamin therapy on which we are voting this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Several times in this House I have protested about this totally unacceptable invasion of our system, which has no place here and is causing serious problems for Members. I would like to reassure Members that we are doing our very best to take action in this regard. I would also repeat that all Members are entitled to request a filter for their system if they are being annoyed by these e-mails, which will then be removed. However, the ubiquitous Dr Rath – wherever he is, and I suspect he is in this House – has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through, making it very difficult for our services to block these e-mails. We would have blocked them if we could have done so. However, each individual Member can request a filter on his or her machine to prevent these completely counter-productive e-mails from coming in.</p>

But I have spoken with organisations in the UK and Ireland this morning who are clearly as frustrated as we are. I may be paranoid, but I wonder whether industry is behind this attempt to get a reaction from Members of Parliament. Clearly, though, the organisations I am working with have tried desperately hard to stop this campaign of spamming our e-mail systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
