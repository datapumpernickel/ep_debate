<p class="contents">I should like to say that the European Union civil protection mechanism was activated 11 times in the first few months of this year, intervening on request in the floods in various European countries in the spring, especially in the countries which requested it, namely Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and, outside the European Union, Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we recently had the crisis in Lebanon and the associated problems created by the hostilities. Both Lebanon and Cyprus requested intervention by the European Union on three issues:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly with the provision of humanitarian assistance for refugees and displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly with evacuation: the removal from Lebanon of citizens from European Union countries, their transportation to Cyprus, their reception there and their subsequent repatriation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem which arose was the problem of contamination by the oil slick following the bombing of the oil tanks in south Lebanon and the fact that approximately 10 to 15 thousand tonnes of oil spilled on to the shore and then into the sea, polluting the entire coast of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">In this instance, the European Union immediately sent experts both to Cyprus and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we mobilised the civil protection mechanisms in the European countries, coordinated the aid mission and addressed the more specific problem of transporting humanitarian aid, given that certain countries offering aid did not have any means of transportation, which is a specific problem which needs to be examined in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as I already mentioned, European citizens and third country citizens were transported as quickly as possible from Cyprus to their own countries. This was a very difficult operation if you imagine that about 45 000 citizens from other countries abandoned Lebanon, went to Cyprus and had to be repatriated. The European Union, with the civil protection mechanism, coordinated transportation, with aeroplanes scheduled to arrive so that the citizens of the various countries had to remain in Cyprus as little as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out and emphasise the exceptional efficiency with which the Cyprus authorities and a great many volunteers dealt with this crisis, with our participation, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The third major problem was the problem of the oil slick. As I said earlier, we immediately sent experts, who are still there, given that this is an ongoing problem: for a time the surrounding countries were threatened, but they were not ultimately contaminated and at present the experts are trying with various pumps and materials sent by countries of the European Union and third countries, such as Norway, to improve the situation and to clean up the shores.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this summer we had fires in various European countries, such as Greece, France and Portugal, and very extensive fires in Spain. Of these countries, Spain asked for help from the European Union and, within a few hours of the Spanish Government's request, fire-fighting 'planes, fire engines and firemen were offered by various European countries and, with the help of the European Union, action by the Spanish Government and a change in the weather and rainfall, the fire was finally put out.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we had a major problem in Ethiopia, with floods which continue to threaten the country; we had hundreds of deaths and several thousand refugees. Experts and specialists from the European Union are there and countries in the European Union have offered certain supplies and materials to deal with the emergency in this country which, I would emphasise, is still in a state of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, numerous countries in the European Union sent aid through the civil protection mechanism to Indonesia following the earthquake last May.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say on the subject of the fires, given that this is an issue of great interest, that the Commission is not competent for all forest-related matters: these are matters for the Member States and it is the Member States which determine the policies used to protect forests, prevent fires and address all associated, forest-related problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies at European level are designed to strengthen the Member States' corresponding policies. They also include the funding programmes which we have and which are available either from the new rural development mechanism, the Forest Focus Directive, which will have the facility to finance action to protect forests, or from the new LIFE+ programme, which makes express provision for financing for various activities which used to be financed under the Forest Focus Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we also have the civil protection action programme, which can be used to finance – and is financing – certain activities to protect forests.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in matters of civil protection from natural disasters we can never be satisfied. Many crises and natural disasters cannot be averted. However, we can be better prepared. Although the civil protection mechanism has proven that it adds value and that it is very important, there is a great deal of room for improvement, a great deal of room to make it more effective. On this matter I should like to thank the European Parliament for its constant support, for strengthening the civil protection mechanism, and I am certain that this evening's debate will help in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gerardo Galeote, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (ES) </span>Mr President, the Commission is here today to attend this debate in the European Parliament on the initiative of my group and I would therefore like to begin by thanking the other groups that have supported this initiative, thereby making it possible for us to hold this debate today. I would, of course, also like to thank the Commissioner for being here and above all for his work and commitment in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, certain Members have told us quite legitimately that we are doing the same as we did a year ago, that we are in the same situation as last summer. I would like to respond to them by saying that that is not true: it is true that we debated fires in September last year as well; it is true that we visited the areas affected together with some of our fellow Members who are here today – and not without difficulties created by certain bodies in this House, incidentally; and it is true that we held a hearing in which victims’ families were able to express themselves in an emotional manner to all of us, but we are not in the same situation, because, since then, the European Parliament has presented clear and concrete initiatives and proposals to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, within the framework of the Berend report, this House approved a raft of amendments aimed at updating the European Union’s Solidarity Fund. We have also asked the European Commission for a specific directive on fires and on drought, since there is a directive on floods, and we have asked the Council for a committed response to the report by former Commissioner Barnier, which was presented at the last European Council, as everybody knows.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not, therefore, and nor should we be, in the same situation as a year ago. We have a package of proposals which should make us much more effective in combating fires. What we have not had is a reaction from the Council, and that fact can be attributed as much to the Presidencies we have had this year, which have done practically nothing, as to those Member States most affected that have not asked for anything. Certain competent public authorities use the drought, or the deliberately caused fires, as an excuse for this failure. It is true that there is drought and it is true that there are criminals, as there have been in the past, but we should be asking those authorities what they have done this year in the field of prevention and whether, when the inevitable has happened, there has been proper coordination inside and outside of their borders.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Commissioner referred to the most significant fire of this summer: the one that took place in Galicia. I would like to ask you when you formally received the request for assistance from the Spanish Government, and on precisely what date you were formally asked to activate the civil protection mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are simply asking for more prevention and more coordination. We are not talking about inventing resources or funds that do not exist. We are simply asking that the European Union’s Solidarity Fund be applied, which would have been much easier, by the way, if the European Parliament’s proposals had been taken into account. Nor are we asking for greater powers for the European Union, but rather for more planning and more coordination while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Let us see whether, while helping those who most need it now, we can ensure that we do not have to repeat this debate next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is because, like the floods in central Europe, ladies and gentlemen, the fires in southern Europe are a recurring environmental emergency. Their causes have been very well studied: more than 80% are caused by human actions, either negligent or wilful, with a deliberate intention to cause damage.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about how a fire starts, however. How a fire starts is one thing, but its spread, the area burnt, is quite another. Other factors are at play here. The weather, for example, which this year was very extreme with very strong winds, very high temperatures, and little or no rainfall, or the state of the countryside which, for socio-economic reasons, has been abandoned, and is full of highly combustible undergrowth that helps fires to spread, as well as the planting of inappropriate forest species and the abandonment for decades of a genuine forestry policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the countries of the Mediterranean south, huge amounts have been invested in fire-fighting resources. Throughout southern Europe we have very efficient extinguishing mechanisms, but the resources are never sufficient: suffice it to say that this summer in Galicia, ladies and gentlemen, there have been more than 7 000 people and more than 60 aircraft dedicated to putting the fires out, but how can they fight 300 fires every day?</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, what we Socialists are asking from the Commission is very clear. On the one hand, that the Commission facilitate the application in this case of the Solidarity Fund by means of the political criterion: we want the Solidarity Fund to be applied to the affected populations and regions in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also asking for two other things. One relates to Forest Focus. We have established a warning system that is effective, but insufficient. It is effective in that it allows us to identify areas of climate risk or quite simply areas at risk of natural disaster, but it does not indicate the areas of socio-economic risk. We Socialists argue that, behind these fires, there lies the serious abandonment of the more traditional farming practices and also the ageing of the population currently living in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also asking you to mobilise the European forestry strategy. We believe that Commissioner Dimas must find the money and the instruments to create effective policies aimed at keeping people in the countryside by means of that plan or that forestry strategy and also at maintaining and extending our areas of forest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we are facing fires or floods though, we in the European Union carry on acting as if each one were an isolated event that did not deserve or require a genuine global approach and, in some people’s view, as if they did not have a genuine European dimension. That is absurd. It is because of that lack of an overall view and of policies consistent with that overall view that we do not have a real range of instruments for combating them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are in fact three dimensions to this kind of disaster that must be tackled. The first is the emergency situation itself, and here the European Union can do much more than it is currently doing; the European Union could do much more to strengthen its measures for responding rapidly to civil protection crises, but it is not doing so; specifically, the European Union, in this case the Council, rejected or continues to reject the idea of implementing what was proposed to it in the Barnier report, with specific proposals on the creation of a European civil protection response service, and that is what needs to be set up for pure emergency situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, however, after the immediate coordinated response to the emergency, which does not work, because the planning instruments do not exist or have not been properly implemented, we naturally need subsequent assistance for those affected. That is the second element that we need to take into account. This is where my group agrees with the request from other groups, stressing the importance of mobilising the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, since that is what it was created for, with a political outlook – obeying its rules, of course, but with a political outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">A fire or a flood, and in this case I am referring specifically to the situation in Galicia, completely destroys the already scant resources that a region needs for its development. It is therefore obvious that we are facing a situation that requires the urgent application of the Solidarity Fund, in order to assist those populations and that territory which, in tourism and economic terms, have seen their source of income reduced to ashes – and in this case I mean that quite literally.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the third dimension, in order to try to ensure that the first and the second are not repeated, although we can never prevent everything. I am talking, of course, about prevention. We need a genuine European forestry policy, which does not exist because it is still fragmented. Since Forest Focus was drawn up, there have been more fires covering larger areas. We hope that the European Commission will take this into account in the report that it has to produce before the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Biomass needs to be promoted. We truly have to take seriously the consequences of warming in this case and the rise in temperatures. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development must take account of the consequences for the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">In that way, the situation will change and we will no longer have to face problems such as this after the summer every year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come to replace the rhetoric with practical measures to ensure that the summer is not transformed into an inferno that destroys protected forests and landscapes and the lives and property of the thousands of people who courageously continue to live in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in August in Portugal was particularly serious; tens of thousands of hectares of forest were burnt, a number of people died, an important environmental heritage site in the Peneda-Gerês and Serras d'Aire e Candeeiros national parks was destroyed, and there were enormous material losses.</p>
<p class="contents">September has begun, and the scourge of the fires continues. Consequently, solidarity must be shown with the communities affected, urgent support must be provided for pastoralists and farmers who have lost their cattle-grazing land in, for example, the Serra de Soajo, and burnt wood must be removed immediately as fair payment for farmers, small forest owners and those sharing common land. It is vital, moreover, that we place the emphasis on prevention by means of increasing financial, technical and human resources, including support for those directly involved in fighting the fires and with the reforestation of burnt areas, namely the protected areas. Extraordinary aid must be granted to the worst affected areas and communities of Portugal from the European Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be no further delay in adopting effective public policies aimed at strengthening prevention, reforestation, and forestry development. The common agricultural policy must also be amended in order to ensure that family farming receives sufficient support for farmers to be guaranteed a decent living, by means of guaranteed production prices, and in order to stem the tide of people abandoning rural areas, which will be exacerbated by the decoupling of production aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again we see disastrous forest fires in the south. In large parts of Europe there have been great heat waves, with the highest temperatures recorded since records began, which led to great droughts.</p>
<p class="contents">In some regions in Poland the harvests fell by over twenty percent and hundreds of thousands of farming families found themselves in a desperate situation. Then heavy rainfall and localised flooding made harvesting difficult and compounded the losses. Government aid is limited and most farmers cannot afford the expensive insurance cover for their own farms. In any case, insurance does not solve the problem, as natural disasters are becoming the norm rather than the exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers in Poland and elsewhere are asking the European Union for aid, which currently is symbolic rather than real. It is imperative for us to create a European system which can be used to provide aid to the countries and people affected by natural disasters. It is vital to earmark larger funds than those we have at present, for this purpose. People whose houses have been destroyed by catastrophic fires, whose fields and crops have been destroyed by droughts or flooding, have to be able to count on solidarity and aid from the European Union. One of the reasons the European Union was created was so that its communities and citizens could help each other in times of need. The Union should show solidarity and provide aid for the victims of natural disasters such as droughts, floods or forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the European Commission to put forward real proposals both for a system to counteract the consequences of natural disasters and for providing aid for countries and people who have suffered as a result of such disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This disaster also affected my constituency of Lower Silesia. It is a problem which affects my country on an almost annual basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that droughts and fires affect mainly southern Europe and floods affect mainly northern Europe. It is also clear that we should, as the previous speakers have mentioned, make Solidarity Fund resources more flexible and define the bureaucracy to allocate these funds to the people and regions affected by disasters, and increase the funds earmarked for aid to these regions.

I do not think that is particularly useful to them.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is for us to debate the issue politically and for us to see what we can do as the European Union. I think that today's debate ultimately raises the question of what model of European Union we want. Do we want a European Union which only concerns itself with monetary policy, with competitiveness, with the internal market – matters which it quite rightly concerns itself with – or do we want a European Union which, at the same time, will be present at the major problems of daily life, present where there is human pain.</p>
<p class="contents">The fires we experienced this summer in my country, in Greece, are one such instance. Of course the Member States have the initiative in this sort of natural disaster, but that is no excuse for the European Union not to demonstrate its solidarity in a tangible manner, that is no excuse for the European Union to be absent.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything the Commissioner said about the initiatives taken this summer by the European Commission is particularly positive. An intervention by the Solidarity Fund would also be positive, but I think that the European Union needs to have more tools at its disposal. It needs a more substantial and more effective European civil protection mechanism, as called for by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in its motion.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got the Barnier report: the Council asked for it and the European Council welcomed it last June. Now we need to put the Barnier report into practice. We need to move at long last from theory to practice and I trust that the fact that the Council welcomed this report is not purely and simply an expression of diplomatic affability, but expresses the will of the European Union to be more present when such issues arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, eight other large-scale fires in other regions remain active.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy of the fires is still affecting a number of Member States this year, although it appears that Spain is currently the worst affected, with countless human tragedies, including loss of life, and economic and environmental losses that cannot be quantified. I therefore wish to express my solidarity and heartfelt sympathy with all Members of this House from all of the countries affected, and in particular those from Spain. I remind the House of those who have lost their lives in this inferno that has hit us, and pay tribute to all those who – in a professional capacity or otherwise – have striven as far as is humanly possible to mitigate the impact of the fires</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the problem of the forest fires and other disasters cannot be waved away overnight with a magic wand, particularly given that they are often down to a complex range of factors, such as the climate and negligence or crime on the part of human beings. Yet we also know that it is possible to reduce their scale and offset the impact if we attach due political priority to the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that Parliament recently dedicated a great deal of attention to the issue, over several months, and mobilised the resources and the good will to gain a better understanding of these phenomena, to identify the causes and to propose short-, medium- and long-term solutions to reverse this appalling situation. Various commissions interviewed researchers and experts, made contact with local authorities and communities, and formulated proposals and recommendations to the Commission and the Council that obtained broad political support in Parliament last May. I was the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which formulated some 30 proposals with a view to adopting a European strategy, which was aimed at achieving the objectives of reducing the impact of natural disasters to a minimum via the creation of new measures and ensuring that the various existing political and financial instruments operate coherently.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be unreasonable to expect all of these proposals to have been implemented since May, but there is an increasingly urgent need to move from the reports to practical action. The political debate is over, and there is awareness of and agreement on the political solutions needed. The fresh tragedy this summer has merely served to remind us that we need to act with increasing urgency so that next year we do not have to be restricted to expressing words of mutual solidarity in the face of a new tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my sincerest condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims and all of the people affected.</p>

Unlike the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, I do not believe that we can in any way criticise the management or response to the disaster on the part of the Galician authorities and the national government, but the fire was so big that it demonstrated the need for greater European solidarity and resources to help the Member States to put out large fires, or to deal with floods, as we are going to approve tomorrow in the case of funding for the fight against marine pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we must not fail to analyse the possible influence on these fires – the majority of which are believed to have been caused deliberately – of extensive planting of non-native species over previous decades, the confused changes of use or town-planning reclassifications of burnt areas, the paper pulp factories’ interest in obtaining cheap wood, or the alleged vengeance of former forest wardens who have not been employed for supervision purposes this summer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also analyse the extent to which all of us and the common agricultural policy are responsible for the forced abandonment of traditional agricultural activities by those people who, unable to find any alternative work, have left the rural areas and upset the land-planning balance, and therefore no longer look after the forests, or raise early alarms, or prevent arson attacks.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent years, Galicia has been particularly affected by disasters, such as the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. Furthermore, in recent years, 350 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed by fires, and this summer around 80 000.

Because the specific characteristics of this latest disaster suggest that these fires have been started deliberately by professionals. Who is behind this natural disaster?

The topics are fragmented, powers are fragmented and resources are fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">That alone would be enough to justify the tenacity with which my political group has been proposing for years to this House and the Commission that a European civil protection agency should be set up. This would be a versatile, flexible body endowed with its own powers and with human and material resources supplied by the Member States. It would be able not only to draw up a risk prediction and prevention plan, but also – and more importantly – to direct and coordinate emergency measures with all due speed in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now more important than ever to set up a civil protection agency, Commissioner, after the unfortunate experience of recent years when so-called Community cooperation has proved worthless and ineffective, if not downright harmful.</p>

Then let us put an end to the ambiguity of good intentions, Commissioner, and try to coordinate our interventions, powers and resources firmly and formally, so that Europe can also play a leading role when it is a case of protecting the right to life, which is a physiological right rather than an institutional one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Russia, more than a million hectares of forest burned, and the worst fires occurred close to the Finnish border. When the wind blew from the east, large clouds of smoke came across into Finland. They did not just cause a bad smell, but posed a very serious health risk. One estimate by the Finnish National Public Health Institute puts the health costs incurred at tens of millions of euros, and, indirectly and in the worst case scenario, this will also lead to the death of some Finnish citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia must comply with international agreements, and Parliament should call on the Commission to take action and negotiate with Russia to ensure that it too adheres to these agreements, provides its neighbouring countries with sufficient information, is prepared to accept help and also takes adequate action itself.

However, in certain countries, the inefficient way in which they were dealt with by the state mechanism was unprecedented. We must learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately in my country, Greece, preparations were for the first time in many years clearly inappropriate. Two areas of Greece, Halkidiki and Mani, suffered incalculable ecological and economic damage. It transpired that this happened in large part due to poor planning and coordination, resulting in approximately 50% of fire-fighting 'planes being immobilised.</p>
<p class="contents">All this would perhaps be a Greek family matter, if the forests lost did not constitute a loss not only for the natural wealth of Greece or Spain or France, but also for the wealth of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, what causes particular surprise is that the Greek Government did not request – I repeat did not request – assistance from the European Union Monitoring and Information Centre, unlike the Spanish Government, which requested and received civil protection aid on 9 August, including fire-fighting 'planes.</p>
<p class="contents">As many speakers rightly emphasised, Europe needs a common civil protection force straight away, as Parliament has repeatedly requested. What point is there in our endeavouring to create European civil protection mechanisms when some governments ignore them so flagrantly?</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the newly set up European Solidarity Fund must be ready to provide aid. I call from this tribune for the Commission to use the political considerations at its disposal to mobilise the necessary aid for the residents of the areas affected and for the Council to urgently align the rules for activating the Solidarity Fund with Parliament's proposals of 3 April 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2006, the European Commission presented its proposal for changing the existing Community civil protection mechanism. I had the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which we proposed – and I would emphasise this – that prevention should be included in funding. Today this does not exist, it is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission must exert its influence on the Member States, so that, at the very least, stricter legislation is introduced on changes of land use and reforestation after fires is mandatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recent years have been marked by numerous natural disasters such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, hailstorms and even blizzards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of and appreciate the efforts of MEPs and the entire European Parliament to establish a system for providing aid to those affected. It is unfortunate, however, that the European Commission has been rather slow in dealing with this matter. We often forget that the economic situation of those living in certain regions is affected not only by natural disasters but also the state of the economy and systems designed to foster regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">In Poland, which has been affected by nearly every type of natural disaster imaginable this year, we have had slower development, considerably lower levels of agricultural subsidies from the European Union, significantly lower production quotas and reference yields. To this list of disasters we can also add the Russian embargo on Polish plant and animal products, dumping on the fruit and vegetable markets and a lack of adequate protection for Polish producers.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to all this, the region around Lublin, which is one of the poorest regions in Poland and the European Union, has also recently experienced drought, hurricanes, hailstorms and flooding, which have caused serious damage to commercial buildings and housing. Entire homesteads have been destroyed or damaged and the hailstorms have almost entirely wiped out the already meagre harvest.</p>
<p class="contents">Polish farmers are weeping but nothing seems to be happening in the European Union. I think it is high time the European Commission drew up an effective means of combating the effects of natural disasters and providing aid to the people, families and regions affected by these disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, there are many things that disgust me. When will we stop having to talk, each September, about the forest fires that occurred over the summer? We have been doing this for years, and nothing has changed. Parliament has already adopted provisions instituting European coordination regarding civil protection. That shows real urgency. It is slowly coming into place, but it is quite clear that things need to improve.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disgusted because these disasters, although they are called natural, are not natural at all. These fires are deliberate, or due to negligence, and we must condemn that. The European Union cannot and must not act in the place of the Member States: they must do everything possible to avoid land speculation. They need political courage to implement real territorial planning policies that will conserve our natural spaces and the diversity necessary for the ecological balance of the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to emphasise prevention, in order to have less to repair. Europe’s role is to set common objectives for good forest management, with a certain degree of flexibility, because the Mediterranean forest is not the same as the Scandinavian forest and, if climate change makes one region drier, it will, unfortunately, cause floods elsewhere. It is our farmers who will suffer most, particularly in these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Europe must support the pro-active policies of the Member States and fund the action taken to reach the objectives. It must also encourage forest owners to diversify species, to provide firebreaks and to maintain the undergrowth, through programmes such as Forest Focus, Life+ and so on, but the most important thing is that we must not create an umpteenth European body. Public money is not intended to finance bureaucracy, but to respond effectively to the people’s expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fires in Galicia had to be extinguished under extreme conditions, conditions marked by the figure ‘30’: the temperature was above 30° for many days, there was a wind of more than 30 kilometres per hour and humidity was less than 30%. They were extinguished thanks to an unprecedented mobilisation, under the Presidency of the autonomous government, and national and international cooperation was a decisive factor. I would therefore like to express my gratitude for the support of the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still much work to be done and we must continue working together in three directions. In order to help those who have suffered damage, the Galician authorities have set an example by providing EUR 13 million for the most serious damage; the Spanish Government’s programme will provide between EUR 40 and 60 million. The European funds from the Solidarity Fund must be added, as Mrs Miguélez has pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Galician authorities have already launched a plan to the tune of EUR 126 million until 2009 for the restoration of the environment and also for progressing towards appropriate forestry development, and other Community funds must be opened up and mobilised for the same purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Fires are the main threat to European and Mediterranean forests and, as Galicians, we are very vulnerable. I would call upon the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to combat fires, to implement a Community programme for 2007-2013, to activate the Galileo system and the technological resources for the detection and fighting of fires, and to strengthen civil protection through the creation of a European civil protection force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a consequence of these droughts, we have also experienced huge fires or, in contrast, sudden and prolonged downpours that have caused equally sudden floods. All these phenomena are increasing in scale and causing a great deal of damage, particularly to the agricultural sector. It happened in 2005 in Spain and Portugal, and it happened this year in Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last two years, the European Parliament has adopted as many as three resolutions on the droughts in Portugal and Spain and on the effects of the natural disasters on the agricultural sector. Unfortunately, in spite of numerous debates in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted, the involvement of the European Institutions seems to have had no positive impact. Furthermore, the European Commission suggests that the funds for dealing with natural disasters should, first and foremost, come from the Member States. Be this as it may, the scale of the damage exceeds the financial resources of individual countries. There have also been suggestions that these kinds of events should be covered by insurance, and that insurance companies should pay for the damage. However, we should remember that natural disasters are becoming increasingly common and are so destructive that insurance companies are refusing to insure against these kinds of events.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to draw up a compensation system at European Union level which can be applied very quickly after damage is caused. The European Union should show solidarity in the face of ...</p>

The Disaster Relief Fund will be able to give help in Spain and Greece in particular, but also in other countries. That aid must be as unbureaucratic as possible. What these regions need is European solidarity, and we have the means to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, though, that Europe is not a suitable source of funds if fires are regularly started deliberately, and so, while I urge support for the victims, I also expect the Member States to call the arsonists to account and to punish them severely, particularly if their actions are motivated by land speculation, about which we hear every year with depressing regularity.</p>
<p class="contents">However the damage was done, we must help now, and the forces deployed to deal with disaster situations must be subject to binding rules on their coordination, at least in the states that want that.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether, however, Europe should apply its precious financial resources to rural development or even to cross-border cooperation in preventing and fighting forest fires, is another question; while I realise that a number of delegations are calling for this, I do not regard the prevention of forest fires and the creation of firebreaks as a specifically European task.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States affected want to use EU funds for that purpose, then they should be allowed to do so. Commissioner Dimas described the various options, including Life+, but please can these be kept within their national financial frameworks, and not take anything away from the protection of the environment in other countries? Moreover, they should be used only in response to current emergency situations, and not as functions of the future European structural and agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result has been a disaster. According to Commission sources in the middle of August – and I would be grateful if the Commissioner could give me a more up-to-date figure today – 88 473 hectares have been burnt, not including burnt areas of less than 50 hectares, of which there are many in Galicia, where farms are small, and the total burnt area is therefore well over 100 000 hectares, which is equivalent to 80% of the total area burnt in Spain and half of the entire area burnt in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Four fatalities, 514 injured, 35 villages evacuated, the main communication routes cut, many animals killed and seriously injured: in short, a real tragedy, an unprecedented environmental and human disaster, with immeasurable economic and social consequences. Unquestionably Galicia’s worst environmental disaster. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, which has been mentioned here, did not lead to any human victims and Galicia recovered quickly, as a result of the rapid action of marine regeneration, but this latest tragedy has left us with human victims and burnt areas that all the experts say will take 20, 30 or perhaps even more years to recover. How will it affect the climate, biodiversity, underground aquifers and the Natura 2000 areas that have been devastated?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what has failed this year in Galicia? Do you know? Do you believe that the fire can be said to have been tackled effectively in Galicia? You have told us here that the Spanish authorities asked for assistance and the European Union quickly responded. Could you tell us the date when it was requested, as others have asked? Could that cooperation have been improved?</p>
<p class="contents">Given the European dimension of this disaster, it falls to us in this Parliament to emphasise its magnitude and also to call for the resources necessary and assistance available to alleviate its dramatic short-, medium- and long-term consequences and to cooperate so that we can find out what has failed, in order to stop it happening again. To this end, we would ask for the urgent mobilisation of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund for Galicia, which has been devastated by fire and which is facing a very serious ecological, economic and social situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, by the end of August 59 000 hectares had been burnt, which is terrible, not least because protected areas have been burnt and there have been victims to mourn. It should also be acknowledged, however, that major efforts have been undertaken and enormous investment made in prevention and on-the-spot firefighting; a permanent monitoring system has been put in place involving the security forces, the armed forces and many young people; helicopter brigades have been set up to fight the fires during their first minutes; and there have been days on which more than 500 fires have been detected. There has been major investment in the training of firefighters and in the creation of professional forest firefighting teams, and I should like to pay tribute to their dedication and hard work.</p>

They have been especially devastating in Spain, particularly in Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">This year in Galicia, the fires exposed the inefficiency and lack of planning of the regional government. This very much exacerbated the consequences of the disaster: 4 fatalities, more than 500 wounded, more than 100 000 hectares burnt, 4% of Galicia’s wooded area burnt, serious environmental damage and, furthermore, serious repercussions for livestock farming, the tourism industry, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">This black August has also caused deep alarm throughout Galician society: Cerdedo, Soutomaior, Ponte Caldelas, Pontevedra, Meis, Santiago, Padrón, Muros, Vimianzo, Avión and Quiroga are some of the many municipalities affected by the fires in Galicia this summer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Galicians are a Europeanist people. They know that, as Goethe said, Europe was created on the road to Santiago de Compostela, and, as an Objective 1 region, Galicia is aware of the role that the Structural and Cohesion Funds have played in its development. I would also like to point out that, in Galicia, the number of ‘yes’ votes in last year’s referendum on the European Constitution was far higher than the average for the rest of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Galicia is now expecting the European Union’s Solidarity Fund to be mobilised, which, furthermore, will help to improve the Union’s image.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, more measures to prevent any repetition of this kind of disaster are needed. We must therefore make progress with the construction of a European civil protection system capable of responding quickly and effectively to the disasters that take place almost every summer and which affect the forests of southern Europe in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also pay more attention to the continent’s forest wealth in terms of preventing fires. In this regard, I am not sure whether the coming dismantling of the Forest Focus programme within the Life + programme is good news. Furthermore, as this Parliament has said on many occasions, we need a European directive in the field of forest fires and drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither Galicia, Spain nor Europe can resign themselves to the continued disappearance of our forests, as if that were their unavoidable fate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We note that the fires intensify every year, despite the fact that we have more and more aeroplanes available for putting them out. That is because we are changing – or rather we have changed – and we are downgrading the climate of the planet, thereby exacerbating the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, Greece, there was a truly huge disaster in Halkidiki and Mani.</p>
<p class="contents">In Halkidiki, one of the most beautiful – perhaps the most beautiful – and one of the most important tourist destinations in Greece, 60 000 decares were burned, causing huge damage both to the environment and to tourism and farming.</p>
<p class="contents">The victims need immediate compensation and the burnt areas need immediate – I repeat immediate – protection against the risk of the soil being washed away. Preventive measures for the future and a new fire policy need to be applied. We need to examine the possibility of replanting with trees that stop fires and which do not burn as easily as pine.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to examine again what sort of Europe we want. If we do not help our fellow sufferers now, then what sort of a Europe of solidarity are we talking about? If we are not generous to those who have been destroyed, then we should not be surprised if the people soon stop following us. If we do not stand by the people who have been destroyed, then we shall lose their trust and such a Europe certainly has no future.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to examine the issue beyond the question of the fires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In such a situation, one wonders what could have been done better beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, of course, I want to thank the emergency services, who did their utmost with promptness and speed, but I also want to thank the Greek Government for organising everything so very well, and with the help of the Greek Navy, for managing to save over a thousand lives.</p>
<p class="contents">What I regard as vital in a case such as this is an improvement in communications facilities. I can remember trying to dial 112 – the emergency number. When one is in a state of panic, numbers get confused, so it would certainly be a good idea to automate this to some extent. I also think it important that we in Europe should set up a civil protection force, the primary function of which would be to resolve the problems arising in disaster situations of this kind, and which would be able to try to get the situation under control as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a strategy for natural disasters is a core challenge. If there is to be cooperation not only between the armed forces, the rescue services, the fire brigade and the police, but also between all the bodies with responsibility in such situations, they need a suitable communications platform in order to be able to help each other rapidly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else of importance would be a European observatory to make information available. I had to telephone, from Greece, the APA press service in Austria in order to find out the actual extent of the disaster. It was very interesting to see that the Austrian office very quickly got in touch with the Greeks, and it was this that enabled the Navy to save many people’s lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A very wide and rich range of issues was raised, from trans-boundary pollution – fires in Russia, which should of course be raised in the framework of EU-Russia cooperation – to stricter criminal laws regarding arson and arsonists, which lie within the exclusive competence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union mechanism for civil protection is a relatively new instrument with limited resources, limited means and competences, but recent experience shows that it works: it is a real example of European Union added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, when dealing with natural disasters there is no room for complacency and it is clear that our prevention, preparedness and response activities can still be improved. This is why earlier this year the Commission prepared a legislative proposal to reinforce the mechanism both politically and operationally. For example, the proposal will allow for the mobilisation of extra transport equipment and will provide a platform upon which to contribute to the development of early warning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 2005, the Commission also presented a proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies. One part of this proposal provides the legal framework for the future financing of civil protection operations and will result in a budget of EUR 119 million over a seven-year period. This is an improvement on previous levels of funding but, as I have mentioned many times before, the Commission can only respond to the ambitious requests made by other institutions if sufficient resources are made available. Mrs Estrela, we have an ancient proverb, δεί δή χρημάτων – money is needed. Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!</p>
<p class="contents">Both these instruments are currently being negotiated by the Council. The Commission would like to have them adopted by the end of the year once Parliament’s opinion is available. I would also like to offer specific thanks for Parliament’s initiative to earmark an additional EUR 6.5 million in the civil protection budget for 2006. This has allowed the Commission to launch an initiative to design, develop and test European approaches to joint civil protection intervention. This cooperation and coordination will make our fight against natural disasters – such as the floods in several European countries, or the summer forest fires in Spain, for which assistance was requested by the Spanish authorities on 9 August – even more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific question of forest fires, which was raised by a number of Members, it is necessary to note as I have before that forestry matters are a Member State competence. Member States are responsible for launching actions to protect forests threatened by fire, as well as restoration efforts. The main aim of the measures we take at European Union level is to reinforce the Member States’ policies.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures include the possibility of financial support available under the new Rural Development Regulation, the Forest Focus Regulation and, from 2007, the Commission’s proposal for LIFE Plus, which explicitly provides for the possibility of financing forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention activities in order to continue the work of the Forest Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look towards the future. The Commission is preparing a study to look at the effectiveness of Community measures for forest protection and at options to improve the effectiveness of these measures. The results of these analyses are expected by the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a directive under the codecision procedure on the assessment and management of floods, which I hope will be adopted soon. The Commission has also undertaken preparatory work with regard to the threat of droughts, which become more intensive and frequent each year, particularly, but not only, in the southern parts of Europe. We are engaged in discussions with the Member States to collect information and to assess whether similar legislative action is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite a few speakers referred to the Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, which does not allow the Commission to mobilise the fund on its own initiative. It is necessary for the Member State concerned to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage. To date, no such application has been received from the Spanish Government. The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the regulation for mobilising the fund are met. The rules governing this instrument allow for the possibility of assistance in the event of major natural disasters. To qualify for aid, the estimated cost of total direct damage must exceed EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices, or 0.6% of gross national income of the state in question, whichever is lower. The Solidarity Fund is not designed to support general longer-term prevention measures for the rehabilitation of agricultural production potential. In such cases, other potential sources of funding exist at Community level, including projects co-financed by the structural funds. In addition, several possibilities of response to national disaster exist within the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2006, the Commission’s civil protection mechanism responded to floods, earthquakes, forest fires, marine pollution and emergencies with a humanitarian dimension. Four European countries requested assistance in the spring floods, even though a greater number were eventually affected. We sent experts to all sorts of situations, from coordinating the European effort in Cyprus and Lebanon to assisting the Indonesian authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake and the eruption of a volcano. We sent emergency supplies such as medicines, medical supplies, food and shelter. We dispatched equipment to pump water and to extinguish fires. With your support we shall continue to better prepare ourselves and to improve our response for the benefit of the Member States and those we seek to help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
