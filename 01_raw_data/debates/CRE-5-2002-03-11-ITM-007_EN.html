<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">– (DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yet again – but not at quite as late an hour as otherwise in Parliament – we are able to debate the further development of postal services in the European Union. In recent years – one might almost say decades, when I think back to when the Commission presented the first Green Paper on the further development of postal services – we have in fact managed, step by step, to open up the European Union's markets in postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">The path we took together in the past was a good one for the public as users of postal services, but also for the service providers, who were enabled to develop themselves as competitive enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here today to debate, and come to a decision about, the Council's Common Position of last October. At First Reading, we very intensively grappled with the Commission proposal on the development of postal services, and were able to convince the Council of the rightness of our arguments on many points. I would just like to point out that the deletion of the definition of special services, including express services, was Parliament's idea and was taken over by the Council, and that the retention of price and weight limits for outgoing mail in the Council text was something Parliament had demanded, and thus a great success for us. I would also like to enter on Parliament's credit side the fact that we were able essentially to get our way on special tariffs, cross-subsidies and the further timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest controversy in recent weeks and months has, of course, been about the weight and price limits. I think that the Council has found a fair compromise between the Commission proposal and the outcome of First Reading in Parliament. The Commission had proposed 50 grammes, Parliament 150 grammes, and the Council decided in favour of the mean value, that is, 100 grammes. I think that is a fair compromise towards further opening up postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee, we very intensively grappled with the Council Common Position. I think, across all group lines, we achieved a good result, which amounts to this: Further liberalisation of the post will not be delayed. I hope that my proposal, as adopted in committee, will be confirmed by the plenary on Wednesday, and, as things stand, there is no conciliation procedure, which means the markets have a clear road ahead, as do the national legislatures to transpose the European norms.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish at this juncture to express my gratitude to the Belgian Presidency of the Council, under whose aegis this compromise has been achieved; to the Spanish Presidency of the Council, which has worked very constructively with me in order to reach a solution which obviates the need for a conciliation procedure, and of course, to the Commission and to you, Commissioner Bolkestein. I think that the achievement of our very intensive discussions over recent weeks and months has been that the Commission has guided onto a sensible track Parliament's justified concerns and the political possibilities in the Council. I think it makes sense for us, as with telecommunications, to be informed on a two-yearly basis how the postal sector as a whole appears to be developing.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a matter of great concern to my fellow Members, and I, as rapporteur, am very glad to take it up, that we should closely follow what happens in this sector, which is of course an important part of all our lives, for everyone is happy if, as is to be hoped, he gets agreeable post and not just bills.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the maintenance of postal services should be safeguarded throughout the European Union, in remote and rural areas, rather than just taking the pickings of an interesting market, so that all citizens may have full access in the long term to postal services. We must constantly remind ourselves of this, to which we want to commit the Commission, by obliging them to submit to us a report on the subject every other year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also attach great importance to our desire to be involved when the post is developed further. The Commission will be carrying out a study in 2006. That is going to be stated in the directive, and our concern is that we be involved in the run-up to it, when the issues and topics to be considered and studied are to be worked out. For that, too, many thanks to the Commission, for its readiness to go down this road together with Parliament. I think we are on the right road, and I hope that, at the end of this decade, the postal services will have achieved their objective of being competitive enterprises providing their services for the benefit of Europe's citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thanks to Mr Ferber's hard work, we have what I think is a first class result with what appeared to be an exceptionally tricky issue. When the debate started and during the first reading, we all saw huge problems in store, with major differences between the various political persuasions in the House. The vote, in committee at least a few days ago, demonstrated that a large majority in the European Parliament agreed with the positions put forward just now by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were looking to do was to reconcile two needs: first, the need to safeguard the universal service, a universal service in island regions, in mountain regions and in remote regions of the European Union and, secondly, the need for a free, competitive market, the need to guarantee a single market in this sector by widening consumer choice. And I think that, in the end, we managed to find a creative way of reconciling these two needs. So we have a good result, both for those worried about losing the universal service and for those who wanted to advance the single market and widen consumer choices. And of course, in doing so, we have carried out the instructions of earlier European Councils, such as the Lisbon Council, which talked of the need to push ahead and extend the market in the postal services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the three amendments proposed by our committee improve things still further and are, I believe, acceptable both to the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for all his work and, indeed, thank the Commissioner for his work. Some of you might find that a little surprising, as it is well known that Commissioner Bolkestein and I have not seen eye to eye on this matter all of the time. However, what we have from the Council is the result of some good work all round.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight what we as a Parliament asked for in the first reading and what we actually got. We asked for controlled and gradual liberalisation. Did the Council agree with that? Yes, they did. We asked for codecision for the European Parliament for any future steps to full liberalisation. Did we get that? Yes, we did. We asked for special services to be taken out of the directive. Did they agree with that? Yes, they did. We also asked for the universal service to be guaranteed. Did they give us that? Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="contents">The one thing they did not give us was the starting point of 150 grammes for that controlled and gradual liberalisation. As the rapporteur said, they came up with a compromise of 100 and then 50 grammes. That is not bad going for a European Parliament to put five demands to the Council, get four of them in full and half of the other. Therefore, I would like to make those people who wish to stick to the 150 gramme level aware of what their actions will lead to should they pursue that particular policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we go for 150 grammes it will lead to a failure of the agreement. The Council common position will unravel, and collapse. All our gains, including codecision on future moves will be lost and the Commission will then move in under Article 80 – as I am sure they are keen to do – and give us full liberalisation sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">If ever there was a classic case of cutting off your nose to spite your face, it is that of those people advocating 150 grammes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, through this Chamber I wish to make a plea to Postcomm, the British postal regulator. You now have an opportunity, through this directive, to end your self-declared war on the British Post Office and the British people. We have all been impressed by your macho image, clearly learned from watching too many World Wrestling Federation bouts. But Europe has showed you how to maintain a viable post office offering a universal service of excellent quality at an affordable price. So for God's sake, Postcomm, get off the battlements and see sense! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am proud that someone from my group, Rik Daems, thanks to his negotiating skills, managed to get this common position on paper at the time, which was certainly not an easy task. It is a very even-handed position, in my view. Mr Simpson too has already referred to it. There may still be other people out there who believe that the postal services should remain a national government monopoly. I am not one of them. There may be people who believe that public services should not be a topic of discussion. I am certainly not one of them either. The common position is somewhere in between. It takes account of the wishes of the customers, the people who use the postal services, which is what should be our priority, in my view. We must ensure that postal companies are able and obliged to carry out this task. We have received agreement from fifteen Member States and fifteen postal services. This is very important. This means that we will be able to modernise services of this kind very rapidly, and that we can ensure that they become first-rate businesses, if they are not so already. There are also people who want to go faster or slower than the common position, or those who want more grammes, etc. This is not wise, in my view. As Mr Simpson said before: if we now loosen the string, the entire package will unravel and collapse, which would be a bad outcome. We must prevent this happening at all costs. Our group will therefore adopt the three amendments tabled by the rapporteur, but not the others.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that is now before us provides postal companies with the opportunity to become modern businesses within a realistic timeframe, by no later than 2009, with a clearly defined set of tasks and with transparent accounts, businesses that put the interests of their customers before their own and fulfil a social function at the same time. This role is, I believe, crucial in sparsely populated and remote areas and helps the weaker in our society. We also provide a directive in which each Member State and each postal service can acquit itself of this task. In my opinion, if we follow the rapporteur and if we manage – as I believe we shall – to obtain the endorsement of the Council and the Commission, we will have created something which is very valuable and in which we can take pride. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? Because we all know the social role fulfilled by the postal service in poorer urban areas and in rural or outlying areas. And we know, we all understand perfectly well – a six year-old child could work this out – that reducing the scope of reserved services undermines the ability of operators to make financial adjustments, which are the basis of solidarity. This solidarity also enables the necessary modernisation to be undertaken so that high quality services can be provided for all. Will we soon be telling taxpayers that they will have to put money in the kitty to finance universal service, as they do in the Netherlands? After this vote, are we going to show our support for post office closures or our support for the postal workers who are going to be laid off? Are we going to take part in these demonstrations after voting on this position? Certainly not. We cannot accept a common position today that is still too similar to the position adopted at first reading. There is nothing new in the debate. I have not heard anyone say that the price of a stamp has gone down in Sweden. I have not heard anyone say that there has been compensation for the jobs that have been lost at traditional operators. I have not heard anyone say that the new operators are considering introducing a single price for the European postage stamp. There is absolutely nothing new here. We are still waiting for the Commission to provide the evaluations that were planned in 1997 and that have been called for in two resolutions adopted by Parliament and in the report by Mr Ferber.</p>

<p class="contents">I would reiterate that the Commission proposed, in particular, to reduce the weight and price limits, from 350g to 50g and from five to two and a half times the basic standard tariff, to establish special services with high added value which would be open to competition, the gradual liberalisation of outgoing cross-border mail and direct mail, and to set specific deadlines for full liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, a large majority of the European Parliament refused to fully support the Commission. Parliament proposed that reductions in the weight and price limits should not go below 150g and four times the basic standard tariff; it rejected liberalisation of cross-border mail and direct mail; it dismissed special services, put back the final deadline for liberalisation and lastly, requested a comprehensive impact study.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Council of Ministers – regardless of what a number of Members are saying – differs considerably from the compromise reached by a majority in the European Parliament. Although the compromise also abandons the idea of creating special services – a move I welcome – it takes up the Commission’s original proposals on reducing the thresholds and, despite the fact that numbers evened out with the announcement of the deadline, I feel that the compromise will put full liberalisation of the sector at risk. It is therefore hard for me to understand why what we saw in a negative light yesterday is now something we regard positively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission have not taken Parliament’s opinion into account. They are introducing a significant new stage into the liberalisation of the postal sector. Mr Ferber’s report – whose work I would also like to commend – as adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, falls in line with the Council’s position, although, admittedly, several amendments have been added, which I believe to be quite inadequate and which will certainly not require conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">As expressed in the minority opinion of Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities in the parliamentary committee, no guarantees have been given on social and economic consequences or on social cohesion. Contrary to the spirit and the text of the Langen report, no serious, transparent and pluralist preliminary study has been undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Important issues such as conditions of access to networks of new operators or conditions for the financing of universal service remain ill defined. I must say that these proposals cause me, as they do my fellow Member, Mrs Flautre, a great deal of concern as to the effects they might have on working conditions, jobs and the quality of services provided with equal access for all, in other words, on the very future of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will therefore demand that the Council’s common position be rejected by a roll-call vote and, furthermore, will propose introducing a specific amendment for a study to be undertaken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As reiterated in a petition signed by French postal workers, we would like to point out that, the monopoly on the postal system in France has enabled us to build up a high quality public service that is valued by all. A comprehensive service is provided throughout France with 90 000 postmen and 17 000 post offices, whilst prices are some of the lowest available, thanks to tariff equalisation. In all European countries, the public postal service is experiencing the same effects as a result of liberalisation. As regards closures, for instance, 400 post offices closed last year in Belgium, half of the 1 600 post offices in the Netherlands closed down, 30 000 jobs were lost in England, tariffs were increased for people in Sweden. In France, the effects of liberalisation will also be felt, the quality of service is falling and workers who have left are not being replaced. Several post offices were closed last summer; 4 000 workers on private-law contracts working for the postal service had inferior conditions of employment compared to existing permanent members of staff. In 2002, 12 800 employees are due to retire, approximately 2 000 workers need to be recruited, which equates to 10 000 job cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">This ideological aim corresponds to a short-term economic interpretation of the internal market. There are numerous examples of the failings of alternative systems such as deteriorating quality, an increase in tariffs, even that the service can no longer be provided. The harmful effect on users is therefore more serious than what you could envisage happening in State monopolies. We refuse to allow a model of social and territorial cohesion based on equal citizenship to disappear, even if the situation still has some way to go before it is perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">We refuse to sacrifice a quality service simply in order to open up markets to capitalists, especially since we do not know whether or not they will be European. We must take urgent action, and I am pleased to hear that some Members are prepared to ignore instructions from above and even that these instructions are becoming increasingly vague.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must therefore vote to reject this common position, which means, for some of us, having the courage to meet our commitments and for others to respect the diversity and a model that we want to maintain on the basis of satisfactory experience.</p>
<p class="contents">As two final points, I must remind those who claim and who fear that, if the common position is rejected, the Commission will use Article 86, which bizarrely enables civil servants to pass legislation directly. Having failed itself, is the Commission in a position to point the finger at others’ faults? Despite renewed promises, the impact studies are unofficial, biased and incomplete. Even the Court of Justice could find fault with them. And if it risked using Article 86 anyhow, the Convention would have to redefine Europe’s objectives with full background knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With this situation in mind, we ask you to reject the draft directive, which would speed up the deterioration of public service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the common position reached by the Council on 15 October 2001 on the opening to competition of Community postal services, is a good compromise, so we are told by the rapporteur and the governments. This includes the French socialist government, which urges us all to approve it. We, however, think that this text has been based on a series of ambiguities which may be masking many dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the French Secretary of State responsible for this matter, Mr Piret, claims that less than 10% of the postal service’s turnover will be open to competition by 2009, whereas Commissioner Bolkestein estimates that 50% of the European market will be open to competition by 2006. Who is correct? Of course, Mr Piret is talking about France and Mr Bolkestein about the European Union, but even so, the huge difference between the two figures leads us to believe that there is a misunderstanding somewhere or that we are being kept in the dark.</p>
<p class="contents">The second ambiguity is we are told that the new directive will enable the market to be opened in a gradual and controlled fashion. However, if we look closely at the proposed arrangements, we might have some doubts over the quality of this control. The intermediate stage, which is 1 January 2006, when the weight of mail still not open to competition will be brought down from 100g to 50g, or halved, will be an automatic stage that has already been decided in the document before us. This will happen even though a comprehensive or appropriate impact study has not been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, there is a risk that the prospective impact study, which is due to start in 2006, will conclude that the essential decisions have already been taken, that they are already behind us and, once again, we will have taken an unsteady step forward without knowing exactly when and how we have passed the major milestones. This will almost be a further example of the Monnet method, but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we are in favour of opening the market to competition, provided this would enable us to refine the postal services, but we do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. We do not want to take the risk of a poorly controlled opening of the market destroying the universal service, which would spell further disaster for the user, especially in a country such as France, where extensive rural areas could see their postal service deteriorate. That is why we believe that the 2006 stage must not be automatic, but that a comprehensive and thorough impact study must be carried out beforehand. We also require clarification of the public service obligations to impose on all operators. And, even better, we hope that it is acknowledged, Mr President, that all public services are the overall responsibility of each Member State and that these will have a free hand in the ultimate organisation of their postal service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all remember, we started off from positions very far apart, opposing positions in some cases, and we – Parliament, Council and Commission – succeeded in reaching a compromise which we feel will be genuinely capable of catering for even the most radical demands, which some of the Members have upheld this evening, while satisfying a further, absolutely imperative demand which we endorse and support, namely the need to liberalise the public services in the interests of the citizens and consumers, and this is not a whim or part of a general liberalisation trend.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of liberalisation is to improve the quality of the services provided to the consumer, the user. Clearly, there are some services which require particular attention and this is one of them. We have been very careful with this sector: we have introduced more stages, more steps into the process and have achieved a genuinely satisfactory result. We are convinced, it is our hope, that this text – which we hope will not need any form of conciliation – will become a clear, unambiguous legislative point of reference. There are no grey areas and, even if the letter were to prove at all ambiguous, the substance is clear, Commissioner, and we call upon and expect the Commission to abide by the text in its work. We likewise call upon the other Directorates-General and your other colleagues to follow the line taken by the text, particularly the members of the Directorate-General for Competition, who will deal with disputes that are still pending and some of the problems left over from the past in the light of this development, in the light of what we decide today. Henceforth, the path we must take is clear: we expect you all to follow it with due care and commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coming as I do from a country with a great many small islands and numerous mountain areas in the hinterland, I have every right and am justified, I think, in being anxious about the repercussions opening up this market will have on the quality of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this anxiety should have been allayed, we feel, by optimistic results from the study ordered by the Commission. Are there in fact any such optimistic results for the ‘difficult countries’, including my own? In the end, instead of the required ex ante examination of the situation, we now have an ex post evaluation once the first steps have been taken, but at least that will allow us to determine what steps to take next.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must pay close attention to and take particular care with this process which, at this stage at least, has to be dealt with as a mandatory process under Article 80 of the Treaty. To ensure we do not contradict ourselves, we must bear in mind that Directive 96/67, which is currently being amended, guarantees European citizens and companies a quality universal postal service without discrimination, at both national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not make sense to move heaven and earth so that our cohesion policy can continue to be efficient while, at the same time, jeopardising the future of a village post office which is the village's lifeline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many strive towards freer market conditions, while others were very apprehensive about the disintegration of the social dimension offered by the postal services. This contrast was so marked that it proved impossible to strike a compromise that was acceptable to both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Like other services, postal services came into being in order to meet a social need. Under the influence of all kinds of developments, especially of a technological nature, these needs have changed. The advent of new communication services constituted keen competition for the traditional postal companies. The effects of these developments are felt in both companies as a whole and among their staff. I believe that, with a healthy dose of business acumen, the companies are capable of absorbing these blows. The mechanisation and automation of post-handling services are a case in point. Things are not so easy for the staff of postal companies. Nobody can deny that both developments – competition and technological changes – adversely affect employment. We have to acknowledge this. However, always mindful of what really matters, we do believe that society-oriented services do pay off.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the social dimension is useful as a guide for continuing to provide market-oriented services, even in areas where it is less evident. However, we should remain aware of the fact that the responsibility for this and for the conditions under which this is done lies with the Member States. This is positive. After all, the situation is quite different in the different Member States. In order to guarantee adequate services for each Member State and region, it is useful for Member States to apply a licensing system with the option of using performance criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Time will tell whether the present common position can guarantee an adequate level of services across the regions. A thorough, broad-based assessment will need to provide the decisive answer. Based on that assessment, this discussion will need to be followed up at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I am of the view that the present common position, including the amendment by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, can be considered an even-handed position on the market development of the postal services. Our delegation will support it accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The postal system is a service of general interest as well as an economic activity. The performance of the postal services contributes to the performance of the national economies and certain sectors, particularly banking, insurance or distance selling. At a time when we are setting up, in tandem with the single currency, the internal market of financial services, where we are trying to provide a favourable framework for <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce in Europe, we cannot ignore the demands from these sectors to improve services and reduce the costs of postal services. A certain degree of competition, along with increased demands for quality services, encourages transparency of costs and contributes to the competitiveness of consumer or user activities of the postal services by giving them potential openings. I am, however, firmly against all types of full liberalisation, as the services of general economic interest play a role in the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union. The European Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledges the principle of access to the service of general economic interest as laid down in national legislation and practices. The importance of access to postal services is not the same in a country with 17 000 post offices and in a country that has barely one thousand. We must therefore guarantee that the opening up to competition will not have any negative consequences on the access to postal services in the most isolated or most remote regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I think that the modernisation of the postal services under the guise of competition is now required in order to develop these services and, more broadly speaking, for the competitiveness of our businesses. This liberalisation must, however, be gradual and controlled in order to preserve adaptability, economic viability and guaranteed access to the universal postal service throughout the Union’s territory. I think that the compromise before us brings together both these aims and that is why I will vote in favour of it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, however, note that two things are lacking today and we are dealing with one of those rare liberalisation directives which makes no specific mention of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing is the financing of universal service. As soon as exclusive rights and the reserved sector are opened up and inevitably become smaller, we no longer know how universal postal service will be financed. And this is no small matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the conditions of network access. Do we know whether the networks of the French postal system are available to the German postal system and its major competitors and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>? This is also one of those rare liberalisation directives which fails to specify this aspect in a detailed manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my regret that the Commission and also Parliament did not want to thoroughly debate these issues. The Commission says it wants transparency across the board and yet, it is refusing to undertake an evaluation of what has been happening, particularly in Sweden and in Holland, where a scaled-down market has registered an increase in prices for the ordinary consumer. The Commission refuses to accept the truth about these costs and the truth is that providing a service to everyone in Greece is not the same thing as providing a service in the Netherlands. In short, they have demonised the debate and pretended that conciliation is a bad thing. I think that we could have seen this debate through to the end in order to achieve a more balanced position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not feel that this is a negative compromise, which, as such, would not content anybody, but a positive compromise, particularly in terms of the guarantees that it succeeds in providing: guarantees that liberalisation will be carried out gradually and in a responsible manner, without sacrificing the need for universal services in any way; clear guidelines for the processes of reorganising production and services too, aimed particularly at guaranteeing consumers high quality services at increasingly lower yet still competitive costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I do feel, however, that the difficulty will now be preventing the Commission distorting the meaning of the text when it interprets and applies it, thus upsetting the balance reached and, worst of all, violating Parliament’s decision-making rights. This will be a particular problem when it comes to Community competition rules and the Commission departments which ensure that these rules are adhered to. The infringement procedures instigated against the Italian State and the Belgian postal service appear to disregard not just the precedence taken by special legislation over general legislation but also the base regulation, that this directive makes more explicit, banning the indiscriminate liberalisation of what are known as special or value added services, to which the specific price and weight limits introduced in the directive apply without variation. This also concerns the Commission’s attitude to terminal dues, as referred to in<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>Reims II agreement<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would also appear that the Commission is rather behind schedule in proposing to regulate access, pursuant to Article 11 of the old directive, and this delay must be made good without upsetting the balances achieved between operators on the basis of mutual commitments so that private individuals can enjoy the benefits without having to bear the burdens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first round, the Commission did not, I think, comply with this request which had been addressed by Parliament, and the Common Position with the Council is, I think, a good compromise, which does justice to both the public interest and also to the interests of the people and employees it affects.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the scepticism that has been expressed, we also need to articulate clearly what we are voting on this week. It is only from 2006 onwards that things will get exciting. We then want the Commission to inform us how the universal service is to be financed. There is no blank cheque; instead we are getting a study. There is no automatic behaviour here; instead we want to know in the most exact terms – for that is the crucial thing – whether, as for example Mr Mastorakis put it, people in rural areas on islands are to continue to get a good postal service. That will be the case only in 2006. I thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, as I think he has brought the various Parliamentary interests and the Council together, so that this week, I believe, we can manage to get a good majority for a good compromise.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Torres Marques (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament’s position at first reading of the draft directive on the opening of postal services to competition was decisive. In fact, the Council accepted four out of the five basic principles we put forward. Our only demand not to be accepted was that of bringing down the weight limit of normal post from 150 grammes to 100 grammes. We should not forget, however, that the weight limit proposed by the Commission was 50 grammes.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the most important aspect of this discussion? To my mind, it is to maintain the security of postal services as universal services, which all Europeans citizens have the right to use, regardless of where they live. It is also essential that the postal services continue to fulfil the irreplaceable social role that they have traditionally played, whilst being able to remain competitive and to provide increasingly up-to-date services. What is the issue here? The issue is that by the end of this year, it will be possible to end the monopoly of postal services that has hitherto been allowed to exist, and unless we are able to reach a common position between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, in 2003 the Commission, using a different legal basis, will be able to treat this problem as a case of competition within the internal market, which falls within the competence of the Commission alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are now discussing is, then, under the current circumstances, the safest one. Not only is the common position reasonable and accepted by the companies responsible for postal services in our countries, but it also makes any new liberalisation dependent on co-decision by the Council and Parliament. We suggest that we vote in favour of the Ferber report with the amendments that we adopted in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this subject has been debated in many places over many years and is of great importance, and I therefore welcome the fact that many speakers have given their opinion on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that I do not need to re-emphasise the importance of postal services for the European economy and its citizens. I would like, however, to reaffirm the need to make progress with the social reform that has been initiated and to move forward towards the accomplishment of the internal market for postal services. In this context, I am happy that the in-depth debates held in the European Parliament and the Council are about to bring appropriate solutions to the key challenges which have been widely discussed. I am grateful to the institutions of the European Union for together planning a road map for supporting the ongoing modernisation of the postal sector whilst maintaining the asset of the universal postal service. May I, in particular, praise the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Simpson, whom I thank in particular for the kind words which he addressed to me. I should like to thank both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur for their support and their constructive attitudes which have greatly contributed to making all this possible. Steering such a difficult dossier was a challenge which they have successfully met thanks to the support of their colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position reached in Council sets out a clear path for a gradual and controlled implementation of the internal market for postal services. It provides for sufficient time for all the market players to be prepared, and for guaranteeing that the universal service is maintained. The Belgian Presidency – Mr Sterckx referred to the presidency of the country of which he is a citizen- the Belgian presidency has found a good compromise which successfully meets a triple challenge: firstly, to reconcile divided Member States around a common approach; secondly, to largely reflect the European Parliament's position from the first reading – Mr Simpson enumerated the five points of which he said four-and-a-half were achieved by Parliament; and thirdly to gain wide endorsement from the industry stakeholders, including unanimous support from the 15 incumbent postal operators.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may say so, Mr President, the European Parliament can indeed be proud of its significant impact on the common position. Let me mention four points. Firstly, the definition of special services was deleted, as mentioned by Mr Simpson. Secondly, the timetable and weight limits were significantly modified to meet the demand for a more gradual and controlled approach. Thirdly, derogations will be possible concerning liberalisation of outgoing cross-border correspondence to the extent necessary to ensure the provision of the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Parliament will be involved before any subsequent decisive step, confirming, if appropriate, the full accomplishment of the internal market in the year 2009, or determining any other step in the light of the results of a dedicated study. It would therefore seem that Parliament has significantly influenced the common position, and congratulations on that accomplishment are due.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur have managed to maintain this widely supported compromise. They have succeeded in strengthening the common position by updating its monitoring and controlling provisions in order to ensure that the stakeholders will be kept properly informed and fully involved during the process. The Commission supports the demand from a majority of Members of this Parliament for regular reports on the application of this directive. I certainly appreciate their wish to be kept informed of developments. A similar process has proved to be successful in other sectors, such as telecoms and transport, as Mr Sterckx pointed out. This demand from Parliament is not only legitimate but also beneficial, since it ensures that the next codecision procedure can be as successful as this one in gathering wide support among the stakeholders for such an important Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also appreciates Parliament's improvements to the accuracy of the common position drafting. In this spirit the Commission can accept, and I can personally support, all the compromise amendments worked out during this second reading to further strengthen the common position. This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and in the same spirit – it will be no surprise that the Commission is not able to support other amendments which diverge from the largely supported approach of the common position. This concerns the remaining proposed amendments to that common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the proposed legislative resolution "asking the Commission to involve all the relevant actors in the sector as well as the European Parliament and Council as closely as possible in the preparation, implementation and follow-up of the prospective study", I have already covered that point. I should like to state again my best intention to meet this wish of the European Parliament when the time comes, using the most appropriate means and in full respect of the applicable agreements between the Commission and Parliament on follow-up procedures for European Parliament resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like again sincerely to thank this Parliament for its attitude on this report. The expected result, thanks to the contribution of all who have been involved in its preparation, is good for the postal market as a whole and will, I trust, give a lift to the Barcelona Summit which is to take place in a few days time when it reviews progress on our ambition to become the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world by the year 2010. This report demonstrates in a clear and practical way that European institutions can transform their commitments into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
