<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Torres Marques (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it has not been possible since 1992 to achieve greater harmonisation of value added tax, the Commission quite rightly decided to go for a different solution, which is to harmonise and simplify VAT administrative practices, as a result of the work carried out by the SLIM (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) Group. The difficulty of this proposal is finding a situation of optimal balance which makes the work of companies easier, particularly SMEs, although the directive is aimed at all business in the European Union, and yet does not lead to a loss of income or make it more difficult for tax administrations to carry out audits. We would do well to bear in mind that income from VAT is not only a very important source of income for national budgets, it is also one of the own resources for funding the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore propose that we basically approve the Commission’s proposal, as long as it meets three important political objectives. First of all, the proposed harmonisation of compulsory statements in invoices would entail a considerable lightening of the administrative burden for traders operating across the European Union. Currently, traders are faced with fifteen different sets of regulations and, in total, with twenty-five different compulsory statements. We must, therefore, welcome the proposal to replace this patchwork of rules with a single list of compulsory statements, which will mean, in practice, that a trader would have to comply with only one set of rules for all invoices issued to customers in the EU. Secondly, the introduction of a common framework for electronic invoicing will further lighten the administrative burden for companies, while at the same time making VAT audits more efficient. In addition, electronic invoicing will result in savings for companies as the cost of sending and handling an electronic invoice is far lower than a paper invoice. Thirdly, the introduction of a common set of rules for E-invoicing will also further the development of electronic commerce in Europe, not least as regards services provided by electronic means.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the amendments we tabled in committee, my colleagues and I, have improved the draft directive. Nevertheless, there are two aspects resulting from the vote taken in committee, with which I do not agree. One aspect concerns an amendment tabled by my colleague, José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil on the numbering of invoices. The Commission is proposing a single number and I propose that this number should be sequential, in one or more series. In other words, we can adopt different series, according to the country or type of product, but always on a sequential basis. I feel that this must have been Mr García-Margallo y Marfil’s intention, but the version that has been adopted says exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">The other aspect concerns electronic signatures. I agree with the Commission’s proposal that the authenticity of the origin and integrity of the contents of invoices must be guaranteed by means of an advanced electronic signature within the meaning of the European Parliament and Council directive on a Community legal framework for electronic signatures. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted against this proposal, or rather, tabled an amendment to remove this proposal. I think that we should reintroduce this proposal, or in other words, that we should keep the Commission’s wording. Why do I say this? While it is true that electronic signatures come at a cost, this is relatively insignificant compared to the potential savings. The level of security chosen by the Commission can currently be bought on the Belgian market for around EUR 15 per year. This cost is expected to fall in the near future, in particular once the European Directive enters into force. Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive to ensure that use is made of this simplified electronic signature. We now have the opportunity to use this directive and to provide guarantees for tax administrations. I think that this principle, proposed by the Commission, should be maintained. What I mean is that this is a good proposal and that Parliament’s amendments are all – with the exception of these two examples – a step in the right direction. This proposal will make the life of businesses and tax administrations easier through this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would highlight that the Commission’s proposal seems to me to be a good one. My good friend Mrs Torres Marques has stressed this effectively. I believe that it fulfils four of the fundamental objectives relating to simplifying administrative obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">As she has said, the harmonisation of the requirements for information to appear on the invoice will mean that traders operating within the single market will be subject to a single legislation, while until now they have had to know, comply with and apply fifteen different legislations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and the rapporteur has also highlighted this – this simplification will also mean significant savings for companies. It is true – I agree with the rapporteur and the Commission in this respect – that the issuing of a traditional invoice is three times as expensive as the issuing of an electronic invoice. This innovation is therefore welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I also agree that this proposal will help to develop, strengthen and promote the electronic provision of services, which is one of the great objectives which the European Union established at Lisbon and which will be discussed tomorrow in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I believe that this proposal, while achieving these objectives from the point of view of the simplification of formal obligations, savings in the financial costs to companies and the strengthening of electronic services, in no way jeopardises the administrative control necessary for the application of the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not talk about some of the amendments which Mrs Torres Marques has mentioned, such as the electronic digital signature, because the author of the amendment is Mrs Kauppi, who will explain it much better than me.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say that the amendment which we are presenting in relation to the sequence has not in my view been properly understood by the rapporteur. The Commission proposed that the invoice should have a single number. What we are saying is that it should not necessarily be sequential, and there could be different sequences or collections by client or by country, in order to favour identification from the point of view of the company and, probably, also from the point of view of the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the rapporteur’s regret, which this Parliament makes abundantly clear every time valued added tax is discussed: the Commission lacks audacity when it comes to progressing towards a definitive system for value added tax, which would simplify it enormously and which, at a time of so many problems for European integration, would provide clear and firm backing and a clear message that we are prepared to turn value added tax into what its founder, Maurice Lauré, called the first European tax.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a modest step, since it only involves administrative obligations, formal obligations, that is, certain secondary aspects of the tax, but it seems to me a step in the right direction. My Group will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that Mrs Torres Marques’s report is a good one. The preliminary report was also a good one. And that report has been greatly improved since passing through committee thanks to the generosity of the rapporteur, who has accepted a good number of amendments. The procedure we are now undergoing is a consultation procedure, it is modest, but this committee – given the number of amendments it has presented – has worked very seriously on drafting this report. I hope the Commission will respond generously to the serious work of the European Parliament’s committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are frequent announcements of good intentions to simplify tax rules. In actual fact, however, the measures are instead directed at keeping tax competition within the Union in check. This is particularly true of all measures which seek to harmonise tax rates, for the simple reason that it is highly unlikely that it will be agreed to align with those countries which have lower tax rates. Usually only the opposite approach is possible. This means that states with leaner governments and lower rates of tax are actually forced to levy taxes which they do not even need.</p>
<p class="contents">This Council proposal to amend Directive 77/388 should be seen in a quite different light, because the purpose of the proposed measures is actually to simplify matters for taxpayers throughout Europe. The amendments seek above all to reduce companies' administrative costs and thus strengthen competition. For this reason we can support these amendments which contribute to a genuine simplification of our tax legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal and Mrs Torres Marques’ excellent report promote this trend. Administrative burdens place particular pressure on small- and medium-sized businesses which, due to their small size, have to put relatively more energy into complying with regulations than large businesses. Our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is also already proposing, in its first amendment to the Commission’s proposal, that the national authorities which have the authority to act must always ensure that complying with this directive will not cause SMEs additional, unnecessary administrative burdens. Simplifying Community law must always have the consequence of reducing the administrative burden on SMEs. Bearing this in mind, it is also very important that tomorrow we will be voting on the Committee’s Amendment No 18, which I initiated, becoming part of the final opinion of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, legislation renewing and modernising requirements governing invoicing must constantly take into account the opportunities offered by growing e-commerce and the new demands this makes. A recently published Nordic study stated that by 2005 approximately 80% of company invoices will be transferred electronically. At the moment this figure is 10%. Billing electronically is estimated to halve the cost of invoicing in the Nordic Countries. So the significance is far from small.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic signatures, referred to in Amendment No 18, can be one way of ensuring that invoices transferred electronically are genuine and that their content has not been interfered with but it is not the only way. The experience gained from Member States where electronic invoicing is permitted shows that the lack of electronic signatures has not caused problems for auditors or any other parties requiring this information. Using advanced electronic signatures must not be compulsory. It would be a retrograde step for those Member States which have already accepted electronic invoicing for some time without electronic signatures being required. The question of the security of doing business over the Internet must not be combined with the legal requirements for Value Added Tax. I also hope that Mrs Torres Marques will further consider her opinion before the voting tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, it gives me great pleasure to discuss the Commission's proposal on invoicing with Parliament today. This proposal stems from the SLIM exercise, during which traders themselves identified the current divergent rules on invoicing in Europe as a major obstacle to the smooth running of the internal market and the development of electronic commerce. It is an important element of the new VAT strategy adopted by the Commission last June focussing, in the short term, on simplifying and modernising the present VAT system.</p>
<p class="contents">Two problems have been pinpointed. Firstly, there are the 15 different sets of rules on VAT invoicing that place an enormous administrative burden on business. Various speakers have already drawn attention to that tonight. The compulsory set of requirements is indeed different in each Member State. This means that when a trader makes taxable supplies to several Member States, he has to respect different obligations when drawing up invoices in each of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that the current legal framework for electronic invoicing also differs across Europe. In most cases it is very restrictive. Electronic invoicing is sometimes not possible at all. When it is allowed, it is subject to diverse technical requirements or to prior authorisation from the tax administrations. It is therefore extremely difficult to use it in cross-border trade. Hence the need to set up a common legal framework, for both paper and electronic invoicing. That is why the objectives of the present proposal are the following: firstly, to create a common set of 12 obligatory VAT requirements on invoices across the European Union; secondly, to set up a common legal framework for electronic transmission and storage of invoices.</p>
<p class="contents">By creating a single set of rules, such a new framework will enable businesses to save on administrative costs. Moreover, I should like to stress that this proposal will also enable tax administrations to carry out tax audits more efficiently. I am pleased to say that this opinion is shared by the European Parliament – as evidenced by the report drawn up by the rapporteur, for which I thank her very much indeed, on of the Commission's behalf. The Commission would like, in particular, to welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Torres Marques, as well as the helpful ideas put forward by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, in her opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Given that the Council is currently considering this proposal, and in view of the Commission's strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this stage would be for the Commission not to accept formally the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board as much as possible during the negotiations with the Council. However, it will not be possible, I am afraid, to take into account some amendments, in particular those relating to the advanced electronic signature, which the rapporteur proposes to make optional rather than mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that the Commission's proposal is already a compromise between the most flexible and most restrictive legislation. But I should also like to stress that the electronic signature is an important tool in securing the authenticity and integrity of what is, after all, a valuable commercial document granting the right to VAT deductions.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the argument that there is a need to postpone the date of entry into force, to enable businesses to adapt to the new rules. But such a date could only be decided once the Council has reached agreement on the content of the proposal. I personally am confident that such an agreement will be reached rapidly. The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail and it will do its best to come to an agreement before the end of this year, as requested by the Stockholm Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to make two remarks to Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mrs Kauppi. Mr García-Margallo y Marfil has reproached the Commission for not supporting the strategy which would lead to a single VAT system. The Commission's ambition remains that of a single point-of-origin VAT system. But the complaints and reproaches which Mr García-Margallo y Marfil directs at the Commission should be addressed to the Member States, since it is with them that the problem lies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kauppi made a remark about the costs of electronic signatures, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. I remind her that the costs cannot be a real obstacle, since these signatures are inexpensive. One can buy the cheapest ones for EUR 20 or EUR 30. The savings in administrative costs more than outweigh initial outlay.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Parliament's support for this proposal is important in order to achieve a good result. I thank Parliament and the rapporteur very much indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am the unwitting victim of information technology, as I had the timetable up on screen and I thought that I was due to speak at around 9.45 a.m. Thank you for allowing me to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation in the fifteen countries of the European Union is, in truth, absurd. There are 15 regulations and 25 different types of compulsory statements on the invoicing of VAT, but what is unfair is the very existence of VAT, and not the way in which it is invoiced.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we shall be voting against this report, it is not in order to oppose harmonisation, but in order to express our opposition to the very existence of value added tax, and, more generally, to any indirect tax on consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a particularly unfair tax, because everyone has to pay it, including those who only earn a modest wage, even those who are living on unemployment benefit. The consumer becomes a tax payer simply by making a purchase, even if it is just a loaf of bread. What is worse is that VAT is not calculated according to the income of the tax payer. A billionaire will pay tax at exactly the same rate as an employee earning the lowest income.</p>
<p class="contents">In a country such as France, VAT makes up almost three quarters of the government’s revenue, in other words, twice the amount of tax on salaries. This means that it is the working people within the population, those on lower incomes and resources who are paying the greater share of taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfair in itself, and all the more so because, with regard to State spending, on the other hand, there is a trend to increase spending to favour large employers and the wealthy, to the detriment of public services. Whereas taxation should help to reduce the gap between the richest and the poorest, it is actually making it wider.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of phasing out all forms of indirect taxation throughout Europe and of replacing it with a consistent increase of tax on company profits, as well as a tax on income, which increases steeply, particularly on high income from capital. This would also have the added advantage of solving the problem of harmonising invoicing which is of concern to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
