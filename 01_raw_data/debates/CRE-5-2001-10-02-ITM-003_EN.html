The fact that I have been given the opportunity to speak on this particular day is all the more appropriate given that your Parliament is being called to vote on two reports, which are of a very high quality and which are particularly important for our future work in the Justice and Home Affairs Council: Mr Pirker's report on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy and Mr Evans's report on the Commission communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for persons granted asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">When I introduced the presidency’s programme to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I mentioned the fact that our presidency had made these two areas – asylum on the one hand and immigration on the other – a priority, and said that there were several reasons for our doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I note, echoing my European colleagues, that the public have a genuine expectation here, a legitimate expectation, and it is our duty as politicians to respond to this urgently, of course, but also, I believe, to provide some reassurance. This implies managing migratory flows effectively and it also means that we need to take measures to prevent the asylum procedure from being abused. We have to recognise that there is widespread concern about the upward trend in the figures which we are seeing more or less everywhere in Europe. Secondly, the evaluation of Tampere, which will be carried out at the end of our presidency, should allow us to identify the areas in which progress has been made in the field of justice and home affairs, but also to propose measures with a view to remedying any shortcomings revealed as soon as possible, and we have to admit that there are some. To avoid the regrettable consequences of these shortcomings, we think that it is necessary to relaunch the political process at the Laeken Summit. To do this we will need to resolve several issues which, though in the guise of technical difficulties, are in fact the subject of political dispute. I must in addition thank Commissioner Vitorino who always puts forward very sensible proposals, but has also proven to be very open-minded in his concern to make progress and who is willing for his proposals to be challenged if this moves the issue forward at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">With these two points in mind, the Belgian Presidency wanted even now to create the necessary political impetus to provoke a substantial debate on issues such as establishing a common and balanced immigration policy and setting up a European asylum system. In other words, we are working with our colleagues in this presidency to ensure that the Council of Ministers is once again able to play its role as architect of the European edifice and thus focus on settling a number of political disputes. Its legislative work should lead to visible operational activity and cooperation on practical matters between the law enforcement agencies and the immigration authorities. I have to tell you that for my part I am convinced that a common European approach, based on solidarity, is the only viable approach to these matters. We should remember that for a long time many Member States believed that they could tackle this problem on their own. They have to admit, however, that the results have not come up to expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take asylum first of all. The right to asylum is, of course, a priority for all of our countries. Europe’s dignity would not, I believe, allow otherwise. We still wish to see the Geneva Convention applied in full and compliance with it reaffirmed. It seems to me that in this respect our countries have nothing to be ashamed of. The efforts which we are making to meet our international commitments cannot be challenged or called into question. However, it is also apparent to all of us that large numbers of people are using this procedure as a way of entering the territory of our Member States for reasons other than those laid down in the Geneva Convention. I therefore think that we ought to consider what action we might take in the light of these two observations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> In just a few months, the Commission has completed a significant task, producing the proposals for directives which we now need to examine and which concern: harmonising the conditions for the reception of applicants for asylum; harmonising the procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status; revising the Dublin Convention; harmonising refugee status and, finally, subsidiary forms of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we need to see all of these texts as part of an indissociable whole, there is good reason to be self-disciplined about the order in which we examine them. Bearing in mind the timetable set by the Commission scoreboard and the Commission communication on asylum which provides for a two-stage approach, the presidency has decided to focus as a priority on the three following directives: harmonising the common minimum conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers; the Community instrument to succeed the Dublin Convention and harmonising procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">The first two documents have had their first reading, which I might describe as encouraging and from which it was clear that Member States wish to make progress in this field as quickly as possible. As far as harmonising procedures is concerned, I organised an exploratory debate at political level during the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 September, based on specific questions which required specific answers. For example, the Member States had to give their views on how the directive should be structured, and in particular on the criteria to be used to distinguish between admissible applications and manifestly unfounded ones, the number of bodies involved in assessing these criteria, their nature, the appeals mechanism making it possible to refer the matter to them, and how precise to make the qualitative standards for the decisions and the authorities making those decisions. It was proposed to ministers that the same working method be used to examine the directive on family reunification. This exercise made it possible – although it is certainly difficult – to make some progress, particularly on defining the notion of the nuclear family.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the diversity of the national systems in place in our Member States means that any moves to bring them into line with each other will indisputably and necessarily require significant efforts to be made on all sides. None of the Member States can hope that the uniform system will correspond to what it has been familiar with at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond these national differences, however, I did note with satisfaction that we are all working towards the same objective: establishing procedures which are fast and effective – this is very important – but which of course respect the rights of refugee applicants. The presidency will, moreover, continue to make every effort, working in collaboration with the Commission, to meet this objective as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I welcome the recommendations made in Mr Evans’s report, which seek to flesh out the provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions with a view to implementing this common European asylum regime. Our response to this issue has to be a joint one, based on solidarity. Europe needs to toe the same political line where admitting refugees onto its territory is concerned and needs to act together to stamp out the underground activity which this provokes. If we ascertain that procedures are being abused, we obviously need to find solutions to situations of human distress. Europe needs to work along these lines to improve conflict prevention, and also, through its cooperation programmes, to establish better living conditions throughout the world. Organising information campaigns in the countries of origin should make it possible to combat illegal immigration, but also to thwart the plans of criminal organisations which are at the origin of this modern form of slavery and which do not hesitate to have recourse to any means, in particular violence and terror, to achieve their ends. Exploiting these flows of refugee applicants for criminal purposes is an additional concern for the whole of the European Union and it is our duty to respond to this by adopting emergency measures to act as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with this in mind that we raised the issue of trafficking in human beings during the open debate with the accession countries at the Council meeting of 28 September and decided on measures to take in this field by adopting operational conclusions. This package of measures can and must range from measures to protect victims to police-related measures such as reinforcing checks at Europe’s current and future external borders, while safeguarding the possibility for those who are fleeing persecution to find asylum in our countries. Finally I agree that we need to draw a clear distinction in the measures which we put in place between asylum-seekers looking for international protection and those who want to enter the European Union for other reasons, which are incidentally sometimes legitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of openness and mobility, this is certainly not about transforming Europe into a 'fortress' but about reflecting on how we can manage immigration in a transparent, realistic and balanced way. I do not have any ready-made answers to these questions; instead we have elected to organise – in collaboration with the European Parliament and the Commission – a European Conference on Migration, which will be held on 16 and 17 October in Brussels. I should like, Mr President, to take advantage of the fact that this event will soon be upon us to thank you for the considerable support which this Parliament has given us in organising this meeting, which is, I believe, unprecedented, and which will bring together expert observers of these phenomena which are a real problem in today's society. The Brussels hemicycle of the European Parliament is a prestigious venue and symbolises the fruitful collaboration between the European institutions, which, on an issue such as immigration, is quite obviously vital.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I hope that many Members of this Parliament will attend the conference, thus fostering a rich and productive debate. This event, to which we will have the honour of welcoming ministers, senior officials from international institutions and politicians, will provide an opportunity to hold an in-depth political debate on migratory flows, the issues at stake and their consequences. It will allow us to get a general idea of the way in which migratory flows should be addressed within a common European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the conference the floor will be open for contributions from all participants which should help us – and this is our political objective – to make some essential choices at the Laeken European Summit. The idea is to reinject momentum into the search for a global approach towards migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are all aware that these questions of principle conceal a certain tendency for people to exploit the phenomenon for economic and even political ends and we cannot ignore this. Significant migratory flows head for Europe, either abusing the procedures which were designed for completely different purposes or, even, entering Europe completely illegally, which is of course just as reprehensible. A large number of these illegal migrants also benefit from criminal help, both abroad and in our own countries. Obviously these abuses of the system sustain those who try to exploit the migratory phenomena for economic purposes or to achieve political aims and we cannot remain indifferent to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to see that the issues which will be debated during the conference are the same as those raised in Mr Pirker’s report on immigration. How can we manage migratory flows successfully? How can we draw a clear distinction between asylum and immigration? What impact would relaxing the conditions governing the entry of immigrants have on illegal immigration? Do our Member States need a new wave of economic migration? Is this need felt to the same extent across the Union? What consequences does the fight against the shadow economy have for illegal immigration? What are the undesirable consequences of the migration of qualified labour and how can we counter them? In which areas do we work together with the countries of origin? What instruments can we put in place to establish a genuine policy of integration?</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency believes that this is not simply a question of resolving technical issues: everyone knows that these matters are highly charged, economically and politically, but also at a purely human level. We need to take account of many phenomena, including underground ones, which makes establishing a common immigration policy particularly complex, especially from an economic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before drawing to a close, I should like to remind you of our desire to work in full institutional collaboration with you, the European Parliament, within the rules laid down in the treaties, in the hope that together we will be able to take further steps towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice which will benefit Europe and the people of Europe. This is already the third time that I have had the pleasure of addressing you. This is not an onerous task; it is an honour, and I am delighted to be able to work together with you.</p>

<p class="contents">Both of these should be essential stages in the process of drawing up common immigration and asylum policies. In adopting the two resolutions which are on the table today, whose quality and balance should be saluted – and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Pirker and Mr Evans – the European Parliament will, I am sure, express clear and forceful priorities in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union has been confronted with a new political agenda in the fields of justice and home affairs. Thanks in particular to the determination of the Belgian Presidency, it has so far been facing up to this remarkably well.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council of 21 September sent out a very clear message to us. We should adopt as a matter of urgency the measures necessary to reinforce the internal security of our Member States and their nationals while making the fight against terrorism a priority. At the same time, however, the European Council of 21 September emphasised that neither should we stop working on other issues set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam and thus towards our objective of safeguarding and developing an area of freedom, security and justice. I am delighted that the European Council underlined the need to strike a political balance between stepping up police and judicial cooperation with a view to combating crime and terrorism, on the one hand, and establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, that is protecting the fundamental rights of the public, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always stressed in these debates here with the European Parliament, but also with the Council, that we need common immigration and asylum policies more than ever. The relevance of both the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions has been repeatedly reaffirmed. I am convinced that the public genuinely expects, and even demands, the addition of European value to national policies whose limitations are becoming ever more apparent, whether they be security policies or policies to protect civil liberties. To achieve an objective of this kind and identify the European added value which we can bring to national policies, I believe that we should take into account both the security imperatives and the respect for values which are the common defining values of our European Union, including the freedom of movement which is guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has asked the Commission to evaluate its proposals on asylum and immigration in the light of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America. We have already buckled down to this task. The political will to move forward on these matters which was reaffirmed by both the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council should give us new hope. As the Minister emphasised just now, it is true that the slow progress and the difficulties which we have encountered on certain dossiers could cast serious doubt on our ability to take substantial decisions within the very strict deadlines in the Commission timetable. This new momentum should benefit all aspects of our cooperation on justice and home affairs, provided that the Member States recognise that it is impossible to have European legislation which is a faithful copy of fifteen national laws and that they will each have to give some ground in the search for a common solution from which they will all benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the substance of today’s debate is concerned, I note that there is broad convergence between the Commission’s views and those of Parliament, as reflected in the two excellent reports by Mr Pirker and Mr Evans. Whether they concern the principles on which the common European asylum regime should be based or the components of a coherent approach towards the migration phenomenon, we do not have any difficulty in going along with most of your recommendations. In some cases we have even anticipated them and several of your requests are already taken into account in our proposals on the legal status of long-term residents and on admission for employment purposes, or again in our communication of last July which followed on from the one of November 2000 and went into more detail on some of the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, we are preparing to follow them up, for example in the communications which I intend to propose to the Commission for adoption in the coming months, the first of which concerns the fight against illegal immigration and the second repatriation policies and external border checks. I also share your concern about the need to develop practical proposals to build a real partnership between the Union and the countries of origin and transit. We have started work on this by setting up a high-level group, whose mandate will be extended thanks to the implementation of a new budgetary instrument with the strong backing of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, people may feel that this work and the implementation of the action plans adopted by the Council are not bearing sufficient fruit. I therefore agree that in general we should recognise the significance of these migratory phenomena by giving them greater consideration when we are formulating the European Union’s external policy. To a certain extent we have to recognise that we are hostages of the division between the second and third pillars, which is completely unjustified because on closer inspection the very close links between the European Union’s development and migration policies become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also insist on the fact that a genuine European policy on immigration and asylum will not exist – over and above the legislative framework – unless national policies also converge in practice and in pursuit of common objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is the aim of the Commission's proposed open coordination policy, which is similar to the method already used – incidentally with success – for employment, for example. An open coordination method of this kind seems to me to have the advantages of flexibility and transparency as well as respecting subsidiarity, while providing a powerful incentive to harmonise legislation and national practice – even spontaneously I would say – and being a good indicator of the areas in which Community intervention is really essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It requires the Member States to agree in the Council on common guidelines proposed to them by the Commission after a broad process of consultation. They will then have to implement them at national level using the national legislative and administrative means at their disposal. The Member States will be invited to draw up national reports every year in which they will have to take stock of the progress which they have made in implementing these common guidelines. The Commission's summary of these reports should make it possible to identify, on a case-by-case basis, the weak points in the essential convergence exercise and, if necessary, to refine and add to the common guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, we put forward a first set of guidelines concerning the management of migratory flows, the admission of economic migrants, partnership with third countries and the integration of third-country nationals into our societies. Further proposals will be made for asylum when we publish the first report on the follow-up to our communication of November 2000, which will be sent to you in the coming months. The Commission hopes that the Council and the European Council will give these new guidelines their blessing so that implementation can start immediately and a first complete round be conducted in the course of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to come back to some fundamental principles which in the current circumstances it is, more than ever, important to reiterate.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, asylum is a right which is guaranteed and regulated by international instruments and confirmed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. No one will dispute the fact that it may be abused. And it is up to us, as politicians, to put a stop to this, not by further weakening the position of those who really need international protection, but – and this is a better bet – by aligning the procedures and criteria applied at national level and making them more effective. The introduction, in the medium term, of a one-stop shop, which you support in your resolution, would, therefore, unquestionably be a significant step forward in my opinion. In the meantime, it would seem to be essential to endeavour to improve the quality of initial decisions, as recommended in our proposal on asylum procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we cannot deny that immigration occurs. It would be eminently regrettable if some people were to take advantage of current feeling to revert to a policy of slogans. Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem. Above all, name-calling, which is an accessory of racist and xenophobic sentiment, must be avoided. What we do have is a genuine policy to manage migratory flows at both national and European level. And the terms of reference would appear to me to be obvious. Legal immigration channels need to be clearly identified and the possibilities which they represent need to be quantified, not on the basis of the unexpected whims and uncertainties of the economic cycle, but on the basis of a realistic assessment of our societies’ structural needs and how many immigrants they would be able to accommodate. A dialogue with the countries of departure is necessary and it is important to take into account the different types of immigration with which we are faced. Some immigrants are long-term and are expected to stay in their host societies for good, but others – and there are increasing numbers of them – are part of cyclical migration flows, which implies – and this should be encouraged – that they will maintain a stronger link with their region of origin. Finally, the credibility of a proactive immigration policy must be consolidated by an effective campaign to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings which is associated with it. We should give serious thought to creating a major new Community instrument, alongside those which are designed to combat exclusion, which might, for example, address the specific problem of integrating immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, cultural pluralism is becoming a characteristic of our societies, particularly in urban areas, which raises very serious challenges. It may inject real dynamism into society if it is based on genuine mutual tolerance. But it may also be the source of confrontation and social division. This mutual tolerance and respect will be one of the keys to social balance and cultural progress in our European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the European Parliament for helping to enrich this debate, which I sincerely hope will be brought to a positive conclusion. Through the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency and with the personal commitment of the Minister, Mr Duquesne – whom I should like to thank and whose efforts to reach compromises in a true European spirit I can vouch for – I hope that Laeken will constitute a major step towards establishing the area of freedom, security and justice. This is not a dream; it is a reality which the public is increasingly keen to experience.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, as we all know, the last few weeks have been very difficult and we will continue to live in challenging times for many months and years ahead. Therefore, this is a very important debate, and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President-in-Office, Mr Duquesne, are here in person, recognising the importance of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Duquesne implied in his contribution, if the recent happenings have shown us anything, it is that we cannot turn a blind eye to events around the world and hope that they will go away. The problems of people wanting asylum, the situation and the plight of the people of poor and troubled countries all over the world are our concerns and they manifest themselves on our doorsteps, on our shores and in our parliaments if we do not address them.</p>
<p class="contents">At one level these problems manifest themselves as debates in this and other parliamentary assemblies. At the worst level we find bodies in lorries at Dover, on the beaches of Spain and other countries. This is the plight of desperate people seeking desperate measures to start a new life. But these people are not resorting to this sort of action lightly; they are escaping from terror, war, torture, rape, vile regimes posing as governments and, of course, in some cases, poverty. So there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the EU Heads of Government for having brought asylum into the Community competence and setting a progressive agenda at Tampere. I congratulate the Commission on these proposals, which have started the debate on how a common asylum policy should be shaped.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report before Parliament today I am asking for a common and wider interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1951, a clearer definition of who should be recognised as a refugee and one that is consistent across all 15 countries. Let us also harmonise the treatment asylum seekers receive; let us establish Europe-wide common standards and then make sure that we enforce them.</p>
<p class="contents">If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights, as the Minister and the Commissioner have said, for refugees, for access to welfare, housing, education, health care – things that we in the privileged world take for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years it sometimes seemed that EU countries were competing to become the least attractive to potential asylum seekers. Common, Europe-wide standards will inevitably create a more balanced distribution of asylum claims throughout the EU. That must help my city, London, and all the major cities of Europe. It must also stop countries being able to lower their standards, which will be good for asylum seekers, who can be more confident of a fair hearing. That is something of which we should be proud and not ashamed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition and crucially, Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees. Governments must make concerted efforts to help create peace in the troubled parts of the world, however difficult, and to increase aid to developing countries – strong measures that in time will work towards countering the pressures that force people to migrate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for the same reasons that we must press ahead with the enlargement of the European Union. As Commissioner Verheugen said recently, we cannot ask ourselves the question: can we afford enlargement of the European Union? Instead we should put the question: can we afford not to enlarge the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In committee, many centre-right and right-wing Members voted against my report in whole or in part. I challenge those Members who are sitting opposite today, not to just give a prepared speech or ignore what I am saying now but to tell us why they are opposing certain parts of it and why they want to diminish the rights of a fair appeal, which is Amendments Nos 6 and 8 by Mr Schmitt. How will this make the system better? To those – perhaps the British Conservatives – who will vote against this report in its entirety, if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies. They must recognise that this is a global issue and one that cannot be dealt with on an individual basis in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">I sympathise with Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Green Group, but I cannot support them. We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters. However, this is a compassionate report, one with which we can be satisfied but not complacent.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation. I thank my own group staff for their hard work and I pay tribute to the NGOs that have contributed valuable ideas. I commend the report to Parliament.</p>

We have noted that you have a good grasp of the issue and are interested in really achieving something here. If this can be done in conjunction with the Commission and Parliament, then we can look forward to some real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is now clearly taking things seriously and is for the first time making a genuine attempt at a systematic approach toward migration policy. We have accordingly clearly established that there are three groups of migrants requiring different measures and different legal arrangements, and that there are also issues which cut across the three groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the three groups first. We have economic migrants, and my report addresses how they are received in the individual Member States, depending on the facilities and needs of those Member States. Then we have asylum-seekers, who are recognised as refugees under the Geneva Convention. I firmly believe that the Geneva Convention should on no account be watered down or departed from, either by extending or by diluting the grounds for granting refugee status. What we need are swift and safe decisions for refugees and European minimum standards for the procedures involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group covers war refugees, that is refugees who come to us temporarily and need a different kind of help again. Issues which cut across the three groups include family reunification and combating trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration. That means that we have a complicated system before us. My report is concerned exclusively with immigration on economic grounds and was adopted with six votes against, so that it achieved a fairly broad consensus. I would like to express my sincere thanks for the extremely constructive and positive cooperation between the wide variety of political groups in this House, which made it possible to create a broad basis for a new approach to immigration into the European Union on economic grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social, economic and political stability in the European Union. However, in view of the events of 11 September, we also need increased vigilance when it comes to the hospitality, aid and freedoms offered by the Union, to make sure that these are not abused by individual elements to breach the security of Europe's citizens or of the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be clear to us, as I stated at the beginning of my report, that we cannot counter demographic trends by means of immigration alone, but that the only really good and meaningful approach is, of course, an enhanced education policy and family policy. It must also be clear that we have to give the integration of third country nationals living here legally higher priority than new immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the core issues in my report? It is evident that when it comes to immigration the European Union can only take on certain tasks and that a great deal must remain a matter for the Member States. Another issue that must remain in the hands of the Member States is what workers and how many workers should be given residence permits and work permits for a particular Member State, depending on that State's needs and facilities. It is also evident that if integration is to be successful, factors such as the availability of suitable work and housing must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is what we expect of immigrants, by which I mean their willingness to integrate and to recognise the Community of values. Conversely, there should also be an obligation on the Member States to provide an appropriate level of support for integration. At EU level it is a question of determining conditions for the entry and residence of these migrants and drawing up a coherent system for granting visas, of regulating the ability of third country nationals to move between Member States and the introduction of measures to counter trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration, and also cooperation and information campaigns in and with the countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee in principle welcomes all the Commission's proposals on the immigration of workers. I hope that the broad consensus that we achieved in committee will be repeated when we vote here in the plenary.</p>

In the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Defence Policy to this report, however, a number of recommendations were made which, precisely against the backdrop of 11 September, are very pertinent indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has often called for a common and unambiguous policy on evaluating whether or not countries are safe. It is not acceptable that some Member States should declare countries safe, therefore refuse to receive refugees and asylum seekers, while other countries do.</p>
<p class="contents">The security services and embassies of our Member States should join forces in this respect. Since 1992, there has been a structure in place, comprising CIREA and the High Level Working Group, but they do not operate well together. And they certainly do not work well with the Member States. We are therefore asking for an improved and transparent structure to be introduced in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, in a Union with open borders, discrepancies in admissions policy are untenable, and a joint foreign policy is also totally inappropriate if we fail to sing from the same hymn sheet. In that sense, I would make an urgent appeal to the Commission to do something about this. Afghanistan is, in fact, a good illustration of how things can work.</p>
<p class="contents">A second observation pertains to the aid to those countries that receive large groups of refugees. We should provide far more aid to those countries, and especially the UNHCR. In principle, it is better for people who flee to remain in the vicinity of their own country, so that they can return quickly. But they do need support. However, the UNHCR resources have been cut back drastically by the European Commission, and we believe that this situation should be improved promptly. Moreover, we also believe that people should receive more education in the camps so that they do not fall victim to radicalism and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to point at the need to be a lot more pro-active in terms of conflict prevention. It would be of great benefit to us if we could close the ranks better in the EU in this respect. In that way, conflict could be prevented. The recommendations made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have been adopted unanimously in the committee. It would be unfortunate, in my opinion, if Mr Evans’ report would lead to diversity. I would like to dare him to work closely with the other groups in order to reach unanimity. We would then, at least, be able to support his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One, to take on Europe’s shared historic responsibility for this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Two, to consider immigration as a positive and irreversible phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, to consider the harmony that should exist between the free movement of capital and goods on the one hand, and the free movement of persons on the other.</p>

<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council told us in all honesty that Council is at present rather confused about asylum and immigration policies. Commissioner Vitorino, who has undertaken magnificent work in this field, told us that, in the area of immigration and asylum, Community institutions currently find themselves caught between two stools: that is to say between the first and the third pillars. That is to say that immigration and asylum policies, at this moment in time, appear on the one hand in the Treaty establishing the European Community and yet there is no clear Community competence in the field of asylum and immigration. Also, it is very strange that the Heads of State and Government in Tampere made grandiose statements about a European immigration policy, but we do not know if these will actually be converted into Community Law.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have highlighted the inconsistencies between the declarations by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere and the commitments given in the Community Treaties. I think that the Conference on immigration, which the President-in-Office of the Council informed us would take place within the next two weeks and at which I think there will be significant participation by Members of the European Parliament, will be an opportunity for the three Community institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to formulate, or to at least start to formulate, the need to give a Community legal basis to the problem of immigration, for, in this case, we have a genuine Community-wide problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to immigration we cannot talk of subsidiarity. The problem of immigration is, at this moment, common to all European countries, and Commissioner Vitorino, in carrying out the work on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy, is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Commission’s strategy is suitable, but we need to strengthen it from the constitutional angle with the appropriate modification of the Community Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the recognition that a restrictive approach to immigration has not worked and is counter-productive. We have only to look at the increase in trafficking and the difficulty in recruiting skilled professionals to demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that there is work available in the European Union for people from third countries. In many of our countries they are crucial to agricultural production and many major companies employ third-country nationals in senior executive posts. Yet there is still an attitude around that we are doing such people a favour by allowing them to enter the EU to support our economy and our social security system. Let us be honest: we want them to help maintain our standard of living. If we get it right, it should be a mutual benefit. As part of that, we need to ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals, not least in the workplace. The implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination is also crucial. Why work here, if you then face racism and xenophobia?</p>
<p class="contents">Business tells us that recruitment needs to be made easier and more flexible at all skill levels. This calls into question work permits attached to a particular job and company. Unfortunately, the lead committee did not take this on board. Recruitment is also hampered by restrictions on family reunion, business tells us. My political group has tabled amendments relating to that human factor. The working rights of partners also need to be improved. We have also to recognise the fact that some migrants will wish to stay and settle. This is important in terms of continuity and stability for individuals, society and business. A constant turnover is problematic on many levels and we have to remember that we are human beings, not cogs in an economic wheel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In most cases, the hallmark of national policies on immigration is a lack of vision and creativity and a fear of domination by foreign influences. However, there is now no disputing that immigration has taken place on a substantial scale and that immigration will and must take place in future. The detailed reasons for this are to be found in the 28 pages of the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's shift to an active immigration policy is very much to be welcomed. The Commission recognises that pressures to migrate will continue and that regulated immigration can be advantageous for the EU, for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin. This change in policy does, however, also mean that decisions will have to be taken and that it is not sufficient merely to administer immigration by hiding behind general political guidelines, or, in the words of the rapporteur, on the basis of the cornerstones of immigration policy. That would mean that we would never achieve a Community migration policy as laid down in the Tampere conclusions. Instead, immigration would remain a national responsibility for Member States, with all their shortcomings, with just a basic framework at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, a long-term immigration policy can reduce the pressure from illegal immigration, from trafficking in human beings, from illegal employment and from the economic exploitation of migrants. Third country nationals must be given the same rights as EU citizens, as the Commission assumes in its communication, and they should be able to contribute to the local economy through their work; only in this way will the sort of integration we want take place.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Boetticher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset, Commissioner Vitorino. Various possible scenarios have been presented and the possibilities for a common procedure and common principles have been investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret that in contrast to the Pirker report it was not possible to achieve a broad compromise in committee. Unfortunately, in the case of the Evans report, instead of a reasonable consensus emerging, it was ideology that won the day. It is intended that both the grounds on which asylum is granted and the procedures involved should be extended across Europe. This is despite the fact, as you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that at present some 90% of asylum-seekers apply for asylum on purely economic grounds and are therefore rejected, and despite the fact that the present checking procedures can take up to eight years. I am sure that it is only possible to agree to extensions of this kind if you have totally lost sight of the position in your own country.</p>
<p class="contents">What will the impact on us be if arrangements of the kind Mr Evans is presenting to us today become a reality, and if in future persecution by non-State agents and gender-related persecution are recognised? In practice this would amount to granting an unlimited right of residence in the EU to most families in the Islamic world. Why is that? Let me explain. No one would deny that in every Islamic country there are fundamentalist groups that use Islam to discriminate against women's rights, from the perspective of our system of values. Which means that any woman in an Islamic State can make a valid claim of persecution by non-State groups. If this were to be recognised in the EU, she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her.</p>
<p class="contents">So the question we need to ask here is this: do we want to and are we able here in Europe to solve the problems of the Islamic world and the problems of the Islamic view of women? I have a clear answer to that: no! And the picture is even clearer now that we are all aware of the problems and risks that have arisen over the last few weeks. At the same time, Mr Evans, contrary to his original statement, wishes to abolish the concept of a safe third country and thus burden the in any case protracted procedures with additional checks. My own conclusion is therefore that in its present form the Evans report is irresponsible. It gives the Member States sufficient arguments for refusing to give us the right of codecision when further EU reforms in this area are being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that there is a majority in this House that is not yet mature enough to be given such responsibility. Mr Evans, if you are advocating an extension of the right of asylum here, then I would ask you what steps your own party, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, has taken in this direction in recent years? I can tell you that it has certainly not dealt with things in this way. That is because it does not have the support of a majority of the population for such steps and Labour could otherwise expect to be voted out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to be quite explicit about this, and it is obvious in any case: if we try to standardise every detail of the right of asylum across Europe in future, we will be unable to achieve agreement on this in the Council of Ministers. That is why I am specifically asking you and advising you to limit harmonisation to the necessary minimum standards.</p>

<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, political decision-makers can react in two ways: either by exploiting people’s fears to their own advantage, at least in the short term, or by attempting to manage the different aspects of immigration as best they can, bravely explaining the reasons for this phenomenon, the benefits it brings our societies, its more problematic aspects and the policies that are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen some examples of this first approach right here this very morning. In its two communications, the Commission has, fortunately, positioned itself firmly in the second camp, and we can only congratulate the Commissioner for this and show our approval. It has also achieved this – I would like to stress – in accordance with the agreements and mandates reached at the European Council in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I fully subscribe to everything my friend and colleague, Mr Evans, said about asylum, I would like to focus during the short speaking time available to me on the communication on immigration and the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Both define a clear path to be followed. The communication discusses, and the report also focuses on, the external and internal causes of immigration, the need for codevelopment policies and a new partnership with the countries of origin, a common European legislative framework to organise entry in a fair, transparent and straightforward way, residency and integration, which to me means rights. Only after this does it talk, once these standards have been established, of addressing the subject of illegal immigration, because we need legal channels to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the report speaks, and we shall be discussing this here in detail when we see the legislative proposals, of establishing new immigration policies in the twenty-first century for a new society and a new economy, that cannot simply be a rehash of guest worker policies from the industrial societies of the 1960s.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will also align itself with those politicians who want to broach this subject clearly and courageously. I really hope this will be the case and I say this in the full knowledge that, on the subject of immigration, we are speaking with both our minds and our hearts – I say this knowing that listening to me today are EU citizens, some by birth and others through choice, all invited by my colleague Mr Aparicio, and who have high expectations of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will try to prove equal to events, and, despite the fact that on occasions events make things difficult for us, we are going to try, and this is something that has never been done by the PPE-DE Group with regard to asylum, to give strong support to this Commission communication and we hope in exchange, Mr President, that the European Council at Laeken will be able to once again initiate a dynamic and robust policy that will allow us to tackle this much needed common immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a curious feature of the construction of Europe that more opportunities for cross-border cooperation have been taken by commerce and criminals than by civil servants, and it is about time our national public administrations made a real effort to get out of their bunkers.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation at Sangatte, near Calais, has featured often on television screens in my home country in recent months. The UK can reflect on why so many people wish to come to our country and especially to my city, London. I like to think, at least in part, that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society, but we cannot just have an open door, and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved. There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and 'pass the parcel' by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need consistency. It is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan, implying that they are undeserving scroungers, when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive, and even deserving of military attack. Even if not everyone from such countries can be judged refugees under the strict Geneva Convention criteria, but only as escaping mere misery, there is no call to demonise them. We must also be consistent about our attitude to women. If we think, as we do, that women's human rights in Afghanistan are grossly denied, we must take account of that in deciding asylum claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not weaken or lower the standards of our asylum systems under the guise of fighting terrorism, as the British Home Secretary is threatening to do. There are adequate powers to detain and deport if security is threatened. Speedy decisions are those based on high-quality procedures and efficiency such as that offered by the functioning immigration service computers which the UK lacks – not on removing appeal rights for all applicants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, we welcome the two Commission communications, which examine these complex issues in great depth. Thus, instead of ineffective, inappropriate immigration policies which make illegal immigration an inherent part of the system, they propose a flexible approach with provisions for managing flows and integrating third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that our rapporteur on immigration should have focused on exploiting the management of migratory flows for the economic and demographic ends of the countries in the Union, without showing concern for the human factor. To implement these proposals on an intergovernmental basis, as Mr Pirker wishes, would not only be a step backwards compared with the Treaty of Amsterdam; it would also show contempt for the need to make immigration and asylum policy a Community instrument and above all it would be a refusal to recognise what is really happening on the ground, which can be seen every day at Sangatte and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we urgently need to correct the misconception that, ‘immigration equals workers’. The notion of a ‘migrant worker’ does not actually take account of what really happens when people immigrate with members of their family, including students or retired people. Let us remember that the right to live as part of a family is a fundamental right which no country can deny. There is therefore a strong case in favour of talking about 'residents' and – why not – ‘European citizens’, assuming that they participate fully. It is the Member States’ duty to take the necessary measures to ensure that all European residents are fully integrated; they achieve this by making sure that everyone has the same rights, including political ones. As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, the only solution that we know of is for the Member States to be responsible for legalising their situation so as to combat all forms of crime, including that committed by traffickers and unscrupulous employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the procedure for examining refugee applications needs to be speeded up. Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigrant refugees’ problems, would be overcome if these applications were dealt with quickly. A great many refugees – a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such – wait for months or years without receiving aid, deprived of work, gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime. It is therefore necessary to shorten these excessively long time periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to understand and establish the fact that the notion of a ‘safe country’ is one that may be overturned by specific evidence of the treatment an individual receives in his or her country. I mean that the notion of a safe country must be a relative assumption, because many refugees flee from a safe country because they are personally persecuted. This notion must not, therefore, be an absolute notion, but the conditions to which the individual refugees have been subjected – in other words, the conditions that have led them to flee to another country – should be examined on a case-by-case basis, and they may lead to the above-mentioned notion of a safe third country being overturned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now more than ever, as the rapporteur has stressed, it is essential to reformulate Community immigration policy: not just aseptic rules allowing or forbidding entry, but a broader and more responsible approach based above all on economic and demographic assessments and evaluations of social and cultural integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs, accommodation, social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States. Setting limits and strict rules means ensuring they get the best possible welcome and are fully integrated, with mutual respect and benefits for both European citizens and the immigrants. It means avoiding painful social conflict, and it also means being tough on illegal immigration, which all too often is associated with crime and exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, Europe cannot confine itself to taking a passive role and attitude towards immigration as if it were just a traffic policeman directing traffic. Europe must act with greater political awareness so that it can also interpret fully the strong motivations underlying these phenomena.</p>
<p class="contents">Very often, or almost always, people from third countries come to Europe out of desperation, poverty, hunger or marginalisation. Their desperation is such that there are mothers who leave their own children and come to our countries in order to earn something for them.</p>
<p class="contents">For this very reason, and also because of its geographical situation, Europe cannot play a merely bureaucratic role, encouraging or limiting immigration. Europe must choose to play a strong, responsible, political role, aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware that it is only by making greater efforts through Third World development programmes and by preventing the so-called brain drain that we can implement the best peace policy of all, which is the fight against poverty and injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, we must be aware that well regulated immigration can bring great benefits to the European Union, to the immigrants themselves and to their countries of origin. But we must be wary of the demagogy of those who propose too permissive an immigration policy, a policy that would encourage Europe to open its borders indiscriminately, reduce controls and extend the right to asylum to an absurd degree, but then to selfishly close our eyes – as we have been doing for years – towards what is happening in the Middle East and the southern countries, as if it had nothing at all to do with us.</p>
<p class="contents">September 11 showed that what happens in those parts of the world affects us closely, and so we should really be convinced, with a little consistency…</p>

This is, of course, scandalous, as the Danish right wing also acknowledges, but ought not the right wing to be content with the fact that the Danish NATO government has obtained military and political benefits from giving shelter to a war criminal? Ought not Saddam’s General to have earned his fare home long ago? Naturally, he has been debriefed by the CIA. That goes without saying. Very discreetly, of course, just as more and more crucial aspects of political life take place in ever more hermetically sealed rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">This baroque situation reflects one of the ambivalent features of Mr Evans’s report, which is otherwise full of engaging features. The report endorses and further develops the finest legal principles we know. The Evans report centres upon persecuted human beings in a way that Mr Pirker’s, which is of course an expression of undisguised worker imperialism, does not. This is appealing and necessary. The problem is that these sound principles are part of political and legal contexts which will in practice reduce them to ideological window dressing. The common asylum and immigration policy is being used first and foremost as an engine for homogenising countries’ extremely different legal traditions by creating an area of freedom, security and justice that is the crucial link in the European superstate. The loser in this disagreeable game is democracy, and the benefit for refugees is doubtful unless one is a general in Saddam Hussein’s army. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the written communication, because both the oral statement which Commissioner Vitorino has just made and that given by the Council were very interesting and much more balanced than what we are accustomed to hearing in this House, and they give us hope that there will be a change in policy following the attacks of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">The written communication in any case is marked by a certain lack of a sense of what is really happening on the ground, the same shortcoming which is responsible for discussions in the Council on the proposals on family reunification being at a standstill today, a fate which may well be reserved in the future for the proposals on asylum which I have criticised, in particular during our last part-session. The written communication focuses on legal immigration, but – apart from a few allusions – it minimises or forgets illegal immigration and the essential fact that today one in every two people emigrating to the industrialised world does so illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am aware that papers have already been tabled on illegal immigration, in particular on trafficking in human beings and on the liability of hauliers, but these are specific texts, tabled, moreover, for the most part by Member States by virtue of their right of initiative, which they still have for the time being. These texts do not show any evidence of an overall grasp of the problem; they are not equal to the challenge. The Commission has just announced that it is going to table further papers following the attacks of 11 September. So much the better. In the meantime, however, if anyone wants to read a good document which clearly sets out the real problems associated with immigration and their possible solutions, they have to refer not to the Commission communication which is being examined today, but to the strategy paper on asylum and immigration, the amended version of which was tabled by the Austrian Presidency on 19 November 1998 – yes, I did say 1998. I would invite listeners of good faith to compare the two texts; they will be staggered by the differences in approach. For example, reading from the Austrian document: Generally speaking, it is no longer only issues related to asylum and the problems of temporary protection but also, and especially, general migration issues, the problems posed by the fight against illegal immigration networks and issues related to expulsion which are at the heart of the political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ought to read it to you in full, but time does not allow and this sentence on its own shows what the real priorities are.</p>

He is a colleague whom we hold in extraordinarily high regard on the basis of our joint work in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and whose opinion I have very little in common with!</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in Europe. It is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe. We need to be clear about two things: first about the quotas to be applied and secondly about the content. As far as the methodology is concerned, European directives on asylum and immigration can only set minimum standards. It is only possible to oblige the European Union as a whole to accept minimum standards. Anything going beyond that will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino's proposals on family reunification may suit some people, but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union. Some revision is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards content, we need to limit and control immigration. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the concept of ‘fortress Europe’. It is precisely because we do not want to erect a fortress Europe and could not do so anyway that we must control and limit immigration. The approach proposed by Commissioner Vitorino does not meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple more examples: by adopting the concept of the safe third country, we in Germany have been able to reduce the number of asylum-seekers from some 450 000 to well under 100 000. Commissioner Vitorino has virtually given up this concept, by making its use dependent on conditions which make it almost impossible to apply in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that binding material grounds for granting asylum are laid down in the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It would be giving asylum-seekers an incentive if we go beyond the binding framework of the Geneva Convention, as in the case of persecution by non-State agents for example. There are some very worthy individual arguments in favour of this, but we cannot allow a higher level of asylum than at present. The problem of asylum is with the procedure. It is still a fact that 90% of all asylum-seekers in Europe are not victims of political persecution. So we need to get the procedure under control. If we can manage to bring the procedure to a rapid conclusion, we can be more generous when it comes to grounds for the granting of asylum. However, this does not sit well with the three-stage asylum procedure that Commissioner Vitorino is proposing, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Vitorino, if Mr Schily, the German Minister for the Interior, who as you know does not belong to the same party as I do, behaves in the same way in Council as he does in Germany then your proposals have no hope at all!</p>

The Evans report, for its part, is no less topical or relevant. This is not the time to step back and it is, therefore, crucial to work towards a solution common to all the Member States with regard to the criteria for assessing requests and to cooperation between national administrative systems. I can see that we will have to confront certain challenges in order to come up with effective regulations. This effort must not only involve the European dimension, however, but also cooperation with third countries, specifically with the asylum seekers’ countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid the ‘Kafakaesque’ situations often described in the European press, it is crucial that we adopt – and we are not asking for much – minimum standards that will ensure faster and simpler procedures for granting asylum so as to prevent the demoralisation and uncertainty that beset asylum seekers. The creation of a space of freedom, security and justice will inevitably involve the need for the mutual recognition of judgments. In order to reach this stage, however, we must first of all harmonise asylum procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this communication, for which Commissioner António Vitorino is responsible, is making a timely appearance on the agenda. On the basis of the framework defined in Tampere, we are committed to create a common policy in the field of asylum, which I am sure will have the support of the Council and of Parliament. Through a joint effort by the Community institutions and civil society we will achieve a platform of understanding, so that by 1 May 2004 the objective outlined by the European Council will be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have a historical responsibility to take this decision and there is no time for hesitation. I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal to agree common admission conditions for migrants and to set up, in addition and alongside this, a policy instrument whereby Member States indicate target figures for work migration, receives the support of the ELDR Group. My group would like to make a few observations with regard to the proposed system.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we reject the policy of zero immigration, but we also reject the policy of completely open borders. A responsible compromise must be struck.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the immigration system must be flexible. Quotas should not be forced upon the Member States from above.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must take account of subsidiarity, that is to say regional and national differences with regard to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, a common immigration policy must also be accompanied by a common fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we must strike the right balance between the need for work forces in industry on the one hand and the unemployed within the European Union on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the ELDR Group calls for a balanced European immigration policy. The Pirker report, for which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, is on the same wavelength. Mr President, these will be my last words in this House since I have now been appointed member of the Council of State in the Netherlands. I would like to thank the fellow MEPs for their kind cooperation and wish them all every success.

I would also thank the representative of the Belgian Presidency, who has just definitively abandoned the idea of a fortress Europe, which it is neither feasible nor desirable to achieve. Finally, I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Evans, for his painstaking work. I believe that it is by applying clear, fair and precise standards that we will not only ensure that refugees are protected but also fight to release them from the grasp of criminal organisations. In my opinion, Mr Evans's painstaking work is in stark contrast to the partisan vision presented by Mr Pirker.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pirker poses some complex questions, but the answers are inadequate and even dangerous. This internal report by Mr Pirker, comprising reflection, analysis and proposals, is one of the weakest which we have had to discuss in this Parliament. Firstly, it contains a series of commonplaces. After a time, it says, immigrants adopt the birth-rate pattern of the host country. As I see it, this is a sign of integration and proof that attitudes change. Instead of being delighted about this, however, Mr Pirker expresses concern about the fact that the destiny of women from the third world, female immigrants who have come from the South, is not confined to having children. He also recommends a policy to recruit a set number of workers which, he says, is supported by the Member States as a way of reducing the labour shortage in certain sectors. For him, immigrants are like Kleenex: you use them and when you no longer need them you throw them away.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a vision of the human being, more particularly black and African, or dark-skinned, human beings who come from the South, which I do not share. Mr Pirker's report deplores family reunification. Mr Pirker's report does, I believe, in many respects, stand in total contradiction to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. Faced with an issue of this complexity, instead of saying that the tragedy in Dover opened our eyes to the possible consequences of immigration, we would have preferred him to consider taking measures against the hauliers who are the real proponents of modern slavery and against the slum landlords …</p>

Those who claimed to forbid any value judgments on civilisations are suddenly waging war on Islam. Others, who rejected any criticism of immigration, are suddenly seeing a potential terrorist in every foreigner. I can tell you straight away that this is not the position of the group of right-wing Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration is a phenomenon on a scale such that it cannot be seen on the same level as acts of terrorism, on which immigrants do not in any case have a monopoly. It is not the immigrants who are guilty, it is those who bring them here for economic reasons, and it may perhaps surprise you to learn that, on this point, I agree in part with what our colleague, Mr Sylla, has just said. It is also those who let themselves sink into a policy of <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, and Mr Pirker’s recitals – I am thinking of recitals M and N – alas give us an example of this, alongside making some positive points. I note in particular, for example, that Paragraph 13 of the report, "takes the view that the various historical, economic and social features in the individual Member States make it impossible to lay down a uniform requirement in labour from third countries which would cover the entire territory of the Union and that, furthermore, the Union has no powers in law in this field."</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are conclusions not drawn from this Paragraph 13? And why not restore sovereignty to the Member States in this regard and with it the legitimate right to protect our borders? After all, the dramatic events which we have witnessed have quite clearly shown that protecting borders was key to security, because this is what the government of the United States immediately did when it found itself in an emergency situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will close by saying that immigration should not be seen as a solution to the falling population which we are seeing in Europe. If the people of Europe abandon to others their duty to give life to new generations, they also abandon their right to live as free nations on the territory of their ancestors. We do not accept this.</p>

However, is it also right that we should lift an immigration ban and adopt a European immigration policy, as the Commission and the majority in this Parliament suggest?</p>
<p class="contents">I am not so sure. In Europe, there are still many millions of unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be preferable to find out how, possibly via re-training routes, these people could find employment?</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from this, I would question the legal basis of possible proposals by the Commission. I concur with the opinion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on this.</p>
<p class="contents">A final sensitive issue I should like to draw attention to is the prevention of migration flows of citizens from third countries within the European Union. If a European immigration policy is established, the work permit of those people, certainly in the first instance, will need to be linked with their presence in one country.

This was one of Parliament’s requests that has now become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly share two thoughts with you on the issues that are the subject of this debate: firstly, that the migratory movements toward Europe we are now seeing correspond to a mass exodus of citizens who, in their own countries, do not enjoy the minimum conditions necessary for survival and who are being tragically exploited by the organised mafias who traffic in them. This has already been discussed here in Parliament. The cases in Dover and on our own Andalusian coast are clear examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, illegal immigration of this nature is fertile ground for the social exclusion of this immigrant population and for the exploitation of their labour, in addition to the outbreaks of xenophobia and racism that are taking place in certain parts of Europe. This problem can only be resolved by close cooperation and collaboration with the countries of origin, otherwise, any policy in this field will be condemned to failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA, or the immigration and asylum action plans themselves are absolutely necessary. Yet at the same time, and I would like to put particular emphasis on this point, it must also be stressed, from a political angle in particular, that the countries of origin should make the most of their natural and human resources and, most of all, guarantee political and social stability so that their citizens can have confidence in their own leaders. This is, therefore, an issue of shared responsibility and not only the responsibility of the Member States or of the European Union itself. Countries such as Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia are an example of what I have just been referring to.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, with regard to the communication on the common asylum procedure, the main problem with which Member States are confronted is that of asylum seekers whose claims are unfounded. The Commission and this Parliament should, therefore, make a great effort to remove the major obstacles blocking the standardisation of solutions between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, it does not seem to be the right occasion to talk about a common procedure, distinct from the mandate contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam that refers to a common asylum procedure. It is not the same. Furthermore, both the communication and the Evans report fail to define concepts such as persecution by third parties, persecution in cases of conflict or gender related persecution, for example, given that the difficulty sometimes lies more in the definition of the concept of the refugee than in the process of identifying it.</p>
<p class="contents">To be precise, we are on the right track: faced with a phenomenon such as asylum and immigration, a concern for many of us, cooperation, solidarity, clear legislation and realism are the necessary prerequisites for addressing one of the major challenges for the European Union in this new century.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication on a Community immigration policy, and the vote on the Pirker report, give us an opportunity to do just that. In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino's statements.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that for Europeans the Tampere Summit in October 1999, which sought fair treatment for nationals of third countries in comparison with citizens of the Union, was a very important event. We must start from one important established fact, which we were reminded of just now: the myth of zero immigration can no longer be a realistic concept, and in any case demographic problems and labour shortages will have to make us change our ideas about immigration. This is why, today, we must give our strong support to the Commission’s communication, because this future Community policy on immigration has a great many virtues, in particular that of combating all forms of criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has adopted a rather critical position regarding the Commission’s communication. Unlike Mr Pirker, we socialists are convinced that our approach to this question must be a humane approach rather than an economic approach, because we are talking here about the fate of human beings, not about common merchandise.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember, and we can never remember it enough, that if people emigrate and suffer the pain of separation from their country and their loved ones, it is because they are obliged to do so. They are not simply doing it for pleasure. The Commission’s position is fundamental inasmuch as it proposes a framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by saying, in addition, that in a European Union which is constantly becoming more integrated, and which now has the benefit of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, no Member State can now claim that its policy on admission is nobody’s business but its own. I therefore reiterate my full and wholehearted support for the Commission’s proposal, at the same time taking a critical view of the content of Mr Pirker’s report. As far as I am concerned, I defer the vote of the French socialist delegation on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How is this to be interpreted?</p>
<p class="contents">A wave of Islamophobia is passing over Europe at present. In several EU countries, Muslims have been persecuted. The most rancorous debate I have been able to follow is taking place right now in Denmark. Quite a few politicians have made astounding statements. Mr Camre, a Member of this House, has said that all the countries of the Western world are being infiltrated by Muslims and that, while some of them are friendly enough with us, many of them are in favour of getting rid of us – in Danish, <span class="italic">få os fjernet</span> – that is to say, removing us. That is a prejudiced and irresponsible statement. My concern, as I address this House, is that the wording of Paragraph 15 might be in danger of creating further scope for this type of inflammatory statement. Is Europe not in danger of losing its diversity? Are we not in danger of tampering with freedom of religion and freedom of expression? Could not Paragraph 15 be understood as saying, ‘Adapt, full stop. Otherwise, gather your belongings together and go!’ I wonder if Mr Camre might respond to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would of course be marvellous if we were to use our cooperation to strengthen the principles we talk so much about – democracy and human rights and, I might add, humanitarianism – instead of dragging each other down to the lowest common denominator. I think there are quite a lot of good things in Mr Evans’s report. I intend to support it and shall call for a vote in favour of it. I think, however, that there are still a lot of problems with Mr Pirker’s report. It was improved quite considerably by the committee’s reading of it. It is also, of course, reasonable to hope that it will be further improved in the course of today when we vote on it. However, a lot more is required before I shall support the report, which is based principally upon the EU’s wanting to show solidarity with itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be unreasonable to think that it is merely a question of settling technical problems in the context of a generalised consensus, and I believe that these difficulties also demonstrate the urgent need to reach a consensus, at European level, on a certain number of essential measures.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I think that it would be unreasonable and irresponsible to deny the extent of clandestine immigration and the fact that it is getting worse. I believe that that would be unreasonable and politically tactless. It is therefore very important, in addition to having measures of a regulatory nature, to develop an active policy of combating trafficking in human beings, because such trafficking constitutes, above all, the exploitation of a great deal of misery, poverty and fear, by organisations which are highly efficient and who not only traffic in human beings but also engage in other criminal activities. For this reason, policing measures, and in particular the intensifying of border checks, are essential if we are to remain one step ahead and ensure that our future external borders will be protected. I would remind you that the largest police operation that has ever been undertaken in Europe is now underway, on our future external borders. Thirty countries are involved, from Finland to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure I do not need to tell the European Parliament that, to us, asylum is a sacred concept, that it constitutes the dignity of Europe, and that is why, throughout the world, Europe still acts as a beacon and an example. We cannot preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves. However, at the same time we cannot ignore the fact that this important value is being abused by a considerable number of people, who probably have, in human terms, legitimate reasons for doing so, but who do it to the detriment of those who are fleeing real persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a matter of urgency that we should first of all agree on the conditions for receiving would-be refugees into our territory, and not add still further to the attractive prospect which our prosperous and – though we tend to forget it – happy countries pose to those who know only wretchedness and poverty. We must therefore agree quickly on the rules for allowing people to come in, if we want to avoid the phenomenon of asylum shopping.</p>
<p class="contents">Asylum is, of course, a right, but is it necessary, in order to have legal guarantees, that things should be complicated, thereby allowing procedures to be dilatory and resulting in a situation in which, in some countries, even after four, five or six years no one has proved capable of taking a decision, so that it is necessary to take measures to regularise the situation? Respect for the law is not incompatible with rapid and effective procedures. These were the questions we raised at the last Council, and I was pleased to find that, among the Fifteen, there was a very broad consensus on the need to reach a consensus on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, we must define a certain number of rules at European level. I was going to say minimum rules, but I shall not do so because to some people that would mean ‘no improvement’. What I am trying to say is essential rules which do not necessarily go into matters in detail but which translate into practical terms the fundamental political consensus that there has to be on this subject if we are ever to succeed in overcoming this problem. We need to do this quickly, and that is why I said that we must, at the Laeken Summit, try to re-launch the European dynamic, because otherwise the outcome would be negative and not a true reflection of our opinions. We must also decide how much solidarity has to be agreed on at European level because the mere fact that one country happens to be situated at an external border should not mean that that country should necessarily have to bear the whole burden of any measures that are agreed on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that immigration is another problem, but it is also true that we cannot claim that if we had a more or less unrestricted immigration system all our problems would be solved; nowhere in the world is there any example of such a policy being implemented, and even where the system is the most liberal, it is still not possible to solve all the problems, especially those that are still linked to illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to ask a certain number of pertinent questions, and this is what we shall be doing at the conference which will be taking place in a few days’ time in Brussels. How is Europe’s population going to develop? Do we still have any requirements at economic level and if so, of what kind? Will the situation be the same everywhere? Does immigration have to be subject to conditions? Is it to be permanent or for a limited period? Should we demand a certain number of qualifications, risking savage consequences for the countries of origin, which often have a need for precisely those qualifications? Would there not be the risk of an increase in the number of unemployed people, at least in the long run, which would only make budgeting more difficult? If we want to find successful solutions to all these questions, we must have the courage to ask them clearly and to come up with some serious answers, and I hope that that is what will happen at our conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must tell you that the Belgian Presidency – we may be a small country but we are, I think, a realistic one – would like to draft proposals that bear the stamp of realism, because we believe that such realism is the only thing that will enable us to make the progress that is so essential. If we get lost in ideological or technical considerations, we shall still be debating the question fifteen years hence and we shall still not have made any significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is an enormous risk, because the people of Europe are waiting for some answers. They have confidence in Europe. They believe that this is a useful, perhaps even essential, dimension in the solving of such problems. If we do not succeed in finding answers for our people, I fear that there is a dangerous risk that they will take matters into their own hands, and I am also afraid – and I hope that we in this House share this feeling, at least most of us if not all – that Europe may not be able to remain a Europe of rights and freedoms, a Europe that is welcoming and open, and also, because this is what our fellow citizens are concerned about, a Europe that is prudent and takes precautions, and a Europe that expects all those who find themselves in its territory to respect the rule of law.</p>

We have been working – and I refer to this legislature, of course – over the past two years to establish positive relations between citizens and immigrants, to make equal opportunities possible and to create a form of social cohesion. Now, everyone can see the need to revise certain parts of the agenda we have been working on and, in particular, to identify how the revision of these points can be converted into positive Community legislation allowing us to grow into the kind of Europe we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make three points. Firstly, we need to focus more on defining framework legislation to promote actions at regional and local levels, always in agreement with the Member States, in situations where an initiative is certainly needed to make it easier to balance the three factors which have always been the basis for our analyses of the issue of immigration and asylum.<span class="bold"> </span>These factors are migration flows, which must be regulated and continuously monitored, integration, and the fight against illegal immigration which is often, sadly, a source of the more major concerns of crime and the exploitation of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a thorough debate at European level on the issues which we consider to be vital for our policies such as cooperation between police forces, judicial cooperation, common forms of control and common information systems. We must make it quite clear what financial resources we should consider adequate and quantifiable in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we may well have disregarded or underestimated the importance of one of our tasks. We must insist on the need for the major educational programmes which are the foundations of our culture, and of multiculturalism, in particular: there must be schooling and education starting with foreign children, especially, irrespective of their legal position. These programmes are fundamental for the policies of integrating and building the societies we want. In my opinion, we must establish a substantial educational and cultural programme, a major part of which promotes communication between cultures, for that would be the first step along a path which will certainly bring about the sort of integration we desire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you have listened seriously to the demands made by many experts on migration and NGOs and have made it clear in two communications how policy on refugees and traditional migrants is to be handled. With your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Your proposals will now help us to find some concrete solutions. The rapporteur, Mr Evans, has made a fine job of this. I regard the additions he proposes as enhancing the current debate on concrete directives. You have also succeeded, Commissioner, with your communication on a Community migration policy, in making it clear how important it is that future migration in the European Union should be jointly controlled and regulated throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we will probably have to carry on debating the wishes of the Nation States, which I take very seriously. They want to arrange the fine tuning of migration themselves, although their strategies have already been a failure at national level for decades. I trust that we will soon manage to persuade our colleagues at national level that there is no alternative to Union-wide control of migration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of this, it may have been more appropriate to postpone the discussion of these reports because they do not take into consideration recent international developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention should be devoted to the formulation of Paragraph 15 in the Pirker report. The present document emphasises that the Member States are obliged to respect the rights and duties of third-country nationals. In my opinion, this is a bridge too far.

It presents immigration as a simple problem of merchandise linked to the needs of the capitalist system. In effect, the report regards as positive the view that immigration should be envisaged from an economic viewpoint, as a function of the needs and capacities of Member States. Article 23 could not be clearer. Each Member State has the freedom to define the skills profile and number of workers required on the basis of the needs of its labour market. In other words, the proposed Community policy on immigration is a quota policy. By adopting such a position, Europe shows that it is still a long way from recognising the right to immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here is residence permits restricted by the requirements of the bosses and the fantasies of the demographers. Even the issue of keeping families together is going to be subject to different rules for each group of immigrants, which is the exact opposite of freedom of movement, freedom to select one’s place of business, and the right to live with one’s family.</p>
<p class="contents">Massively overexploited, immigrants are the victims of liberal deregulation. I shall end by saying that only the general regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants plus citizens’ rights will enable us to combat effectively the modern slavery which we are being invited to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This situation is the result of two separate factors: firstly, it has come about because the Treaty of Amsterdam granted new competences to the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale; and secondly, because there has been a considerable increase in migratory pressures from third countries, the devastating effects of which have been highlighted by certain recent tragic events, such as the massive influx of refugees from the Kosovo crisis and the tragedy at Dover.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary, for both humanitarian and economic reasons, to define a global policy that is able to effectively manage these migratory flows, which currently constitute a legal vacuum, to which the European Union cannot fail to provide a response. We must take account of the fact that three different types of people are involved in this problem: asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants. Although the symptoms are similar, it is important to distinguish the causes and find different answers. Confusing the status of these people does not help to solve the problems we are facing, and actually makes them worse. We also know that this external pressure adds to the internal pressure felt by States that are facing a decline in their own population, caused both by a slowdown of population growth and a reduction in the population of working age, with an increasing population of those over the age of 65. Concern is also growing about the sustainability of social security systems. The answer cannot be to make vain attempts at preventing and halting immigration at Europe’s borders. The answer lies, instead, in managing and freezing it at current levels. Hence the need for a carefully thought out, clear and coherent common European policy for the management of migratory flows. In order to prevent new problems emerging, we will have to consider the real labour needs of each Member State and the resources available for the reception and integration of these immigrants. It must be understood that we incline more to the approach advocated by Mr Pirker.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on his announcement today that, within a month, he will be presenting two initiatives on combating illegal immigration and on repatriation. Lastly, I wish to emphasise that we need to adopt a prudent approach to a sensitive issue that requires intelligent answers. It makes more sense, for example, for us to give priority to legalising immigrants who can be integrated into the labour market and who are already on Community territory than encouraging a new wave of immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many points of agreement between the Commission communication and the reports we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to develop a more proactive policy which recognises that pressure from migration is set to continue and that properly planned immigration can bring benefits to Europe, to the migrants themselves and also to their countries of origin. Our aim is to improve the management of migratory movements within the framework of close cooperation with countries of origin and of transit, strengthening the fight against illegal immigration and combating the criminal networks involved, guaranteeing, at the same time, the rights of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is a more open and flexible policy which, in addition to providing greater coordination of policies aimed at reducing migratory pressures and strengthening border controls, could have the benefit of achieving a reduction in illegal immigration that would be advantageous to those very people who truly need the protection that refuge and asylum affords. We should maintain these levels of protection at all costs, as envisaged in the Geneva Convention, for this is also a sign of European identity that fills us all with a sense of pride.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage Commissioner Vitorino to continue his good work and to keep to the timetable that has been fixed, and the Council to be equal to the position adopted at Laeken, thereby fulfilling the commitments made at Tampere. It is time to take practical decisions and not to make statements that are only balanced because of their ambiguity.

There are at least three different types of immigrants: political refugees, refugees from war zones and economic migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this distinction has been made, it immediately becomes clear that a single asylum law cannot cover all three categories, as Mr Evans proposes. Not only does this document fail to correspond to reality, it even goes so far as to demonise the Member States which demand the right to decide whether to recognise the right to asylum on a case-by-case basis, depending on the way the society of the country in question is structured and the adequacy of the reception facilities available, without incurring negative repercussions for anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Instinctively, all of us have always been supportive of those who find themselves in the dreadful situation of being forced to leave their own country and apply for asylum in another, but the level of danger to which the rapporteur would have it conceded that all applicants are exposed in their countries of origin is not always acceptable. He is compelling governments and Member States – to put it in colloquial terms – not to make a fuss and to open their gates without delay, invoking the Geneva Convention as if it were a magic password, a skeleton key, rather than what it actually is, a series of guarantees that place those seeking and those granting asylum on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans’ proposal to establish a common minimum standard – as he calls it – actually invalidates this principle by making it too permissive. The same may be said of the proposal to introduce a single procedure – as it is called – which, in practice, takes away from the host State any possibility of verifying the suitability of the applicant, who cannot be denied any right, mind you, and whose only obligation is to produce his credentials, as happens among respectable people.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that refugees and exiles often provide easy cover for decidedly undesirable guests such as drug dealers, traffickers in human beings and terrorists who pretend to be immigrants and then train as pilots and destroy skyscrapers and all the people working inside.</p>
<p class="contents">The caution and controls that the rapporteur is denying the States are the fundamental elements of basic, legitimate protection of the States and their citizens. The Pirker report, which I do support, on a common immigration policy, is much more responsible, not least because it is more balanced, does not make concessions to cheap populism and respects safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to those Members of the left who have attempted once again to bring up the usual controversy against Mr Berlusconi today, I would point out that they are at least a day late. They should read the <span class="italic">Arc-en-ciel</span>; although they have missed the debate, they are still on time for the train of cheap populism<span class="bold"> </span>and pointless political speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that there is no doubt at all that the two reports we have seen today prove that we need a common policy on migration and asylum. I should like, in passing, to pay tribute to the Commissioner’s statement and to all the work that Parliament has carried out, which shows that we attach real importance to these issues, particularly in the current circumstances. I believe that here today we have been able to make our different views clear, and perhaps we have also made clear the difference between asylum and economic migration. I am not sure, however, that we have entirely avoided confused thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of migratory flows and the right of asylum, we must make it clear, in the face of all opposition, that rights and obligations have to be shared, by both migrants and host Member States. We must not have a situation in which certain people can take advantage of the loopholes in our harmonisation in order to create an underclass of Europeans by introducing second-class workers or deferred citizenship. It seems to me to be important that the rights of workers, of whatever origin, should be asserted and given tangible expression in order to combat the trafficking in human beings, by which certain people exploit misery and distress.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our asylum policy, it will gain in terms of quality and justice if we can agree to recognise that it needs to be supplemented by other compulsory cooperation policies which enable everyone to live with dignity and self-respect in their own countries. In all cases, asylum policy should reject arbitrary criteria linked to the current situation. I should also like to ask, simply, that we should also give political rights to those whom we welcome for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Geneva Convention drafted in 1951 was conceived as a temporary measure. It was negotiated in a very different world – a world still haunted by the shameful failure of Western countries to offer sanctuary to the victims of European fascism. It was designed first and foremost to ensure that refugees from communist tyranny would have access to safe havens.</p>
<p class="contents">But the world has moved on. Mass air travel has facilitated unprecedented migratory flows. The great majority of those seeking better lives in new countries are actuated by understandable – indeed laudable – economic motives. But the terms of the 1951 Convention, and specifically the requirement to assess all claims individually, even if the applicant is manifestly coming from a safe country, encourage economic migrants to seek entry as refugees. This clogs the system to the disbenefit of those genuinely fleeing from injustice and wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I support, as Mr Pirker's report does, a degree of controlled primary immigration. All countries can benefit from the energy and enterprise of people who are prepared to cross whole continents in search of a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">For such a policy to gain public consent it must be fair and transparent and it must be open to account. It cannot be right for the judiciaries of our Members States, by applying a peculiar interpretation of the 1951 Convention, to operate an immigration policy beyond the control of elected politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to manage a sustainable policy of legal immigration and, at the same time, protect the rights of those most in need of sanctuary, we must take back control of our asylum laws from the judges. Far from enlarging the scope of the Geneva Convention, as Mr Evans suggests, we should scrap this outmoded accord and replace it with something more suited to the modern world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Greek islands are under pressure from an unprecedented influx of refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan. Greece is having to shoulder a burden which is out of proportion to what it can cope with, which is why the European Union urgently needs to take its share of the responsibility, in this specific case by helping Greece to draw up an integrated joint plan to protect the right of asylum and ensure that the Geneva Convention is fully applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the sacred right to asylum must not, under any circumstances, be undermined by the measures needed to combat international crime and terrorism.

As Deputy Mayor of the city of Lyon, I see this problem every day. In my city, the number of conventional asylum seekers has doubled in a little less than a year.</p>
<p class="contents">The two Commission communications that we are debating today are certainly an important step forward. However, we must go further and put an end to the current situation, in which some Member States allow in refugees coming from certain countries whereas others do not.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so. In recent times, however, those means have been reduced. We can no longer receive asylum seekers with dignity. In our cities we have families living under canvas. This is absolutely unacceptable. Winter is approaching and we are heading for a catastrophe. In order to make progress, however, I invite, above all, the governments of Member States and the Council to take the courageous decisions that are necessary. Insisting on maintaining positions which are too national will end up becoming indecent and irresponsible when the lives of thousands of refugees are at stake and when certain districts in our major European cities are at risk of turning into ghettos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I wish to thank you for all your contributions to this debate, including the critical contributions, and clarify two points of criticism I think are important. First: with regard to the comment by Mr Nassauer, the Commission has not abandoned the principle of the safe third country. It has not abandoned this principle at all and in fact we are working, in Council, on a definition of a safe third country and I am sure that, as Mr Nassauer said, Mr Schilly will continue to be as tough a negotiator on this matter as he always has been. With regard to the second aspect, I should like to remind you that the Commission has given itself the task of reviewing its proposals in light of the international situation that has arisen following the terrorist attacks in the United States of America. The review is now underway. We shall undertake this task with the utmost rigour and the results will be submitted to Parliament. The Commission does not take a positive view, however, of the implication that there is a link between terrorism and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has put forward proposals that respect rights and seek to manage migratory flows. There are also proposals on combating illegal immigration. Any attempt to portray the Commission<span class="italic"> </span>as having no initiatives on fighting illegal immigration is unfair. The proposal for a framework decision against trafficking in human beings adopted by the Council last week is a Commission proposal. The communication on illegal immigration, the communication on repatriation policy and the communication on the joint policing of borders have been on the ‘scoreboard’ since May 2000 and are part of the Commission’s work programme that was submitted for debate in this Parliament this year. These are not the result of emergency measures arising from the terrorist attacks; they are an integral part of this Commission’s coherent and consistent immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to thank Parliament for its support. I hope that, with the clear ideas that have emerged from this debate, the Laeken European Council will be able to take a step forwards. These measures provide added value at European level and I thank the European Parliament for its contribution.</p>
