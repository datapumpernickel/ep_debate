<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, we have before us the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the Commission communication on water management in developing countries and priorities for EU development cooperation, and on the establishment of an EU water fund, which the plenary is to vote on at noon tomorrow. In practice we are considering two related motions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to recall the situation in which a substantial minority of our fellow humans on this planet find themselves as regards access to water. In all, 1.7 billion people do not have access to drinking water. Three billion people have no access to sanitation. The number of people who die each day from diseases linked to a lack of drinking water and of sanitation is put at 30 000. Water is an essential natural resource for life, health, food and general well-being. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has enshrined access to water as a fundamental human right. The 145 countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have an obligation to ensure that everyone has access to water, equitably and without discrimination. The issue that is therefore becoming ever more pressing is this: what sort of cooperation policy is needed to help poor countries to meet the vital challenge of making drinking water available to everyone?</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1991, at the end of the World Water Decade, an international commitment was declared to provide safe drinking water for all by 2000. Two years after that deadline, it had to be recognised at Johannesburg in 2002 that this commitment was a long way from having been met, despite the efforts of the World Bank in particular. The situation could even be said to have deteriorated somewhat. A new, scaled-down objective was agreed at Johannesburg: to halve the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015. The European Union wishes to play an active part in achieving this objective and the Commission has set out its priorities in the communication before us.</p>
<p class="contents">In the motion for a resolution to be voted upon at noon tomorrow, the Committee on Development and Cooperation suggests that the following priorities should be adopted, aware as it is that it would scarcely be credible to continue along the path mapped out by the World Bank in 1993 in its report on Water Resources Management. It has in fact become apparent that the privatisation of water services in accordance with the ‘full cost recovery’ principle has generally led to an increase in charges, preventing the poorest communities in the poorest countries from having access to drinking water. This means that the solution identified in no way solves the problem, and if anything exacerbates it. We therefore think it is essential for water distribution to be regarded as a public service. The public-private partnership system may be one means of improving access to water, but it should not be viewed as a panacea.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that a pricing system should be adopted which allows everyone access to the water required to cover essential needs and ensures efficient use of water by giving users responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards management, the countries concerned have both the right and the duty to adopt a policy that clearly involves local populations in management.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Committee on Development and Cooperation believes that significant financial resources need to be devoted to achieving the necessary investment in the countries concerned, it welcomes the establishment of a European Water Fund. Nevertheless, it considers that the main aim of this fund should be to support the beneficiary countries' water policy, which should be based on democratic management and fair distribution. We therefore propose that the management of the fund should be based on an EU-ACP partnership. Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is of the view that the success of the fund depends on participation by its beneficiaries, who must be involved in the processes of design, implementation, monitoring and assessment, as well as in the management and control of the fund, as I have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it is important to devise new categories of financial instrument, based on international solidarity. The first thing that comes to mind here is to call for the ACP countries’ debt to be cancelled. The money thus released would allow these countries to fund basic water supply and purification infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like the Commission to study – and please note that I am saying ‘study’, we are not talking about a proposal as such – the scope for introducing a tax on bottled mineral water in the EU countries and in the relevant ACP countries, a very low tax, about half a euro cent, which would make an important contribution to the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to offer the various political groups my views about the amendments that have been tabled. Amendment No 1, tabled by the Socialist Group, complements the existing proposals very well, even if the report was adopted unanimously in committee. As regards Amendment No 2, which relates to recital L, I would prefer it if the Socialist Group would eliminate certain terms that weaken the text. I also find Amendment No 11, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, perfectly acceptable. Furthermore, I myself tabled Amendment No 5 on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and this amendment seems very important to me on the eve of the Cancún Summit: in line with what I have just said, my group invites the Commission to withdraw the demand, made in the context of the GATS Agreement, that water distribution and purification services should be liberalised. We regard this demand as running counter to the essential objective of providing access to water for all in poor countries. If it is adopted, this amendment will strengthen the European Parliament's political message. I therefore urge you to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank everyone, Members and Secretariat staff alike, because there have been a great many amendments and we managed to achieve an agreed position in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the eve of the Fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference, which is to be held in Cancún. In 1999, in the run up to Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, who will be negotiating on behalf of the 15 EU countries at Cancún, was given a specific mandate. However, the issues up for negotiation were different. I believe that the WTO now has enormous influence and that it has assumed too great a role, so much so that it almost seems to have become the new United Nations. In fact, this is just one of the reasons. I think that a new mandate is desirable, bearing in mind, not least, the objectives and commitments entered into by the European Union in different international forums.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Doha Round, which was called a development round, has not been followed up; in fact, the proportionality relationship between liberalisation and development has not been proven to be correct. Quite the opposite, in fact: indiscriminate liberalisation and deregulation in developing countries have, in practice, proved to be extremely damaging to development objectives. Even where liberalisation has led to an increase in GDP, the distribution of wealth within the countries concerned has very often deteriorated.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the report calls for regional integration between developing countries, and a model of symmetrical market opening, so that the developed countries can dismantle their barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, giving the countries of the southern hemisphere the time they need to step up their production, make it more competitive, and expand their markets. I also think it is important to remember, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, how much we, the countries of the northern hemisphere, have benefited historically from protectionism on the way to our present level of development.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, every now and again we are surprised by the fact that the Commission insists, for example, and despite the resolution adopted by this House on 3 July 2003, on embarking on negotiations on the Singapore Issues. I do not have time to list all those issues, but they include public procurement. I do not think it is appropriate to open negotiations on these issues. The reasons for this relate, on the one hand, to the competences and power of the WTO, and on the other hand to the problem that I have already mentioned, namely the developing countries' lack of negotiating capacity. Indeed, these same countries stress in their reports that they are not in a position to support further negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, in fact, that it is vital to tackle other issues and to give the special and differential treatment clause some real substance, by implementing a global system of guaranteed prices to support producers of commodities such as coffee and cotton. The issues that need to be dealt with in terms of development are achieving and promoting fair trade – something that is, in fact, being pioneered in civil society – and the provision of assistance to countries to enable them to diversify their production without creating enclaves in export sectors, by actually promoting the integration of those sectors with the rest of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that development objectives should, above all, be related to the well-being of the population. I therefore consider that the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement, which states that the agreement may and should be interpreted so as to preserve the right of the Member States to protect public health, should be implemented without delay and without resorting to agreements stipulating procedures that are so restrictive and bureaucratic as to be unworkable. This aspect was covered thoroughly in Mr Lannoye's report, and in my own report, I, too, have, for example, stressed that it is important for essential goods such as water not to be left to market forces alone and that the European Union should pursue a policy of public funding not only for water distribution, but also to bring about the democratisation of water management as regards the management of springs, rivers and basins.</p>
<p class="contents">Any discussion of development should include the issue of debt, which was not, in fact, covered in the Commission document, although I concede that it was not strictly relevant. Highly indebted countries have debt-servicing obligations that can siphon off as much as a quarter of the value of their exports. I believe that the EU should commit itself to cancelling developing countries' debt, whilst providing for mechanisms for monitoring how capital sums resulting from debt cancellation are invested, so as to ensure that the benefits are genuinely felt by the population at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the enactment of a code of conduct comprising ethical, social and environmental clauses intended for European undertakings that make direct investments. With regard to the negotiations to be held in Cancún, it must be pointed out that we need a democratic, transparent system within the WTO and sufficient negotiating capacity for all countries, which do not exist at present. These conditions are therefore virtually indispensable if we are to establish a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have a long road ahead of us. We must act so as to correct the enormous disparities that exist, which means that we need not unrestrained trade but, rather, trade designed to meet the social and economic needs of all the people on this earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the subject of water, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification is currently taking place in Havana and the Commission is represented there. The big problem is that the desert is expanding and tropical forests are in bad shape, threatened by greed and crime. We are trying to do something about that. This has an influence on the balance of water. Watershed management is directly influenced, micro- and macroclimates are changing and all this relates to the first of the two reports we are discussing tonight. Perhaps in some years from now the law of the jungle will sound more like a reference to a paradise lost, because the jungle is a symbol of unspoilt nature. But I am sure this is not what Mrs Morgantini wanted to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I am faced now with the problem of having to address two different subjects at the same time. I will start with Mrs Morgantini's motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It calls on the Commission to reduce its pressure on developing countries to indiscriminately liberalise and deregulate their markets. There is no such pressure. The Commission is collaborating with developing countries to help put in place a sound regulatory framework for the provision of basic services. I want to draw the attention of Parliament, and especially members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the communication on the reform of state-owned enterprises that we have pursued in the Commission. This is also extremely relevant to Mr Lannoye's report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are issuing this communication in order to have firmer ground in our battle against, amongst others, the World Bank and the IMF, concerning privatisation. If we talk about water and the conditionality of privatising the management of water resources, my reaction has been that for a country like Burkina Faso the national responsibility of the government there to manage water carefully and in the interests of its citizens is as important – or more important – a national priority for that country as the missile defence shield is for the government in Washington. That is the approach. This Commission has been able to make sure that Burkina Faso was not forced to privatise its national water company as a condition for the big Ziga dam project providing water for the capital. A project where the World Bank is one of a handful of big donors and partners, and where this was initially a condition from the Bank, it has been implemented without that condition being kept, or insisted upon by the Bank, because others – i.e. the Commission – stood behind the government of Burkina Faso in resisting this condition.</p>
<p class="contents">You will see in this communication a much more nuanced approach to this whole issue. However, when I hear Mrs Morgantini arguing that, as far as water is concerned we should move away from the commercial way of thinking – I say yes and no! What does 'commercial' mean? A private, commercial, short-term, profit-maximising philosophy is clearly detrimental to handling water in developing countries. But if by 'commercial' you mean that ends have to meet, that is, it has to have economic sustainability, then there is no way whatsoever of escaping that commitment. This is what makes things so extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Kinshasa now has more than seven million inhabitants, of which not many more than one million have access to sanitation or safe sewage treatment. Therefore, most of the population, not only in the big slums in the exploding mega-cities of the south, but also in the emerging middle class, does not have even near-normal sanitation. They get fresh water and pay for it by the litre, but it is almost impossible to organise the next phase in the cycle economically. It is too long-term and too expensive. The real picture is not that some water companies from the north are out for quick profits in the south. There are no quick profits. Therefore, the divisive image of the past round of the international water debate, especially among NGOs in Europe, has been wrong – it is easy to warn against the risk of undue profiteering from more donor-funded activity in the water sector – but this is not the real problem. The real problem is to attract long-term, humble, down-to-earth funding for the necessary investments. We are nowhere near achieving that. It is very similar to the problem of the health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Annual public health sector spending per capita in Sub-Saharan Africa is somewhere between one and six US dollars. You do not get very far with that kind of money. It is exactly the same proportion when we look at water and sanitation. In many ways it is easier to do what needs to be done in the rural villages. We know what to do there. It is not that difficult and our technology is quite overwhelming. With deep-bore holes or pipes for transportation, our ability as a donor is quite fantastic. However, I see a big problem in provincial towns and the big mega-cities of the south. That is where cholera and other problems sneak in as a collateral problem because of bad sanitation. Deciding on how to organise this takes much more than repeatedly mobilising well-established divisive images of private or public money.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also too easy to take a shortcut by cancelling all these countries' debts. Please be realistic. We are doing everything we can on that front. Only the genuine addition of real money from the pockets of taxpayers in the north will make a difference. That is the real battle. We won some rounds in that battle over the European contribution at the Monterrey Conference. That is where we are looking for more money for water and sanitation. This is why we urge Member States to accept our proposal to accelerate spending and to create a water facility to ensure that the money, which is still conditional for the 9th EDF – the EUR 1 billion that depends on performance – could be accepted and mobilised to accelerate our action on the water issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade, we are forced to be optimistic and constructive and to push for Europe to stay on a line of progressive constructivity from the WTO meeting in Cancún and the Doha development round. I am still somewhat optimistic. It has to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mrs Morgantini's report there should be a stronger reference to the work immediately in front of us and the challenge and the potential for our partners – especially our ACP partners – to do what is immediately possible by opening up more regional markets between them. Who will invest in producing paint or soap in Uganda if such products cannot be exported to neighbouring countries? We tried to find out what happened regarding mosquito nets. Why were no mosquito nets being produced in Africa? The answer was that, as there were 17% tariff barriers, they were imported from Hong Kong. Regional liberalisation is the name of the game and this is what we have on the table in the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations. Parliament should give more of a helping hand in this. We are taking the safe route. Whatever happens in the WTO, the Cotonou route is there and it would be highly beneficial for our ACP partners to engage strongly in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have cut across the themes. I look forward to listening to the next contributions and, as always, to engaging in dialogue with this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pampered Europeans are desperate for rain to replenish our rivers and reservoirs. Experts have calculated that it will take at least fourteen days of rain to restore our rivers and reservoirs to their normal levels. Fortunately, we still have enough clean water when we turn on the taps. The water supply in the EU is obviously secure, and, what is more, it is affordable for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">After this hot summer, we Europeans have some idea of what it means when we are told that three billion people around the world – i.e. more than one third of the global population – have no access to clean drinking water or sanitation. Admittedly, in the UN Millennium Declaration, 189 governments pledged to halve this figure by 2015, but at present, there is no prospect of this ambitious goal ever being achieved. Since 1990, water withdrawal has increased tenfold around the world. The largest consumer of water is agriculture, followed by industry, and only then by private households. The USA uses most water, consuming around 296 litres per person per day. Households in Germany and many other European countries, on the other hand, use only half this amount.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East and to some extent in Asia, but also in parts of Mexico and Africa, large sections of the population have less than 2.5 litres of water per person per day to meet their needs, and many people in the water-poor regions have even less than that. Almost 40% of the global population live in river catchments extending across more than two countries. Countries located upstream often exploit their natural advantages over the countries downstream. Today, we still have wars over oil; in the not too distant future, wars could break out over water as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the Middle East is explosive. Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians find it difficult to share the River Jordan. Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which lie on the Euphrates and Tigris, are trying to control the water from these two rivers. Conflict over freshwater seems inevitable, and so UNESCO has designated 2003 the International Year of Freshwater. The European Commission and the European Parliament are aware of the scarcity of water resources and the associated problems, which primarily include a fair system of water management. This is why the important issue of fair water management was put on the agenda. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working to ensure that water management is not exclusively a monopoly, either of the state or of major corporations operating on a global basis. A healthy mix of public and private sector involvement should ensure that the populations in those areas of the world that have water problems can be supplied with fresh water at affordable prices. We must not get to the stage where if you are rich, you have access to water, but if you are poor, you have no fresh water.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote this public-private water supply mix, the Group of the European People’s Party has tabled various amendments to the annual report on the Commission communication on water management in developing countries, and I would ask all Members of this House to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues Mr Corrie and Mr Wijkman for their excellent cooperation and also convey my gratitude to our assistants and staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this has been a rather low-key debate today, this report has been the subject of very intensive discussions among Members of this House in recent days and, indeed, in recent weeks, not only in the meeting rooms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious, after all, that a Commission communication on water management in developing countries will always trigger very heated and intensive debate. The previous speaker spoke in great depth about the sensitivity of water as an issue in every part of the world. The WTO Ministerial Conference, which is due to start within a matter of days in Cancún, naturally makes this debate even more topical; key issues in this context are, for example, the Commission’s demands for the liberalisation of public services – which of course includes water management – and the situation with regard to the developing countries’ freedom to decide for themselves in future how they supply these public services.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about water management in developing countries, it is obvious to me that the Commission, and the European Union, should be promoting sustainable water management. One reason why I think Mr Lannoye’s report is so good is that he focuses very directly, and also very critically, on the problems and obstacles standing in the way of sustainable water management. He mentions intensive farming, which is predominantly export-driven, structural adjustment programmes imposed on countries in the past, which have weakened their public services, and he mentions the setting of wrong priorities in project funding. I think that this is a very good signal to send out, and there are also very positive approaches in the Commission’s current policies which aim to avoid these pitfalls in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As my group’s shadow rapporteur, I am rather unhappy that we have not managed to achieve a unified position on Mr Lannoye’s Amendment No 5, which takes a very critical line on the GATS requirements, which are obviously in place, and the Commission’s calls for liberalisation. However, let me reassure the rapporteur right away that I am working hard to ensure that as many of my colleagues as possible support him in making this demand.</p>
<p class="contents">He mentioned that he proposes to make a slight alteration to one amendment by Mr van den Berg. I would ask Mr van den Berg to tell us about this himself. I cannot do that here. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his good work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should even like to shift the focus in some cases. For example, Liberals believe that fair trade, in particular, is one of the best ways of fighting poverty. Needless to say, this does not mean that we must impose our diktat on the developing countries. The WTO forums offer the opportunity, in joint consultation, of reaching agreements that are fair for all partners. We therefore expect Cancún to create better world trade conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that the developed countries certainly have to offer is knowledge. International companies have extensive know-how, which they can pass on to their partners in the developing countries. As my party has already highlighted in an amendment, contributing this know-how results in increased economic activity, which promotes a considerable diversification of products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also to be welcomed that many businesses commit to improving education and health infrastructures for the local population. This is with good reason. It is also in their interest to have a healthy and educated labour force, but this must be stimulated. I should specifically like to call for greater involvement of industry in development cooperation, provided this is done according to the normal criteria – in other words, wages must be reasonable and child labour must be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that too little attention is being paid to the trade options at regional level. There are quite a few sticking points there too. Water management is a perfect example of this. Worldwide, there are some 260 reservoirs that are shared by various countries. Over the past 50 years, some 1 800 conflicts, armed or not, as the case may be, have broken out over these. Mutual consultation and sound agreements could have prevented these. Access to drinking water and proper sanitary provisions are fundamental rights of the population. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">My group calls for sound cooperation between local and national governments and the private sector, and this is where the European Union must take the lead and have a highly stimulating effect. My group does object to the rapporteur pointing an accusatory finger at the World Bank and the IMF. We emphasise that the grant of aid to developing countries must be commensurate with the needs of the country in question, and have tabled amendments to this effect. Liberals believe that the condition for partnership must also apply to the water fund that Mr Prodi proposed. We deem participation of the countries concerned highly important. With regard to the previously mentioned water fund, I should like to repeat that the EP's lack of involvement in this proposal was a missed opportunity. We therefore demand full involvement in its implementation. After all, this is the best guarantee for democratic legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is undisputed that the EU spends substantial sums of money on development assistance and makes every effort to conclude a variety of partnership and cooperation agreements in the different regions of the world, for both sides’ benefit. What is also undisputed is that despite all these efforts, poverty in the world has increased, especially during the last decade, and there appears to be no imminent prospect of any change in this trend. This is especially worrying in light of the fact that this rising poverty is one of the sources of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has before it a number of reports covering extremely important aspects of development policy. What is at issue is no more and no less than the use of increasingly scarce global resources. Today, wars are still being fought over oil, as in the Gulf, but violent conflicts are already emerging on the horizon over water. The USA and other industrial powers declare those areas of the developing world where there is oil and gas and other strategically important resources to be part of their sphere of interest, which apparently even gives them the right to wage war, but it is primarily among the developing countries that water is a problem – either because the resources are inadequate or because access to water is denied.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still time to prevent the impending catastrophe with a careful strategy and targeted expenditure. Mr Lannoye’s report identifies possible constructive approaches which deserve to be given greater attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the health sector is no less precarious. Already, in some countries of the EU, the motto seems to be that if you are poor, you die earlier, because the reforms aim to establish a two-tier system, but the situation in the developing countries is far more acute. Millions of people in Africa are dying every year of diseases capable of being treated with drugs that have existed for years in the industrialised countries. The newly-negotiated WTO compromise on the import of cheap generic drugs comes too late, for a start, and, secondly, it is so hedged about with formalities that it has doubtful prospects of success. Mrs Morgantini’s report highlights problems concerning this aspect of trade in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and, indeed, the entire Committee on Development and Cooperation are seeking to bring their experience and authority to bear in order to combat growing poverty with all its manifestations and impacts. We expect the same and more from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The twenty-first century has only just begun, yet the signs point to storms ahead rather than peaceful co-existence based on solidarity. Development policy must be redefined with greater depth and scope, and a new approach is also needed if humankind is to have any chance of life and survival on earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also gives us an opportunity to adopt the reports before the WTO Ministerial Conference opens in Cancún, and I hope that Commissioner Lamy, who will be representing the EU next week, will oblige us by taking the reports into account as part of his negotiating mandate, especially as regards the key issue of preventing water privatisation. I am sure my friend Mr Lannoye will not hold it against me if I say I attach particular importance to Mrs Morgantini's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to help the developing countries to take advantage of trade. The question is, will the WTO's rules allow them to do that? I am not sure, given the disagreements that currently divide the developing countries and the western countries over the Singapore Issues, for example, that the European Union is best placed to support the position of the countries of the South, as it has its own interests to defend, the most striking examples being agriculture and fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Helping the developing countries to take advantage of trade first and foremost means changing the rules governing trade to make them more favourable to developing countries. The countries of the South were first encouraged to export commodities with low added value, only to have restrictions imposed on them, and they are now reeling from the impact of the fall in commodity prices and the problems in accessing markets in the countries of the North. As for the WTO, it does not so much regulate markets as liberalise trade. For example, the common market organisations for coffee and cotton and the price stabilisation systems for raw materials have at present simply disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, does helping countries really mean helping their populations? Do the hypothetical benefits of trade really go to the poorest people, or do they get no further than the top of the ladder in these countries? Promoting fair trade is still the only viable long-term strategy. On the one hand, we have to pay the producers in the countries of the South a fair price for their commodities; on the other hand, there is an urgent need to open up our markets to imports from developing countries and to abandon subsidies to our farmers. To that extent, the Cancún conference gives some room for optimism. I hope they will not be disappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only by changing and diversifying their production that the developing countries will really be able to establish their independence and play a key role in world trade. The Commission's efforts should be directed towards achieving that objective, and this is the issue that the Cancún conference should focus its work on. Helping developing countries to develop their trade above all means helping the populations of those countries to try to live a better life. Can trade be a means of ensuring a better life? I do not doubt that it can, but it is certainly not the only way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In terms of agricultural policy, for example, abolishing all market support and protection would remove about two-thirds of EU farmers from the land. This is in nobody's interests in either rural or urban areas. The current development round at the WTO is supposed to give special attention to the needs of developing countries and their desire to better integrate themselves into the global trading system. This is positive and should, in my view, be fully supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty per cent of the world's population lives in rural areas and the vast majority are in developing countries. It is worth noting, at the same time, that trade in agricultural products represented less than 6% of total global trade in 2000. Economic growth, in the initial stages, depends more on developing countries' internal markets than access to markets elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of agricultural trade liberalisation in Mexico should serve as a warning against the promotion of fully open markets as a solution for the needs of developing countries. Two decades of this policy in the North American Free Trade Area have led to an increase in rural poverty, malnutrition and emigration. It has also caused increased workloads in agriculture, particularly for women, and an increase in consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased profit and market control by multinationals has been at the expense of small family farms. If we add to this lost national revenues and damage to the environment and to biodiversity we see that Mexico's experience of seeking to develop its agricultural sector through trade liberalisation has had devastating consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of creating a fair trading system, the EU has made a significant contribution with its everything-but-arms initiative. We have committed ourselves to eliminating the customs duties applied to the exports of the world's 48 poorest countries. I should certainly hope that the Commission will be forcefully urging other rich countries to follow this lead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly I should like to consider the medicines for health crises in developing countries, for AIDS and malaria for example. Countries without a pharmaceuticals industry of their own are dependent on the import of cheap medicines. Last weekend’s agreement has been characterised as unworkable by health organisations because of the complicated import procedure. The European Union is therefore going to have to continue working for a simplification of this procedure in Cancún to ensure that in practice these countries do not remain reliant on expensive medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly we need to make trade in general fairer. Not by supporting fair trade financially, but through fair rules. In other words, standards not just for working conditions, but also for animal welfare and the environment. Working conditions, including child labour, merit more specific detail in the Commission document. These standards will only lead to fair trade if we help the developing countries to produce and to trade in accordance with them. For imports into the European market, in particular, to some extent similar standards must be employed to prevent an improper difference in competitive conditions. This will also encourage other countries to increase the quality of their products and production methods. After all protectionism is not the purpose of standardisation, as many developing countries fear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the low prices of raw materials and agricultural products constitute an impediment to development in many countries. Overcapacity is leading to extreme difficulties in a number of sectors, such as the coffee sector. The rapporteur rightly says that Europe must make an effort to bring about a trend towards higher prices for these products. Restricting production is a useful tool in this regard and must be recognised as such by Europe in Cancún. Free trade is after all not the solution for these problems. Both the Commission document and the report recognise this and consequently deserve our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like you, Mr President, to count to ten. When you end that count, 80 people in the world will have died of starvation. Every second, eight people die of malnutrition. What is it that these people can do to make all of us better off? The only thing they know they can do is to grow more food. But the one thing we prevent them from doing is to grow food that they can export to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we want to protect our cows and our farmers and our industry, we give more money to a cow each day than 600 million people have to live on. We give two dollars a day to a cow. The poorest people in this world have to live on one dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cancún we can make a difference. When I came to this Parliament from the British House of Commons, I came with great expectations. I came with the expectations that the European Union meant what it said. I came with the expectation that the Doha Round was a development round. I came with the expectation that the Commissioner sitting there would have a spine to go and fight, that Mr Lamy, who had introduced 'Everything But Arms', would go and fight. Well, I want to see them fight. Because if they do not fight, what are their lives about? What are our lives about? What is all this about when we know that now, for the first time in our history, we can make a direct link between poverty and the propagation of terrorism?</p>
<p class="contents">We must understand that link and we must start doing something about it. I come from a very privileged background in Sri Lanka, and I know people here come from very privileged backgrounds around the world. We must understand that link and have the spine and the courage to fight to allow people – who can do things such as grow and market their food and create rural agriculture in the developing world – to export produce. We should stop protecting our cows and our farmers in Europe inefficiently, and stop destroying our own customer base. Unless we are able to do that, we are going to have to pick up a huge bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about whether trade and development run in one direction. Often there are no unequivocal conclusions about whether or not that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would argue, as I am sure many speakers in the debate would argue, that trade liberalisation is not a panacea for generating the kind of self-sustaining growth and poverty reduction that we want to see as a result of our policies – we are talking about coherence here – let alone the objective that we have of promoting human development.</p>
<p class="contents">If developing countries are to benefit from trade then the first thing that has to happen, as the report makes very clear, is that developing country producers have to get a fair price for what they produce for their exports, and that those prices reflect the value of their exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the 1970s deteriorating trade terms have cost developing countries a great deal. Many ACP countries have lost more than seven times the amount they get in development aid. For them, as the Commissioner knows, the central problem is the shortage of competitively-priced exports. But in cases where export capacity exists, in countries like South Africa, Mauritius, Ghana, Botswana and certain Caribbean countries, then one does see export growth as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">But they also insist – and this is the case not just with Cancún, which most people will talk about, but in the EPA negotiations – that duty-free access to EU markets is simply not a sufficient spur to increase exports. They are aware, as we are, of the importance of addressing supply-side constraints, the need for adjustments and the need to meet the associated costs for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to understand – and I want to make a strong case for this – that capacity constraints are an essential part of how we deal with the ability of developing countries to tackle the trade issues that they face at this time, in bilateral, regional, and multilateral negotiations. They have a huge number of negotiations to deal with. Again, Commissioner Nielson is as aware of this, as am I, insofar as ACP countries are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of these negotiations there is a substantial and obvious imbalance between the parties negotiating in terms of economic size, political power and the sheer capacity to deal with the issue. I saw that insofar as the South African negotiations were concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural subsidies have an enormous, crushing effect on developing country producers and markets. I hope that at Cancún, although Commissioner Lamy denies that it is a central issue, we will realise that for developing countries it certainly is.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a long way from achieving the millennium development goals. Two years after the declaration of a Doha development round, next week in Cancún we have an opportunity to make globalisation work for the many rather than the few. I am sure you will agree with me, Commissioner, that we cannot afford to fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best way of doing this is generalised free trade, which offers the best guarantees for sustainable economic growth in all parts of the world. It is certainly the case that the liberalisation of trade is the key to development, but it also needs an important nuance.</p>
<p class="contents">I argue for the free market, not the unbridled or unlimited free market. <span class="italic">The</span> free market does not actually exist any more. Today we talk of a socially corrected market with attention to social standards, the environment, consumer protection, respect for intellectual rights, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">These constraints must be a permanent factor in the inclusion of less developed countries in the world trade system. In the next WTO round, we from Europe must certainly see the developing countries as our partners rather than as our opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share the view of the rapporteur, Mrs Morgantini when she says that there is no evidence of liberalisation stimulating the growth of prosperity. Globalisation offers benefits to all countries that engage in the world economy. Similar countries that have pursued a different trade strategy demonstrate marked differences in the area of per capita income. I am thinking for example of South Korea compared with North Korea, of East Germany compared with West Germany before unification. I am thinking of the Asian tigers compared with the Southern Asian countries. Or even more blatantly, about 20 years ago China and Africa were at the same level of development. Since China has resolutely pursued the path of an open economy and has engaged in the world trade system, the results have been spectacular. On average, the Chinese today earn three times as much as the Africans. The difference is enormous not just where income levels, but also knowledge levels are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">The rich may well have grown richer as a result of globalisation, but any question of the poor growing poorer is manifestly untrue. UN figures prove it. The proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty has fallen in 10 years from 29% to 23%. At the end of the nineties, there were 826 million people undernourished, or 40 million fewer than in the early nineties, despite the population explosion. The infant mortality rate fell worldwide from 64 per 1 000 in 1980 to 56 per 1 000 in the nineties. Around 80% of people in the developing countries have access to good water supplies, and illiteracy has fallen to 20%. That is not perfect, but things are moving in the right direction. There is still much to be done, but there is also hope. Proper globalisation is <span class="italic">the </span>way ...</p>

<p class="contents">What sort of a society is it in which nearly a third of humankind does not even have access to that most basic commodity, drinking water? Millions of people in poor countries die every year if not of thirst then at least from the many diseases spread by contaminated water. Is it because there are insurmountable technical obstacles to providing all the inhabitants of our planet with drinking water? No. Everyone knows that it is quite simply about money. Everyone also knows that twenty-first century society has accumulated more than enough material and financial resources to provide this. But water itself and its distribution have become a colossal source of profits for the multinational conglomerates. These conglomerates – Vivendi, the former Société Générale des Eaux, Suez, Bouygues – are free to raise water prices while international institutions vote through resolutions and prepare the ground for them by systematically dismantling public water services in poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Their profit is dirty money, contaminated by the blood of the millions of people who die of dysentery, cholera, typhus, malaria and bilharzia. In 10 years, the number of human beings without drinking water has risen from 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion.

I certainly hope that the countries participating in these negotiations – including the European Union and the United States of America – come to an agreement on one very sensitive issue. There are 42 million people in the world who are sufferers of the AIDS virus – many of whom are based in Africa – yet the technology and the treatment is available to combat diseases such as AIDS. If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms, then the costs of these medicines would be substantially reduced. There is now a growing political will to introduce changes to the international intellectual property rights system so that drugs to combat AIDS can be given to those countries which do not have the money to pay for them.</p>

I wish to take this opportunity of supplementing Mr Lannoye’s criticisms with further arguments, to the effect that privatisation also weakens the protection of precious water resources. In Denmark, the supply of water is based upon a principle of solidarity when it comes to prices and the accessibility of resources. In Denmark, the supply of water services is decentralised, primarily public and to a lesser extent private, but it is always user/owner controlled. That is a very important factor for ensuring the continued protection of sources of water. The public dimension of the Danish water supply services is very active in demanding as high levels of protection as possible and in demanding an end to possible sources of pollution. The private dimension is, however, very satisfied with the diluted requirements that the EU is now coming up with and that mean a weakening of the limit values for pesticides in our drinking water.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience in Great Britain and elsewhere also shows that, when the water supply is turned into a commodity and privatised, there is no more protection of resources. At the time when the EU was negotiating in connection with the Drinking Water Directive, London’s private water suppliers were thus lobbied on the same basis as the European chemical industry with a view to our simply allowing large quantities of pesticides into the drinking water. It was easier to earn money that way.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the only sure way to protect sources is not to use pesticides. I am therefore very pleased that, in its conclusion, Mr Lannoye’s report has, as its priority, the need to introduce production methods, in both the north and the south, that promote environmentally friendly agriculture, based to a significant degree upon local resources, green technologies and regional cooperatives. I am delighted to vote in favour of Mr Lannoye’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that in many areas there has been failure, not least in the commitment to ensure that everyone would have access to clean water by the year 2000. In 10 years the number of those suffering from a shortage of clean water has instead increased by half a billion, the number at present being approximately 1.7 billion. One in four people in the world drinks dirty water.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is compelling decision-makers to take a serious look at whether the measures taken have been at all the right ones. Universal, equitable and non-discriminatory access to clean water is a basic human right. A shortage of water is a self-evident cause of the spiral of poverty. Experience has shown that it is impossible to leave the problem of water shortages to the market to resolve. The invisible hand of the market is hardly likely to hand a glass of water to someone who is thirsty. We also have to recognise the fact that privatisation normally means higher prices for water and purification services, which naturally cause the greatest problems for the poorest people.</p>
<p class="contents">Because access to water has been established as a basic right it should affect the way we think about it. Water resources should not be seen as one country’s private property, but as a shared global resource. It must be said, however, that if water is treated as a free commodity to be shared, it weakens the potential for organising a highly functional water supply. For that reason, the flexible practices called for in the amendments in order to mix the public with the private are needed, as long as a person’s right to water is considered to be something basic that can never be given up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye’s report intelligently highlights the connection between access to water and purification and hygiene. Around 6 000 people, mainly children, die each day of infectious diseases, often caused by poor hygiene. It would be a fundamental error to view water, sanitation and hygiene as separate issues. Now, more than anything, we should increase those domestic and international resources that can be used to improve the water supply and sanitation in city slums and shanty villages as well as in rural areas. Of key importance is linking sanitation with the water supply, which will not succeed if there is no substantial additional investment on the part of those responsible for the water supply. We must, moreover, develop people-oriented technology for households as a solution to water and water purification problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to express my support for Amendment No 19, which requests the application of a water-debt trade-off, so that debts can be cancelled and the money used to fund basic water purification infrastructures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that we will be represented at the WTO conference in Cancún next week, I would first like to mention the connection with the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union should make its attitude clearer. If we consider – and that seems very much what you were advocating, Commissioner – that water is a public good, then we should ensure that the public authorities keep control of water distribution in each and every country. Of course, public-private partnerships can be used for funding. But you yourself quoted the comparison – a rather daring one, it has to be said – with what other countries regard as vital. Take anti-missile defence in the United States, for example. No one could imagine suggesting to the United States that they should subject their anti-missile defence to the authority of a WTO dispute resolution body, with rules such as national treatment, most-favoured nation rules, or the obligation to award a contract to any other WTO country if it responds to an open invitation to tender in this crucial area.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to water, if we take your comparison further, developing countries, such as Burkina Faso for example, even if they have access to investors, to multinational companies, should very much retain control over the way in which those investors are involved. I therefore believe that in the context of GATS – and I hope that the Commissioner responsible for development will have a decisive influence on those discussions, and that those discussions will not just relate to trade policy – we should not put pressure on these countries to liberalise their public services, in particular those relating to water, as a <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> for giving them access to our markets, such as the agriculture market.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to financing, we certainly need a European fund, but I support Mr Lannoye's comments. As in the case of the European Structural Funds, we know that creating a market is not the same thing as creating a community. Sometimes we have to support measures designed to make up for delays in development, which means that public finance is essential. A European fund is vital. We should even establish a world water fund, in the same way that UNAIDS exists at world level to treat persons suffering from AIDS. Private finance alone will not be enough to achieve this, and we cannot be content just to indulge in engineering. This will also mean increasing public funding. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mrs Morgantini's report on the link between trade and development, I would say that even if everyone agrees that trade can contribute to development, it is still not enough just to open up borders – as some speakers including Mr De Clercq have suggested – as if that automatically gave the key to development. Economic diversification is crucial. We should draw more inspiration from what we have done ourselves. Over a period, in a pragmatic and gradual way and by means of sectoral aid, we have to accept that the countries of the South can protect their own economies. Encouraging them to create markets on the huge scale required is essentially the objective of regional integration. But we should not adopt a systematic, dogmatic, one-size-fits-all approach to liberalisation, because that would exacerbate the deterioration in the terms of trade mentioned by Mrs Kinnock. These countries will of course export in greater volumes and Mr Deva is right to say that we should increase their agricultural products' access to the EU market, and we should reduce our subsidies to limit the effects of market distortion. They will, however, always be exporting products with ever lower value on the world market. These countries should be in a position to export more diversified, sophisticated and industrialised products. We therefore need to revise our trade policy towards developing countries, by giving priority to the aspirations and objectives of trade policy and to those of the Commissioner responsible for development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that the report issued by the Commission on water does not go far enough and perhaps avoids some of the most important structural issues and fundamental problems which we are going to have and which we already have in relation to water.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that the debate goes much further than privatisation or liberalisation. Europe is accustomed to providing general solutions, to laying down directives on everything relating to the European Union. I believe, furthermore, that we must fully accept that sustainable development must be approached in a made-to-measure fashion, that the problems are not the same in one place as they are in another and, therefore, we must, from the outset, establish flexible and open policies which allow for thousands of different solutions, hundreds of thousands of small projects, appropriate for the place in question. We must, moreover, introduce this philosophy into the investment criteria and the aid criteria amongst other things, because without local efforts and this adaptation of programmes to local projects we will not get anywhere. I therefore advocate this notion of flexibility, adaptability and numerous small projects, despite the fact that there are broad problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, on the subject of the framework concept, there is another issue which I would like to comment on. If water is a universal resource, as necessary and indispensable as the air or the earth, it is also limited and, take note, ladies and gentlemen, it is a transportable resource, unlike the earth. It therefore requires protection and regulation not only by states, but also at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a resource which must be shared. Just as the great rivers are shared and enjoyed by peoples of different languages, religions and nationalities, it is a cross-border resource and therefore requires international agreements and conventions for the sake of justice and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">As a universal resource, Europe must propose an international agreement, a convention which will allow rivers to be organised in accordance with river basins, as stated in the Directive on water, preventing a particular country from having the right to intervene in a manner which, as in the case of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaves other nations in precarious situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must take decisions as well, and talk about the fact that water, being a universal resource, cannot belong only to those who live at the heads of river basins or the peoples who wish to use them along the length of their course; we must discuss the possibility of creating diversions without harming anybody, in order to resolve the problems of desertification and water stress; in order to resolve the problem of the development of peoples living at the mouths of rivers or along their course.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are legal issues of great importance which Europe should promote and we should also introduce the concept of flexibility, sustainability and made-to-measure actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I am sure you have seen it, that Oxfam cow, to which we are currently giving shelter in our Parliament. For us Europeans, this cow is of course a symbol of affluence. But let us be realistic, for people in the developing countries this cow stands for unfair world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a good reason for Oxfam campaigning under the slogan ‘Make trade fair, stop the dumping’. I cannot repeat it often enough, and Mr Deva has also used the example: for a fifth of the poorest people in the world, the amount that this European cow receives in subsidy per day is more than they have to live on each day. In point of fact, the aim of our social democratic input at the WTO negotiations in Cancún next week is to come closer to genuinely fair world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Morgantini’s report on aid and trade therefore comes at the right time. It also clearly chooses the side of the developing countries. Unambiguously, the rapporteur stresses that, two years ago, clear agreements were made in Doha, but that there are difficulties in following them and observing them. First and foremost, it is the rich north – we may well look a little longer at the United States – that has been in default. In June, also in Europe as a party to the treaty, we just in time reached an agreement on the reform of European agriculture. This weekend we were finally able to reach an agreement, a huge breakthrough, on cheap medicines, following very strong resistance from the United States. It was at the last minute, but it was undoubtedly a huge breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from agriculture and medicines, the core of the Doha negotiations, the trade in services will also be on the agenda in Cancún. In his report Mr Lannoye takes a closer look at one of these services, that is the supply of water. His argument is that water is public property. I would say water production in particular, that is what my group actually supports. Water production must therefore stay in government hands, but for many developing countries private capital is needed for water distribution. The Commissioner has explained this. That does not mean that it must not happen under the control of the government, which is responsible for access and pricing. But 1.7 billion people have no access to clean drinking water and as many as three billion have no access to sanitary facilities. There is a compelling need for a good policy in this regard. Social democrats are in favour of public services remaining in government hands, a public responsibility of government control. But that does not mean that the private sector does not have an important part to play in parts of water distribution. This is the essence of the debate and here we agree with what the Commissioners said. In my group, as my colleague has already said, there are different thoughts about this.</p>
<p class="contents">A second product that warrants special attention in the light of trade and development, and which is often overlooked in the discussion of agriculture, is cotton. Four West African countries have called on the WTO to recognise the strategic importance of cotton for development, combating poverty, and food security in Western and Central Africa. Ten million people are directly dependent on the production and export of cotton. Their development is being hindered by trade barriers in the cotton sector, as a result of which prices are being kept artificially low. Our plea is that, in Doha, we should take measures concerning products such as sugar and cotton. We are also sure that the Commission can take action in this direction. Then we will have fair trade. More trade therefore means more success for the poor countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is only one answer: water. Not democracy. Not human rights. Not medicines. Nothing else, just water.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union has allocated EUR one billion for water aid – and I believe Commissioner Nielson has been instrumental in this – I must congratulate the EU and the Commissioner. What a fantastic job. This is what these people need. Sadly, it is not enough. We need to do more and I ask the Commissioner to please make sure that this Parliament has a say in formulating water aid policy so that it is not lost in the clouds like the EDF. Parliament needs to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I want this to happen. I hope you will assure us of this because I do not want my colleague here to persuade the PPE-DE Group to vote against the Lannoye report tomorrow. I understand what you are doing and I have confidence in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a quick word about trade. The poor countries need to process their products, not simply to export the raw products so that the value added is not received by them. That is the key to trade. I know Commissioner Nielson understands this and I know he is working for it. I hope he will do more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not difficult to understand. The money we are talking about is part of the EDF. We are working to set the budget for the EDF. The Commission and Parliament are in full agreement on this, also for very principled reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a special facility or fund in order to have a more flexible instrument, more ability to work across the board. There is no reason for the worry expressed in the report by Mr Lannoye about the 0.3% management of the fund. This is not an attempt to create one solution. It is more like a facility. It does not matter if we use the word 'fund'. The main idea is to be able to accelerate actions as necessary and to be a catalyst for the various partnerships that it is possible to create and promote. We are not talking about a conventional method of funding projects, but something that could accelerate things.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this debate and the welcome support from Parliament will make it possible for Member States to accept what we have proposed. To be direct, this is about eliminating the risk of losing EUR 1 billion of the EUR 13.5 billion reserved in the 9th European Development Fund which is up for evaluation next year. That money was made conditional some years ago, under the Cotonou Agreement and the 9th EDF, on the performance in the first part of the period. This is a totally political judgement. This is why we came up with the idea of reserving this money for the Water Initiative, in order to make sure that we all agree on this high-priority dossier and reserve the money for it so as to more or less lift this EUR 1 billion out of the general discussion. That is what we are trying to do. I hope that support from Parliament on this will muster enthusiasm among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the trade aspect of the discussion, I agree with Mr Belder about the very difficult situation in terms of coffee. It is ironic that we urged developing countries to diversify and pointed out that coffee was a good cash crop. The result is that now, Vietnam and many other developing countries are quite successfully moving into coffee production, consequently dumping it on the market, and damaging the market to such an extent that we have a crisis that is very difficult to deal with. There is no easy answer to that. The reality of the market is here to stay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
