<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, the Democratic Republic of Congo is a country that demonstrates the importance of the EU engagement being long term, if it is to be productive, and where – over time – we can make a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus my remarks on two issues: the democratic follow-up after the November 2011 elections and the security and humanitarian situation in eastern Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The DRC is a fragile state and a very young democracy. It is still recovering from years of war and deprivation. The road to recovery and stabilisation is not straightforward, but we are determined to persevere in supporting the DRC in consolidating its democracy and accelerating its development.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2006 elections were a milestone in their progress towards a more democratic future, but were achieved with huge support from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2011 elections, by contrast, were primarily funded and organised by the DRC itself. The challenges remained great, the execution may not have been perfect, but this is an achievement that we should recognise. We continue to provide support for the electoral process through a contribution of EUR 47.5 million and by sending an EU electoral observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the commitment and hard work of that mission, led by honourable Member Mariya Nedelcheva. They carried out the work in extremely difficult circumstances and a final report has been well received by everyone in the DRC. They highlighted the fact that the scale of irregularities and fraud weakened, if not undermined, the credibility of the outcome, and that there was a need for significant reforms and improvements in the future. Nevertheless, in present circumstances, all stakeholders have recognised that it would be impossible to recount the votes or organise a new round of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">So, our priority is to follow up the valuable recommendations for future reforms that are in the report. This will be an important element of our dialogue between the EU and the DRC Government. In the short term, we expect to see significant improvements for the provincial and local elections that will follow in the coming years. Therefore, we want to engage more closely with the government to ensure that we improve the democratic process and the country’s governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am encouraged by the recent appointment of Mr Ponyo Matata as Prime Minister and the new ministers that will work with him. He has worked closely with the EU in the past and he has a good record as finance minister of the previous government and as a national authorising officer of the European Development Fund. The commitments he made in his inaugural speech are particularly encouraging and they open the prospect for a political dialogue and progress in improved governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Head of Delegation has already met several ministers of the new government and is beginning to work closely with them. Initial impressions are very positive. But, of course, we want action, not just commitments. We have significant development assistance, which we want to use and we want to use it as productively as possible in facing the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, over the past three years, the situation in the eastern Congo has improved. But it is still extremely fragile and, as recent events have shown, there remains a risk of sliding back into war and disorder. Our priority is to work together with our international partners and with the governments of the region to try and prevent this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The mutiny by some elements in the Congolese armed forces – effectively, former rebels returning to the bush – has caused renewed fighting in the Kivus. I am appalled by, and strongly condemn, the recent mass killings by several armed groups.</p>
<p class="contents">One consequence of this has been a sharp increase in the number of internally displaced people in the last few months. We now have over two million people. Our humanitarian assistance already amounts to EUR 63 million in this year but, clearly, the humanitarian crisis is not over.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committed to the unity and sovereignty of the DRC. We condemn the rebellion and strongly support the restoration of the authority of the state, and that needs to take into account the legitimate concerns of the DRC’s neighbours. In that context, I am worried about recent reports of developments that might put at risk the positive regional dynamic between the DRC and Rwanda, and weaken their cooperation. That has been so important to underpin the progress in eastern Congo in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear messages have been passed to all in order to encourage a constructive approach in these circumstances, and we recall the need for all illegal armed groups to lay down their weapons and avoid further violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation is essential, too, to tackle a number of the problems of the Great Lakes region, including the illegal exploitation of natural resources – conflict minerals – and the provision of improved energy supplies for all.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the activities of MONUSCO in the DRC and we welcome the renewal of their mandate at the end of June. The protection of civilians in the east will remain an important mission for them in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">But there will be no sustainable peace without the rule of law and the application of justice. This is why I welcome and support the arrest warrant launched by the prosecutor against General Ntaganda. This is a clear sign that impunity will not prevail and, I hope, sends a signal of hope for the people who are suffering at the hands of the armed groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Our contribution to the reconstruction of the judicial system is an integral part of the wider campaign against gender-based violence in the DRC. Everyone should know that these crimes can and will be punished. But our programme aims equally to tackle the root causes as well as the symptoms of this problem. We have supported action to keep the DRC on the agenda of the Human Rights Council and to encourage the government to cooperate with that council.</p>
<p class="contents">Security sector reform, too, continues to be crucial. We are contributing through the operation of two missions: EUSEC, which supports military restructuring, and EUPOL, helping to reform the police. I look forward to continuing to contribute to it through the most appropriate instruments, taking into account the UN’s peacekeeping mission’s future mandate. But we can only have success on security sector reform with the commitment of the DRC at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to reiterate that the EU is committed for the long term to supporting the DRC and the Great Lakes region to escape the conflicts of the past and build a sustainable, more prosperous and peaceful future. It is the people of the DRC we are determined to help, and to do so through a comprehensive approach that tackles the many interlinked problems that they face.</p>

<p class="contents">Before I begin, I would again like to pay tribute to the Congolese people, who mobilised on a massive scale for the presidential and legislative elections in November 2011, thereby proving to the entire international community and to their authorities how committed they are to building a true democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Election Observation Mission, which I had the honour of heading, presented its final report on 29 March this year. One of the responses from the Congolese authorities was to declare that the EU was ‘only pushing an open door’. I assume, therefore, that it is thanks to these ‘open doors’ that the EU mission managed to observe the irregularities and violence which, unfortunately, characterised a large part of this election. However, the recommendations that we have now made involve fundamental reforms. They are feasible and coherent. They need to be put in place, and in the shortest time possible, because the issue is not only that the elections take place, but, more importantly, that they take place under the right conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, we must contemplate restructuring the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Congolese citizens deserve an independent INEC that observes the electoral timetable and complies with electoral law, that manages the election budget with complete transparency, and that respects all the parties involved in the electoral process. The establishment of a Constitutional Court and the transparent management of election disputes would greatly increase the citizens’ confidence in their own institutions, just like ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of political dialogue that includes all political parties and civil society, and that serves as the basis for responsible behaviour by all, is needed to finally work towards the country’s democratic, economic and social development. Respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, tackling the Impunity Law and ensuring the safety of all are challenges yet to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must carry on shouldering responsibility and focus particularly on monitoring. It is important that the Congolese authorities and citizens know they can count on us, yet at the same time, we must stand firm in our stance.</p>

Despite the fact that we are doing so due to the recently held elections there, we must condemn the fresh period of violence that followed the elections and the barbaric violence that continues in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence and human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo must be strongly condemned by the European Union. This violence, the victims of which are always the most vulnerable – women and children – should incite anger in us. Therefore, Baroness, I ask for the fight against impunity to be one of the priorities in our cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo. This fight requires major reforms in the country’s justice system, in the training of judges and in victim support, as well as initiatives aimed at a national reconciliation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the need for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes for former fighters to be kept up, as otherwise we shall not be dealing with many of the deep-rooted causes of the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, the final report of the EU Electoral Observation Mission contains a good number of valuable contributions that will promote transparency and the consolidation of democracy in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention, Baroness Ashton, to the fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission, which has been harshly criticised, received financial support from the European Union. For this reason, I ask that efforts be redoubled in order to prevent sectors and programmes that receive EU support from being able to act at their own discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by stressing the synergetic relationship that exists between development, the protection of human rights and the consolidation of peace and security. The Democratic Republic of Congo is no exception to this. We must continue to work on all three fronts if we want to make progress in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, despite this delay, the abuses observed in the running of institutions and in the electoral process are of continuing relevance and require a response on our part to prevent a similar situation from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">The first test of credibility, in the short-term, will be the provincial, urban, municipal and local elections, to be held between now and 2014. This agenda for these elections was defined and confirmed on 6 June 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament calls on the European Union to link the funding of future electoral processes with the effective implementation of recommendations as defined by the EU election observation missions. We need to stand even firmer in this demand given that the 2011 elections took place in a much less satisfactory way than the previous elections, to say the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">This is unfortunate in many respects and especially given that Congolese citizens are truly willing to become more involved in the democratisation of their country. The country is regressing while its citizens want to take part in its recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">If things remain as they are, Congo, despite making a promising start in the context of transition, would lag behind considerably when it needs to be injecting a new impetus. Many African countries have already shown that democratisation can work. Therefore, the situation in Congo is not an African inevitability, but rather a refusal or an inability to make the most of the assets that this country has. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for what you have just said, I would like to make three specific proposals for our long-term commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the infamous case of the assassination of Mr Chebeya, a human rights activist. I think this case absolutely needs to be appealed. I think we need to clarify whether or not the police were involved and I believe that the release of Thierry Michel’s film on this matter is a sure-fire way of ensuring this clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Baroness Ashton, freedom of the press. Since 28 November, journalists have been intimidated or arrested on countless occasions. It is very important that this is brought up and discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – something you mentioned – is the insecurity in the East. What is happening is very worrying. Violence continues, the mutiny you talked about, involving Mr Ntaganda, is extremely worrying and has further aggravated the situation. It is also said that Rwandan nationals armed with heavy weapons might be operating in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I will go one step further than you: I think that not only should we say something, we should also question the Rwandan authorities as to whether or not Rwanda is either passively or actively involved in the presence of its nationals armed with heavy weapons when there is an embargo on these weapons in the Congo. I think we must also act here not only because we want peace in the region but, more importantly, to check whether or not the Rwandan authorities are involved. We cannot just stand back and not say anything.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things that I suggest you implement fairly quickly, regardless of our long-term commitment to the Congolese people – something I want as well as you – as they waited so long for these elections, and are now left so disappointed and facing so many problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Kabila should now concentrate on ensuring that his administration is fully transparent and works towards recognised international standards of good governance, fighting widespread corruption, promoting transparency in the extractive industries, upholding the rule of law, protecting human rights for all DRC citizens and, in particular, as mentioned, investigating recurrent stories of atrocities in eastern Congo and bringing those in the irregular militias and armed groups to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The war lord Bosco, who has been wanted by the International Criminal Court since 2006, featured prominently in all of this news with his new militia M23.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is fortunate that this is only one side of the story in Congo, as I heard yesterday in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Dutch aid organisation ZOA, which has a presence there on the ground. This organisation is optimistic regarding the new Congolese Government’s three stated intentions, which cover an effective reform of the army with a single command, strict state control over the country’s mineral resources and diplomatic initiatives in neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda. The recent successful rise of a more disciplined Congolese army in the east of the country fuels hope for better prospects in the future.</p>

The connection between natural resource dependence, armed conflict and weak governance is all too evident in sub-Saharan Africa and what has been occurring in the post-election environment in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a prime example. The trade patterns in favour of hard commodities, due to the growing demand of China and India, set significant challenges for governance and peace-building for both state and non-state actors alike.</p>
<p class="contents">However, natural resources do not have to be a curse. When European settlers arrived in North America, this curse was avoided. These settlers found a resource-rich continent, good soil, timber, vast reserves of gold, silver, coal and oil, and subsequently, over two centuries, America grew to become a prosperous region and a world leader.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa can be the America of the 21st century. It has 60% of the world’s undeveloped arable land, reserves of coal, oil and minerals, as well as large amounts of renewable energy resources. For this reason, and in the interests of good governance, new legislation requiring extractive companies to publish payments to governments on a project-by-project basis is welcome. It is a first step in the right direction. Four hundred million of the world’s poorest people live in sub-Saharan Africa. Effective management of their natural resources and investment in health and education must go hand in hand with strengthened democratic structures and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in changing what has caused the resource curse, then Africans should be able to use these resources – their resources – to build stable, democratic societies. The DRC can be turned around. Good governance will be central to this. That is why good governance must remain a key objective of EU policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a way, it has become a means of measuring the country’s democratic health.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what has happened since the highly publicised trial in 2011? As Ms Vergiat says, the assassins have a name, a face, but some of them are still walking free. General Numbi has never been prosecuted. The body of Fidèle Bazana, Mr Chebeya’s chauffeur, has never been found.</p>
<p class="contents">The appeal by Mr Chebeya’s widow has actually been lodged and, after a year, I have just been told today that a date appears to have finally been set for the consideration of this appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The film by the director Thierry Michel, dedicated to the Chebeya case, was released in July in Kinshasa, but the Ministry of Justice sent a letter to the President of the Republic, the Security Service and the Attorney General calling for the film to be banned. We should salute the courage shown by the International Humanist Federation, the Carter Centre in Kinshasa, the Wallonie-Bruxelles Centre and the many parishes and churches that have decided to defy the bans and organise private screenings. I will be going myself in early July.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that the Congolese elections were flawed. It is now up to the Congolese authorities to prove to us that in spite of these electoral irregularities, the project for a truly democratic Republic of Congo still stands.

I know that determination and hard work are required to achieve this goal, and this includes work in the political sphere. Political leaders, Heads of Government, political organisations and responsible individuals must work together, I repeat, together, to build the future in order to guarantee basic human rights, civil liberties and political, social and economic rights and, most of all, protection for every citizen. I have taken part in a number of observation missions for elections that took place in countries that are on the path to democracy, but what I have read about the present situation in Congo has genuinely shocked me. We are living in the twenty-first century, but reading the words ‘If you resist, we’ll shoot you’ in the Amnesty International report, I had the impression that, in many ways, we are still living in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic elections are essential, but this is not enough. The conditions must be put in place for an education and democratisation process, which is a much broader and longer-term process than just the organisation of the elections themselves. It is only if this takes place and only then that it will be possible to hold out any hope – and I do still have hope – that the situation of people in the Republic of Congo, particularly that of civilians and women, might undergo any significant improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Observing elections is very important, but our role should not be restricted to just drawing up a final report revealing the outcome of the elections. What is equally important is whether democratic mechanisms are really working.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Ms Nedelcheva for her involvement in matters relating to the DRC, both during and after the elections. There is no doubt that the Congolese authorities and citizens have much to accomplish. We would therefore ask the Congolese authorities to ratify, as quickly as possible, the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. We also ask for the implementation of all of the recommendations in the final report by the European Union observation mission. We ask the European Commission to make sure that these recommendations help to create a dialogue among all the constituent parts of Congolese society. We also appeal to the Congolese authorities to guarantee freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of expression, as well as the right to security and physical integrity for all citizens of the Congo. Without these steps, no elections will bring about an improvement in this country’s situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the final report, however, the EU’s election observers state that the election process in Congo collapsed. It was awash with infringements, fraud, deceit and violence – and then Baroness Ashton’s description of it is that its implementation was not perfect. I think this is an understatement at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">Will we really make any progress with such diplomatic descriptions? Do we not need to be considerably tougher ahead of such events as the forthcoming regional and local elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo? The situation is indeed very serious: conflicts, mass murder, acts of sexual violence towards countless women and abductions are taking place and there is persecution of the political opposition, journalists and human rights activists – and it is rare for anyone to be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Congo has a responsibility of its own, but the EU also has a responsibility for the situation in Congo and its vicinity. We need to be much clearer and much tougher, not only in the long term, but also right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, we must continue to provide these missions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to focus on the elections and on what will happen afterwards. I would also like to give my warm thanks once again to Ms Nedelcheva for her report. She must have been braver than I was, for example, in Tunisia to make such clear statements about what was seen by the observers. In Tunisia, there was a strong man who very much wanted to remain president and there were also groups which had an interest in the situation staying unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the facts that we have gathered and the recommendations based on these facts, which will allow us to make a better job of things next time, and if we, and that includes the EU delegation in the country, see it as our homework to implement them, then we already have enough to do. I would like to see our delegation in Kinshasa and also those in other countries being kept up-to-date at regular intervals on the progress of implementing the recommendations and also making proposals as to what we can do here to encourage our partners in the DRC to do the same. That would be a challenge not only for the DRC but for all the countries where we have had electoral observation missions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with the report and I would like to believe that all the report’s recommendations will be implemented promptly and completely. Of course, this should be done before the provincial and local elections, which have, for various reasons, been postponed from the original date of March 2012. In the autumn, I chaired a conference in the European Parliament on the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Even then, the huge interest and hope for the December elections on the part of the citizens and organisations from the DRC and abroad was palpable, and the high turnout confirmed this interest. People want greater stability, security and prosperity of the country through stronger democracy and transparency and, in this respect, the EU and the Great Lakes region are playing a very important role for it is they who can contribute to the full and more rapid implementation of all the recommendations by means of their significant influence on the authorities and responsible leaders of the DRC. Since the elections in December 2011 were designated by international observers as unreliable and lacking in transparency, I believe that ratification of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance should be the first necessary step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is worse still is that the DRC is facing a real human tragedy. The security and humanitarian situation continues to worsen. Let us not overlook the fact that over 2 million people have been displaced, 4.5 million people are living in extremely vulnerable conditions and over a million children are suffering from malnutrition in a country so rich in resources.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UN humanitarian coordinator, those working on the ground are desperately short of financial resources. The World Food Programme (WFP) has reduced its rations and the High Commissioner for Refugees has had to close some of its offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the EU should support the efforts of the Congolese authorities, regional organisations and humanitarian and development agencies. Yes, the international community needs to remain highly committed to the promotion of peace, security, democracy and good governance, all of which are prerequisites for development, but also, in the long term, to the DRC.</p>

<p class="contents">This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on an extremely interesting issue: the link between elections and democracy on African soil. Cases are, in fact, quite different. On the one hand, first of all, there are countries where the electoral process is in place. The most recent example is in Senegal, where, despite certain fears before the elections, everything went well and a certain democratic stability has been established. On the other hand, there are cases, such as recently in Mali, where the military take control and the electoral process is effectively blocked.</p>
<p class="contents">Between these two extremes, there are more complicated cases, such as the DRC – and also Guinea – where electoral processes are organised and then, suddenly, postponed or there is post-election violence, a much more difficult and somehow unpredictable road to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? I believe it is our responsibility, firstly, to support the monitoring of electoral processes with our missions and, secondly, as Ms Striffler has just said, we obviously need to link electoral support with support for development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now know that these expectations have not been met. Although the DRC calls itself democratic, these elections were neither fair nor democratic. We must speak out forcefully about this, as Ms Nedelcheva has done in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous president, Joseph Kabila, claimed that he was the election victor and the opposition was suppressed. In the east of the country, the violent encounters between government troops and so-called rebels have flared up again and it is unclear whether third countries such as Rwanda are involved. In every case, it is the civilian population which suffers and which has not been able to live in peace for decades. The country’s wealth is disappearing in a quagmire of corruption and the DRC comes at or near the bottom of the list in all the international rankings.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community, and the European Union in particular, must take every opportunity to increase the pressure on the President of the DRC to allow genuine democracy in his country – he will have the chance to do this at the next regional elections – and to prevent the Congolese army from oppressing the civilian population. Instead, criminals who are wanted internationally for crimes against humanity, such as Bosco Ntaganda, must finally be arrested and brought before a court.</p>

The fundamental problem in the DRC, as many honourable Members have identified, is governance and, of course, we cannot ignore what happened in the last elections. So we have to build what I would describe as a more contractual relationship with the new government in Kinshasa. That means also that we need stronger political dialogue which will be necessary to guide that cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to keep the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Congo very clearly in mind and to continue to support the dialogue between DRC and Rwanda. The declaration that was made a few days ago is a clear sign that we want to continue to play a constructive role as a regional actor in the Great Lakes. I would also remind honourable Members of the statement that I made on behalf of the EU on 7 June. What I said then was that I was very worried by information that the dynamic between Rwanda and the DRC might be endangered. It is very important that everyone continues their cooperation and makes sure that there is real transparency so that anything that has been done can be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">On the possible support of Rwanda to the rebellion, we take very seriously what the United Nations reports have said about support coming from across the border, so it is important to put an end to any or all support mutinies may receive. It is also important that everyone cooperates to investigate this possibility in all aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that we have to continue to monitor the human rights situation, including gender-based violence, about which honourable Members have spoken. It has to be a priority for the European Union. That means, too, that we need to see regular political dialogue with the DRC authorities and also with civil society. We have got to continue to strengthen the security sector reform so we can ensure that we strengthen the capacity of the state and that means that we impact on crucial sectors. We have to end impunity, end gender-based violence, end the illegal exploitation of natural resources and support the building of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the continued support of the Parliament and pay tribute again to the electoral observation mission, but let me be clear that any future support to elections must depend on the credibility of the process, the implementation of recommendations that have been made by the mission, ownership by the government and a profound reform of the electoral system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, accusations have been made that President Kabila of the DRC has asked for military help from Angola and Zimbabwe. If these prove to be true, the conflict in the east of the DRC could easily turn into a war on a regional scale. All sides seem to have fallen back into their former roles of friends and enemies from the time of the wars in the Congo. As the arms embargoes have repeatedly been broken, the ready availability of weapons constantly reignites the conflicts. The problem is that war is being waged in the DRC in order to gain access to raw materials and the raw materials are being exploited in order for each side to arm itself for war. Past experiences have shown that the UN peacekeepers are not currently in a position to provide adequate protection for the population. It is important for the EU to continue attempting to act as a mediator, but also to follow up the accusations that have been made most recently. We must finally succeed in ensuring that the arms embargoes are complied with and that the civilian population is protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
