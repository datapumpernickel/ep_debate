Your cooperation has been quite seamless.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental technologies are one of the strongest bridges linking the three pillars of the EU’s strategy for growth and competitiveness. They will provide an encouraging opportunity simultaneously to strengthen European growth, competitiveness and employment prospects, and to improve environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The ecoindustry is just as important a branch of industry in Europe as, for example, aviation or pharmaceuticals, and its growth rate is more than 5% a year. The eco-industry at present provides employment for over two million people in the European Union. There is a growing global market for ecotechnology. Japan, Canada, the United States of America, and China are all aiming for a share of this market. Despite growth and fiercer competition, however, much ecoindustry potential remains unrealised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication on an environmental technologies action plan is an attempt to show the direction in which the EU and its Member States should be moving for new insights and feasible ideas to come into being, and it will also show how we might create impartial and competitive market prospects for eco-efficient innovations.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I believe the basic principle here is that merely sufficient demand will give rise to innovation and create a sustainable market. Environmental legislation should be adequately ambitious, clear and sustained, so as to develop new environmental technology. The basic principle should be that environmental costs are fully included in the price of the product. An important factor here is the abolition of damaging subsidies. The true and competitive price of a product, commodity or service, is arrived at when a price tag is also put on the harm to the environment it causes. It can be applied through eco-taxes, for example, or with other charges. Often the mobilising power of several factors is also necessary. Prices for oil and other limited natural resources are so high now that we have to find new and sustainable forms of energy. Europe needs to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the action programme, the Commission has quite rightly stressed the need to find ways of speeding up the practical application of the results of research. Here we need investment not just in research but also venture capital. The entire European Union budget is approximately 1% of the Gross Domestic Product of the Member States. This imposes restrictions on direct financing by the EU. The EU should obviously increase its investment in ecotechnology, nevertheless. This should be visible as a clear area of emphasis in the Framework Programme for Research and the EU’s future Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation. Rural development, cohesion and regional development funds need to be harnessed for the development and utilisation of ecotechnologies. The European Investment Bank should also participate in financing. Many Member States have good systems. These should be made known to, and adopted by, all of them. Citizens should also be advised, through the clearest possible labelling and reliable certificates, of the environmental sustainability of products and services throughout their lifecycle.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the Lisbon Strategy of sustainable growth, improved competitiveness and quality jobs linked to high standards of environmental protection is attainable. This will require, however, unbiased investment in eco-technology research, product development and market access promotion. The European Union needs, then, to aim for a 50% share of the eco-technologies market, a market which is growing globally, as part of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do, of course, sometimes emphasise different aspects, but on many counts they are striving towards the same objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Myller for the detailed and constructive report which she has prepared. The report will be a valuable contribution to the implementation of the action plan and an incentive for considering the next steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for environmental technologies is a policy which creates benefits for all sides, in that it strengthens the competitiveness of the European economy and reinforces sustainable development. That is why environmental technologies and ecological innovation are now recognised as basic components of the reinforced Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific actions planned in the action plan cover the supply and demand of environmental technologies. As Mrs Myller has just emphasised, demand for environmental technologies must be stimulated by determining objectives with respect to the performance of basic products, services and methods.</p>
<p class="contents">These objectives must be an incentive for innovation and for opening up the market to technologies which benefit the environment. The cornerstone will be the concept of the environmental life cycle and this will also address one of the concerns formulated in Mrs Myller's report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first pilot stage, this concept will be more suitably processed and tested on the ground before being implemented in a more organised proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern formulated in the report concerns the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the action plan. It should be stressed that a number of these actions are addressed specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises, even if they are not mentioned, such as the action for improving the tests and verifying the performance of environmental technologies and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, especially with the development of ecological innovation and the promotion of products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, support with Community financing programmes, as proposed in the framework programme for research and technological support which is expected to be approved, is very important to the development of new technologies. In the present case, I should like to refer to the contribution of the European Environment Agency, which has developed a new Internet portal for environmental technologies linked to numerous databases which are useful to anyone developing technological applications, as well as to simple users.</p>
<p class="contents">The future implementation of the action plan will depend on the active participation of the Member States. I hope that the preparation of roadmaps at national level, which was approved by the Spring Council in 2005, will give the Member States a new opportunity to study the specific national measures needed in order to implement the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Action by the Member States is equally important on the subject of public procurement, given that ecological, green procurement makes an effective contribution to the creation and extension of environmental technology markets. The promotion of environmental technologies worldwide through international trade and of cooperation on development supplements the cohesive set of measures provided for in the environmental technologies action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the political support of the European Parliament and its constructive proposals will help the European Commission to achieve the objectives of the action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reading these documents, one finds no evidence of any renewed discussion within the Commission about the point, or lack of it, of an ambitious environmental policy. I think you really should take the figures in your own report for the Commission on environmental technologies and put them in front of Commissioner Verheugen. As long ago as 2003, the global market in environmental goods was worth EUR 500 billion – more than the markets for air and space travel, and growing since then at the rate of 5% per annum, which is more than the rate at which the gross domestic product is growing. What more, then, do we want?</p>
<p class="contents">This successful development is the success of a very ambitious environmental policy, and I can do no other than encourage you, Mr Dimas, not to allow yourself to be led astray and to be every bit as ambitious as your predecessor in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such requirements can bring about changes in investment priorities, ensuring that money is channelled into research and innovation, with great potential for the future. Indeed, if we listen to President Bush, the world will only be spared the consequences of climate change if such investment is stimulated.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing its proposals, the Commission is now committed to making impact assessments, but the environmental industries do not believe that these properly take account of the real stimulus to innovation derived from setting high environmental standards. They say that the Commission should look again at its methodology. Its impact assessments need to be adjusted to take full account of the huge economic benefits that this stimulus can give to our economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I would have liked rather more specific details because, so far, the environment is being identified with just two or three aspects of what we may call sustainable development — I am referring to climate change or the view that environmental technologies are those that improve the industrial processes for preventing emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that there are many other extremely important environmental technologies that are not integrated in a systematic manner and that are not treated in the same way within the European Union's research projects: examples are conservation of existing resources and combating disasters. I am talking about extremely important aspects, such as the fight against the problem of forest fires, the fight to maintain our heritage and the fight to maintain nature.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is something else that I believe must be raised at this time. If Europe is to behave consistently, both with itself and with its projects, we must consider developing a line within environmental and sustainable development technologies dedicated to water and to the administration of the most scant resources. Specifically, we must make an effort in relation to all technologies that can be applied in Africa. We are talking about the fight against poverty. In Johannesburg, many people criticised the fact that the importance of all technologies dedicated to the supply of water were being emphasised, on the grounds that it would lead to the development of large multinationals. That is not the problem: we must provide the parts of the world living in poverty with instruments for conserving water and conserving the environment. That is what I am calling for on this significant date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Development of the wider use of environmental technologies is not only a task for technology developers but also requires the full involvement of all EU companies and citizens concerned. The European Parliament has an essential role in explaining the importance of this project and mobilising the necessary public support.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I say a few words about funding and investment, I would like to say that I fully agree with Mr Davies regarding the importance of impact assessments, extended correct state-of-the-art impact assessments for environmental technologies and for environmental policies in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding funding, as with many technologies, the development of environmental technologies requires substantial investment. Bank financing has an important role to play. This is why the European Investment Bank is involved in implementing the action plan and has urgently developed facilities such as its support for low carbon investments related to the European Union emission-trading scheme. This is one of the cases where regulation has led to the emission-trading system and is a very important incentive for developing new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk capital is also crucial to support small and medium-sized enterprises. In the future framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, the Commission has proposed a continuation of the venture capital fund, with particular emphasis on investment financing for eco-innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Community programmes also have a role to play in support of investments in environmental technologies and eco-innovation. This is particularly the case for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. I would call on Member States and their regional governments to seize the opportunity and include eco-innovation in their programming in order to maximise the synergies between environment protection and economic development. Naturally, all Commission proposals are highly dependent on the issue of the discussions on the financial framework for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, fighting the fires in Spain and elsewhere, especially during this period of drought, is very important. I know that rain has not fallen in certain areas in Spain and Portugal for more than a year. I am sure that new technologies to fight and prevent forest fires could be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
