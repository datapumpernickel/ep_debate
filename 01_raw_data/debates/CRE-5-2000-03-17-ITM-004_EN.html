<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been analysing this proposal since October 1999 and approved this draft legislative resolution unanimously on 23 February 2000. I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Amendment No 1 on the inclusion of a Recital 2a. This amendment supplements the Council approach, which is purely commercial, and opts for a proposal with wider economic, human and food quality aims. Whereas the Council only talks about the market, the European Parliament highlights the economic interest for the Community of the production of these grain legumes. Given the deficit of protein crops in the European Union, Parliament considers that this system should be improved without cutting the level of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament’s Amendment No 2 proposes that seed vetches should also be included in the aid system. Aid for seeds already exists for rice, chickpeas and lentils. We propose this aid because, as we all know, the production of seeds is subject to supplementary technical and quality control requirements, so that if the cultivation of seeds were not supported by some form of aid, this could have extremely negative consequences for the quality of production of seed vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment No 3 indicates that, in our opinion, the Commission should, without further delay, make proposals for the 2000-2003 period.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, Mr President, I would like to point out that in 1993 – which is some time ago now – the Council indicated that it intended to gradually strengthen the current aid system for grain legumes. However, this has still not been done. Secondly, successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system. The maximum guaranteed area is being systematically reduced, thus penalising time and again the farmers who are suffering reductions in aid of up to 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament would really like to see is an improvement in the system. However, we appreciate what the Commission is telling us, that this is a time of serious budgetary restrictions that we could not implement without reducing aid. That is why we are presenting this proposal, which is really a maintenance proposal, and what we are saying to the Commission is that, without further delay, proposals must be drawn up at the latest for the 2000-2003 period to achieve an improvement in this system without decreasing aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their collaboration and support, as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Thanks also to the Commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and I hope it will be open to our proposals.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity, although it does split it into two, nor the amount of aid per hectare. The only new element is the substitution of the management committee by the cereal management committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Spanish saying goes, which is very much in agreement with this regulation, ‘<span class="italic">Esto son lentejas; si quieres las tomas y si no las dejas’ </span>[‘here are some lentils, take them or leave them’]. Consequently, my Group will support the rapporteur's report and, above all, will particularly support Amendment No 2, which proposes the inclusion of areas dedicated to the production of seed vetches in the aid system, as this will lead to high-quality crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we have missed the opportunity to support a substantial, very arid area of southern Europe, which has no other crop alternative for its soil. Furthermore, the demand for vetches for feeding livestock is increasing all the time, as shown, at least in Spain, by the fact that the area sown in the last three years has exceeded the proposed maximum guaranteed area by 100 000 hectares per year on average.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the food problems we have had in the European Union have been caused by feeding herbivores with animal-based feedingstuffs, and if we do not encourage the feeding of livestock with plant proteins, such as legumes, and lower their price, farmers will continue to resort to animal meal due to the enormous pressure of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it just remains for me to lament, once again, the fact that the Commission's agricultural policy is more concerned with reducing spending – or, at best, not increasing it, as on this occasion – than with maintaining a genuine European agricultural sector that is so essential for the equilibrium of the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Grain legumes are a traditional crop in certain areas of southern Europe, including Spain and, more specifically, Castilla-La Mancha, the region I come from, which contains one third of the total area dedicated to these crops in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is therefore to avoid damaging the aid system for this sector of agriculture and, more specifically, for the production of chickpeas, lentils and vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in Spanish gastronomic culture and in our diet, the Mediterranean diet, which is now so highly thought of by scientists, which includes dried pulses in our traditional recipes.</p>
<p class="contents">The purchase of dried pulses in Spain has been increasing by up to 5% annually. In my country, the consumption of these is 6.5 kg per head annually and anyone who knows how these products are cooked can vouch for the fact that this is a very substantial amount.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious customs, for example, mean that we do not eat meat during Lent and due to the wiliness and common sense of our compatriots, meat has been replaced by other dishes – delicious dishes, of course – such as our lentil and spinach stew.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about uses that have been consolidated throughout history and are now consumed throughout the year, including by non-believers and those who do not practise a religion, and that have left an almost infinitely varied series of main courses based on dried pulses, which undoubtedly increase the consumption figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming. At times like this, when we are seeing fraudulently-fattened livestock and the use of unauthorised products, it becomes essential for the market to provide reasonably-priced, good quality natural feedingstuffs, such as some of those that this regulation concerns, and specifically vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are talking about Community protection for a crop which last year, in my region, provided an honest living for around 17 000 families. Moreover, this is a sector in which, fortunately, there has not been a proliferation of bounty-hunters who move into agriculture in order to receive grants from the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are dealing with traditional crops farmed by people who devote themselves to these crops from generation to generation, and who have contributed to the formation of a large part of the countryside and cuisine of substantial regions of Europe, which still interest us and which we should maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission's proposals and the improvements which, by way of amendment, are contained in María Izquierdo's report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also draw your attention to the fact that, in recent years, conventional farming has been put under pressure. Prices have fallen for just about every product. This is what some people call stability. Farmers experience it somewhat differently because costs are, of course, rising and price freezes will therefore automatically be experienced as a setback. I would also recall the fact that the Commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain. Wheat growers, in particular, will be affected very badly, which they already are because of a 15% fall in prices, but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops. This means, moreover, that, especially in the northern part of the EU, there will be further price falls in the offing. On behalf of my Group, I shall, as I said, support an extension to the arrangements, but I would strongly urge the Commission, before 2002-2003, to make a concerted effort to investigate possible changes to the way in which we employ resources so that we can, in the future too, safeguard that group of farmers which, until now, has been supported by means of the aid arrangements in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that the system of aid established in 1989 has been modified several times, but no report has been presented on the application of the present system. Now, by advocating a maximum guaranteed area of 400 000 hectares, the Commission wants to reduce the average production area over the last three years by around 100 000 hectares, which will mean considerable reductions in aid. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, although we do not disagree with splitting the maximum guaranteed area into two, we feel it is necessary to adjust the historical reference period in order to calculate each of the maximum guaranteed areas excluding the last three years, in order to reduce the damaging impact for Portugal on products designed for human consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to point out that it is vital for Portugal that dry bean should be considered in this system, even without the change to the maximum guaranteed surface. We therefore firmly believe that the Commission should bear in mind these amendments to the new system which it hopes to establish for grain legumes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI) </span>Mr President, I would again like to thank the rapporteur, Maria Izquierdo Rojo, for an excellent and constructive report. There are two Commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes. The first is a report on the aid scheme in place for grain legumes, and the second a proposal for improved administration of the system. What vegetables are we actually talking about? I know that the Spanish members know the subject well, but I should mention that by grain legumes are meant three annual vegetables with a high protein content and which are gathered in the form of dry seeds. Lentils and chickpeas serve as food for humans, while the seeds of vetches, which to us are more unusual vegetables, are used as animal feed. Grain legumes are grown as field crops, particularly in the southern part of the Union, as they thrive well in dry climates. In fact Spain accounts for 90% of all EU grain legume production.</p>
<p class="contents">Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme that was remodelled with the Agenda 2000 programme, although they can be used in crop rotation schemes involving other crops such as corn. Grain legumes are covered by their own scheme where the amount of fixed aid per hectare is EUR 181 and the maximum guaranteed area is 400 000 hectares. The scheme was established in 1989 when the growing area of grain legumes was reduced at the expense of corn, which was already suffering from overproduction. The special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain growing areas by means of the aid per hectare arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the conclusions of the Commission’s report? An examination of how the scheme has been applied reveals that the MGA of 400 000 hectares has been systematically exceeded. There are two conclusions to be drawn from this. First, the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and, second, the growing areas have to be brought under better control. The MGA overruns in the last few years have shown themselves to be mainly with regard to vetches. Although the scheme is being applied satisfactorily as a whole, MGA management is problematic, as those responsible for the overruns are not being treated any differently from other producers.</p>
<p class="contents">So how could the system be improved? We should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it. We are in a situation in which the Agenda 2000 reform has been adopted and international trade negotiations are drawing closer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the rapporteur’s proposed amendment whereby the current aid scheme for vetch farmers could be combined with another market arrangement, i.e., that for seed vetches, would not achieve the improvement desired. This is a reference to Amendment No 2. It cannot be adopted for two reasons: firstly, the schemes are mutually exclusive, as in one scheme the seeds, in principle, have to be harvested as animal feed, while, in the other, they are designated for sowing. The other reason is that it might involve extra expense.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report recommends that the MGA should be divided into two parts based on the earlier land area division in the proportion 40/60. It would divide up thus: 1 600 000 hectares would be used for the production of lentils and chickpeas, and 240 000 hectares would be used for the production of vetches. In addition, it is proposed that the Management Committee for Dried Fodder be replaced by the Management Committee for Cereals. The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission will adopt the rapporteur’s amendments that reinforce its position, proposing that the Commission submit a new report, as in Amendment No 3, and seek ways of improving the system, as in Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament, in the light of my comments, the proposal will probably not be difficult to adopt so that it can be applied from the marketing year 2000 – 2001 onwards.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
