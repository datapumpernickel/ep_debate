The decision to close magnetic steel production would put 450 jobs directly and larger numbers indirectly at risk. Further job losses in the region already affected in the past would be a most unwelcome blow. It would be particularly unfortunate, in view of the long tradition of steel making in this region, the quality of the product produced at Terni and the skill levels of the workforce involved. Therefore it is with some relief that I heard reports today of an announcement by the Italian Minister of Productive Activities, Mr Marzano, that the deadline of the decision on the future of the AST plant has been postponed to a date yet to be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because of concerns such as these, regarding the social consequences of corporate restructuring, that the Commission has sought to promote a response at Community level to the issue of how corporate restructuring is managed. We sought, with the active involvement of the social partners, to develop and promote issues that seem relevant in the present case, investing in people on a permanent basis, developing employability through training and retraining, seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies, redeploying, wherever possible, workers affected by restructuring operations and anticipating market and technological developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that two years ago the Commission launched a consultation with the social partners, particularly on this issue of restructuring, because unfortunately, there were many problems in many different Member States. The Commission presented a report with some proposals. We have the response of the social partners in October and we believe that through dialogue and agreed measures, particularly on issues to which I have already referred, everything that supports employability, the social partners can play an important role. It is my sincere hope that in the window of opportunity that now appears to have opened all such possibilities will be given full consideration to see what contribution they can make to alleviating the crisis faced by the Terni plant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tajani (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Europe cannot remain silent in the face of what is happening in one of the Union’s most important steel-making sites: without any prior notification the Thyssen Krupp Group has decided to halt the production of magnetic steel in the steel plants of Terni. This is an unwarranted action and betrays an agreement signed up to in 1994 during privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As noted by you, Commissioner, the German company is preparing to sack hundreds of workers because it prefers to protect other European sites and invest outside the Union, in South Korea. Thanks to the intervention of the Italian Government – you mentioned, Commissioner, the intervention of Mr Marzano, the Minister for Productive Activities – and the extraordinary extent to which all the local institutions, citizens, parties and workers have mobilised themselves, Thyssen Krupp has decided to put off its decision to close the plant.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Commission cannot, however, raise their voices to help solve a crisis which is not, Mr President, Commissioner, an Italian issue, but involves the whole of Europe. That is why we are asking that the Commission, when presenting the third report on economic and social cohesion on 18 February, clearly sets out its own proposals for protecting the industrial sector and, in particular, the iron and steel industry in the context of its new cohesion policy due to commence from 1 January 2007. I am also convinced that the Commission’s battle with the US in respect of market shares in steel production must be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the problem does not concern only Italy, nor is it a purely incidental matter, but rather a general problem facing the steel industry in Europe. The crisis involves not just one company, but many and it seems to me that the Commission in comparison to the US it giving it its full attention. Indeed, we cannot adopt a carefree and superficial approach to such a sensitive issue on which the future of thousands and thousands of jobs, and therefore of thousands and thousands of families, hangs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Italian case of Terni, I am convinced that the Commission must intervene to deal with certain anomalies. The steelworks in Terni, in contrast to what was established in December 1994 by the commission for the control of concentrations, are currently owned exclusively by Thyssen Krupp, this being a clear example of a concentration: the group is currently the only producer of magnetic grain-oriented steel in Europe. Does not the Commission consider that this is potentially a distortion of competition? Furthermore, because of its activities in Italy, Thyssen Krupp has received Community aid on the grounds that Terni, where the steelworks are located, is a region in industrial decline that comes within Objective 2. Does the Commission not therefore consider that it should check whether the Community aid has been employed correctly by Thyssen Krupp? Next, does not the Commission consider that it should check whether Thyssen Krupp has received further State aid in breach of the competition rules? The investment in South Korea, announced yesterday, is a source of concern: I would not want European funds and possible funding provided by the German Government to be used not for boosting European economic growth, employment and development in Europe, but employed in South Korea, in the sole interests of one company which – I repeat – has not upheld the agreements it signed up to with Italy when privatisation took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of workers are now waiting for the Commission to take action in order to ensure that the Union’s rules are observed. A few days ago I heard President Prodi and Commissioner Monti speak and even in what you said, Commissioner, I perceive a desire to move forward, to protect workers’ interests, to resolve a problem which – I repeat – is not limited geographically to Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the President of the Commission, after listening to the Thyssen Krupp management, will take decisive measures to intervene in the way that I hope so that the Commission may act collectively. The President of the Commission and all the Commissioners should continue in their present direction: they can count on Parliament’s support as demonstrated by the desire to reach a unified resolution on this sensitive and important issue, which I think will be adopted unanimously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With many years trade union experience behind me, seldom have I witnessed such tension and such pride.</p>
<p class="contents">The announcement to close the magnetic section of ST by Thyssen Krupp means the loss of 900 highly qualified jobs and internal disruption as a result in the Terni iron and steel plant thereby posing an immediate threat to its plans, its productive capacity and its overall job prospects: we are talking of 4 500 jobs, including those companies affected by the knock-on effects. Over and above that, though, this is, I repeat, a slap in the face for regional local government which has worked effectively and is still working, by utilising the structural funds, to create a more favourable climate of production for the company and its investments: infrastructure projects, training and professional retraining, energetic supply measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until yesterday everything was fine; then, in September 2003, production for electric motors, that is to say non-grain-oriented steel, was abandoned. At that time, and again in November, a solemn commitment was given concerning all the programmes aimed at making Terni a centre of excellence for magnetic steel. At the end of January, however, after only two months, there was an about turn: even the production of grain-oriented steel used for transformers was closed down and the closure of the plant was announced with dramatic internal consequences: there was a threat that the plant would be broken up destroying its integrated structure which, given the varied nature of its production, enabled it to balance out market fluctuations and disperse strategic functions such as marketing. It also had major external consequences affecting Italy and Europe in general. Magnetic steel, which is produced only in Terni, is the only special strategic steel for the energy sector; becoming dependent on Russia and the US will also have a negative knock-on effect for users who are major exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">The news that arrived at the end of the meeting held today in Palazzo Chigi therefore explains why the workers and the inhabitants of the city took to the streets and why they have been able to broaden their network of alliances and support. On 18 February genuine negotiations will finally get under way without a gun being held to the trade union’s head. The deadline of 27 February has been cancelled, 80 contracts which had expired and which Thyssen Krupp wanted to cancel are being renewed; it is a sign that the multinational feels isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to this preliminary result the pressure must be maintained and the attention of all the institutions must be kept engaged. On Thursday this Parliament will make its voice heard with a resolution on this issue which genuinely symbolises the need for new systems of industrial relations and more advanced methods for linking public investment and industrial strategy. We are fighting to ensure that there is a clear message that the dispute should end in a positive manner: a decisive dispute to put a stop to the downgrading of production in Italy and the weakening of industrial plant throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Calò (ELDR). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, in 1950 Robert Schuman launched the idea of a European Coal and Steel Community open to all States, thereby creating the basis for the complex and difficult journey of European unification, the most recent developments of which we are now experiencing. Even then the importance of steel in the European context was clear. I am not surprised therefore that the debate in this Parliament concerning the ‘Terni case’ has aroused so much interest and the opinions expressed have to a large extent not been dependent on political affiliations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European iron and steel sector is currently suffering as a result of the decision taken by the US to impose import duties on steel, principally from the European Union. The crisis in Italy is important because it involves other iron and steel centres, like the steel plant in Genoa-Cornigliano. In that context, the announcement by Thyssen Krupp, the owner of the Terni iron and steel plant, that it is going to invest in South Korea to produce steel in Asia is of major importance and is causing a good deal of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Terni plant was sold in 1994 as part of the process of privatisation promoted by the Institute for Reconstruction of Industry (IRI), subject to a guarantee that its activities would continue in Italy and that jobs would be protected. This is not a company in crisis but a company that produces a leading-edge product used to make thin metal sheets for electronic transformers. Furthermore, there are no other factories of this type in Italy. The technology used at Terni and the studies and research carried out in recent years are of an extremely high standard. Losing skills and know-how is exactly the opposite of the knowledge economy to which President Prodi recently referred in this Parliament. It is no coincidence that directors, managers, researchers and local politicians lined up alongside the workforce to fight on behalf of the product and the research associated with it. About 900 workers are likely to lose their jobs, not counting the knock-on effects.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, therefore, ignore the fact that the German multinational received funds and tax breaks from the European Union when it decided to acquire the Terni plant. I also wonder what the significance is, in global terms, of transferring production to Korea, what technological skills workers employed in South-East Asia have, what trade union rights they have and whether those rights will be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">At a meeting last December, some European Union industrial manufacturers in the footwear and textiles sector posed a number of questions concerning those matters to the delegation from China, which is preparing itself to become the factory of the world. The replies were extremely evasive and we had no grounds for thinking that elsewhere on the continent – with the exception of Japan – the situation was any better. Above all, in a market economy based on competition the rules must …</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgantini (GUE/NGL). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, nine hundred jobs lost may be no more than a statistic, but it amounts to more for the lives of the human beings affected. The plant in Terni is at the very heart of the city’s fabric; 900 jobs: the lives of young and old workers. The steelworks in Terni are the city’s history and pride; they represent the memories of the air raids that took place in the Second World War. When the management of Thyssen Krupp announced the closure of the magnetic steel section, the whole city – as Mr Sacconi said – took to the streets with the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Terni is not an isolated operation: in Europe, Arcelor, Lucchini and Thyssen itself are currently preparing to reorganise production; plants in Belgium, the blast furnaces of Servola in Trieste have already received threats of closure, despite trade union action. Massive disinvestment and relocation of valuable products to non-European countries are in fact destroying European production capacity. Community funds, which have been considerable over recent decades, have been used to dismantle State controlled iron and steel works. The subsidies paid to private entrepreneurs such as Riva, Lucchini, Falk and other foreign groups have been used for the remodernisation of production capacity and the specialisation of the Italian iron and steel industry along profit-making lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund and the structural funds have been used to finance restructuring and retraining programmes and have led to a younger workforce being employed in the sector – in Italy today the average age of iron and steel workers is 30 – but it is precisely this new generation of highly qualified young employees whose existence is under threat. In my view, the absence of a coordinated plan in the European Union to relaunch the iron and steel industry has contributed to individual plants in various countries – albeit at the cutting edge – being transferred elsewhere in order to fit in with the industrial plans of individual entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Thyssen plant in Terni, which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the Russian company Duferco, is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to Mexico, Korea, China and India. There is no sign of innovation, new research or competitive challenge: the only thing visible is a dangerous move towards retrenchment which, if not stopped in time, will have repercussions for employment and social cohesion, not just in Italy but throughout Europe. Despite the drastic reduction of employment in the sector in Italy, which has fallen from 100 000 jobs in the 1980s to 40 000 today, the steel sector still has an excellent position in the market because it is the second European producer. In order to maintain that position, however, requires industrial choices to be made by the Italian Government – which do not appear to be forthcoming – and a clear commitment of intent at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Steel and electricity are economic indicators of absolute excellence in a country, a measure of economic development. It is therefore essential that the European Union introduce systems for tackling pollution and monitoring the environmental impact, which are priorities if the aims of the Kyoto protocol are to be pursued. On this basis a new steel industry can be launched. We must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products, environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, in response to threats to employment and gradual social impoverishment, the Commission should give a commitment to review the rules governing the structural funds. Granting of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years, subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be reclaimed in the event that production is moved elsewhere. In my view, Directive 98/59 on protection in respect of collective dismissals should also be reviewed so as to consolidate the measures designed to protect employment by making provision not only for information procedures for workers’ representatives, but also requiring a commitment on the part of the social partners to open appropriate and binding negotiations with a view to preventing dismissals or the reorganisation of production to the detriment of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The jobs in the steelworks at Terni must be saved, as must the jobs in other Italian and European plants and for this reason I believe that a meeting is required between the governments of the Member States concerned, the social partners and, in this specific case, Thyssen Krupp, to draw up a new industrial plan to relaunch the magnetic and inox sectors at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thyssen Krupp is the only case of a multinational that has grown thanks to the work of hundreds of Italian workers and huge funds placed at its disposal, either by the Italian State or the European Union, and then has decided to close, in this case in Terni, in Umbria, with the risk of leaving 900 workers and their families destitute and also wasting a huge resource of professional skills.</p>
<p class="contents">As other Members have mentioned, the announcement of closure took everybody by surprise: no prior notice was given to the workers or the national and local authorities and, above all, no justification was given because today the closure appears to be dictated more by questionable strategic company choices than by specific technical reasons, given that in Italy production costs are lower, the quality is higher and the professionalism of the workforce beyond question: there have been steelworks at Terni for 120 years. Would it, I ask myself, be acceptable for Thyssen Krupp to go ahead with the decision to close after taking everything possible from that territory and those people: professionalism, resources and even their hopes for the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am convinced that large companies – the multinationals – are certainly a source of employment and development for the whole of Europe, a few remarks must be made: to say that we do not agree with some of the behaviour indulged in by European capitalism is neither a secret nor a shock: a capitalism which, in theory, is completely committed to the free market, to pure competition and to the flexibility of the global market but which, in reality, expects to be generously assisted time and again, requiring tax incentives from national governments and all kinds of structures, infrastructures and facilities from local administrations, not to mention the granting of Community funds. Meanwhile production has already been moved to India, with an eye on China, where the cost of labour is ridiculous and laws for the protection of workers and the environment non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, as other Members have already stated, these multinationals often take advantage of the opportunity offered by privatisation – which unfortunately, most of the time, are no more than asset sales – to acquire our family jewels at knock down prices, as was exactly the case with Thyssen Krupp at Terni.</p>
<p class="contents">So, moving beyond these contentious matters, what are we asking of the European Commission? Firstly, we are asking for immediate measures, within its powers, to safeguard the iron and steel centre in Terni and to avert the danger of Thyssen Krupp’s plant being closed; secondly: a commitment to check that European regulations are effectively applied in order to protect workers’ rights; thirdly: a further commitment to make the granting of Community funds conditional on agreements guaranteeing employment and subject to precise conditions and limits on the relocation of plant. We also expect a committed development strategy to be set in place for the iron and steel sector throughout Europe. Finally, should Thyssen Krupp go ahead with its decision to close the plant, we call on the Commission to check whether all the competition rules have been complied with, in particular as regards any possible abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, whilst we are satisfied with the initial positive steps today of the Italian Government, gained as a result of determined action across the board, we consider that that is all the more reason not to lower our guard. We believe unreservedly in the free market, but we also believe that there is no free market without democracy and, above all, without respect for workers and nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, this is the task of the European institutions, but I also think that that task should stop there. I do not think it is the task of the European Commission, the European Institutions or the Italian Government to criticise the decisions of companies operating in Europe to relocate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is outcry at the scandalous possibility that certain products are to be transferred to India, China or South America. Personally, I consider that that is part of the rules of the game which certain countries in the European Union – primarily Italy – have taken advantage of for many years: placing at the disposal of the international economy its own assets, for example the availability of labour. This is not intended to be disrespectful to the 450 employees of Thyssen Krupp in Terni who risk losing their jobs; it means also remembering the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who may find work in China and in India; it means also making provision – I refer to Terni which has already absorbed 10 000 surplus jobs in the iron and steel sector in recent years – so that in Italy and Europe, in areas of excellence, it is possible and necessary to produce something else for export to European and international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I would make the point that Italy and Europe need the confidence of investors to invest in Terni, just like anywhere else. To imagine that politicians can criticise in this way the choices made by investors would not be to render a good service, nor would it serve any real useful purpose for employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the 1970s and 1980s, brand new factories were closed down. I have to tell you once again this evening: twenty years on, that wound is still open and sore. I therefore feel the current crises particularly keenly, especially that of Terni, where 900 jobs are under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">While I was preparing this speech, after reading the motion for a resolution, I re-read my report on steel, which Parliament approved in 1996. At the time, having observed that successive restructuring had cost over 500 000 jobs in twenty years, I was in a position to state that, and I quote item F, ‘the Community steel industry may these days be regarded as generally cost-competitive and technological effective, even though the problem of overcapacity could emerge again in the event of a new crisis’.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years later, towards the end of 1998, the industry was struck by a devastating crisis following a market crash in Asia. Since then, we have seen a succession of crises – some small, some large-scale, the result of local or world level restructuring – leading to a catalogue of redundancies. As recently as the beginning of 2003, it was Arcelor and the announcement of thousands of job losses. Today it is Terni and the thousand jobs deemed surplus to requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to attribute greater importance to my 1996 report than it deserves, reading it brought back to me the risks that were already bubbling under the surface: unbridled globalisation, American pressure and production at the cost of the social and environmental aspects. It also recalled, however, measures that were needed to prevent further crises – measures in terms of social acquis and social rights, conditions of State aid, training for employees, respect for the environment, diversification, research, new products and the penetration of new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution before us recalls others, and this proves, unfortunately, that our warnings were not heeded. The Terni situation is symptomatic. This is why we must rein in the great roaring machine, not only because the workers demand it of us, but also because if we let go, then great swaths of the European iron and steel industry will go by the wayside. In this context, despite the efforts and sacrifices of workers in the past, there is a danger that the European Steel Industry will disappear completely, followed swiftly by those industries that use steel products; in the fullness of time, therefore, it will be European industry as a whole that is under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Further proof that there is no such thing as a good economy without a social element, without training and without respect for the workers. In the short-term, some will make a profit, but that is not the issue for us. The issue for us is defending the economy, industry and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make a few specific comments based on the statements made by the honourable Members on the role and facility for intervention of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as far as the international dimension is concerned, it is clear that global negotiations are under way on the question of steel and the European Union wants to achieve an agreement on subsidies because, as we know, there are countries which grant subsidies, especially outside the frameworks of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is European social law. And I think that here it is very important to know that, of course, the final decision on a company is taken by the company's management, but it is obliged to follow the specific directives on consultation with workers and on information, and prompt information, for them, and Community law on mass redundancies. The implementation of these directives in the first stage, because they are national law, concerns every country and, of course, it also concerns the European Union, because they are European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the Structural Funds, in other words European money for companies. Here we can see two categories of intervention by the European Union. First, as regards direct subsidies to companies. I would remind you that, for several years now, subsidies in the steel sector have not been allowed. They are banned on the basis of the ECSC Treaty and continue to be banned but, where state corporations are subsidised, then there are commitments, there are agreements. A company cannot take European money and not keep to the terms on which it was granted and, of course, in such cases, the agreements are signed at national level and the national courts have jurisdiction to impose any sanctions. The question of subsidies is one aspect of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The second, however, which is also important, is intervention in the matter of addressing the social repercussions. And here it is important for us to see that there is experience in many countries of restructuring of the Structural Funds, especially the Social Fund, in order to support workers and, even more importantly, to retrain them. The most important weapon in restructuring of companies is continuing training of workers so that they can deal with the problems of their sector and can re-enter the job market at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that it is important in the negotiations taking place at the moment at trilateral level, between companies, workers and the Italian Government, for account to be taken of this possibility of supporting and assisting the workers via the Social Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
