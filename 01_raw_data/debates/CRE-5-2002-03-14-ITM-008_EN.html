<p class="contents">I must confess, Mr President, that having taken part, together with other Members of this House, in a meeting in Los Pozos with ‘Tirofijo’ and the leadership of FARC, this decision comes as no surprise to me. On that occasion we begged for the release of the European Union citizens kidnapped by FARC and also, at the request of his wife and daughter, of a Colombian senator who was ill. Needless to say, we achieved nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President, this Parliament must raise its voice once again to condemn all the murders, including the recent murder of senator Marta Catalina Daniels, all the violations of human rights in Colombia and to demand that FARC releases all the people it has kidnapped, including the Presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament has always demonstrated its commitment to the way of peace and of dialogue to solve the conflict, but in the knowledge that dialogue must be sought by both parties and that a society cannot remain forever deaf, dumb and blind to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Sunday, Colombian society demonstrated civil courage and democratic maturity. This is why, Mr President, today more than ever and on the eve of the forthcoming Presidential elections, the international community and this Parliament and the European Union in general must continue to show solidarity and their support for Colombia’s legitimate government, for the entire spectrum of democratic forces and of civil society, with the demand, as always, that in order to overcome the serious problems affecting the country we must insist on the way of peace, harmony, reconciliation, justice and dialogue, and insist that the problems cannot be overcome by violence, because Colombian society is crying out for peace. To conclude, Mr President, I feel that this Parliament should stand side by side with Colombia in this crucial exercise of the Presidential elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Various political groups tabled motions for resolutions and then we agreed on a joint motion for a resolution, that should now – I believe – have the support of most of the House. As previous speakers have said, the situation in Colombia is a painful issue for all of us, because we had great hopes for the successful conclusion of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">President Pastrana has dedicated his mandate almost entirely to these efforts, with a series of very generous concessions to the guerrilla organisations: he has opened negotiations, both with FARC and the ELN and yet has achieved little.</p>
<p class="contents">In specific terms, he has given FARC a territory the size of Switzerland, an entire enclave in which they can travel with absolute freedom, and lastly, when it still looked as though negotiations might break down, President Pastrana even extended the agreements or negotiations, in an attempt to conclude an agreement. During this extension phase, FARC launched a campaign of kidnappings and murders, which culminated in the murder of Senator Daniels and the kidnapping of a presidential candidate, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt. At the same time, FARC is continuing its extortion activities, claiming a supposed right to impose taxes on drug-trafficking organisations, which I believe has completely stripped it of any legitimacy, because an organisation that takes part in acts of gratuitous violence and which, furthermore, tries to make money out of drugs trafficking, ultimately loses any basis for legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, therefore, we are rather disillusioned and feel a degree of despair, although this does not mean that we are going to give up on the possibility that an agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the first aspect is to state that FARC has failed to meet its commitments and has all but abandoned the peace process; it has made it impossible for the government to negotiate, because you cannot negotiate with killers and kidnappers. On the other hand, it is necessary to try to restart the peace process and to leave the door open for negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have always supported this process of negotiation, including practical proposals, designed to alleviate some of the specific social problems. It has become clear that the definitive solution to the problem of Colombia does not simply involve an end to the violence, but that we must get to the root of the social and economic problems that are causing this. In order to reach that point, however, peace must first be achieved on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know at the moment whether it is possible to add a little trust and calm to the situation, but I would say that the European Union has – where the problem of Colombia is concerned – the advantage of distance and, furthermore, the willingness it has always shown to help Colombia with its exports, for example, in a range of key sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution aims, therefore, on the one hand, to illustrate the responsibility of those who have caused the breakdown of the peace process and, on the other, to leave the door to negotiation open and to call on the European institutions to patiently continue with this lengthy and complicated task, by providing the aid necessary to make this process easier and, of course, by not giving in to despair, and instead by trusting that, ultimately, there will be a return to reason and to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European institutions can work together in this aspect, and we hope that the Commission can indeed help to resolve this deadly and longstanding conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The interventions I have heard so far strike me as somewhat lacking in balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall read the words of the non-governmental human rights organisation ‘Human Rights Watch’: “The human rights situation clearly deteriorated in the course of last year. In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time. Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas. The national epidemic of kidnappings, half of which were committed by guerrillas, gave no signs of abating.”</p>
<p class="contents">The report also states that two million Colombians have been displaced and that this year, more people than ever before – 300 000 – have been displaced. It also states that human rights workers, trade unionists, journalists, government investigators and community leaders continue to be murdered because of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we will be voting on a resolution today. I prefer the resolution we voted for last year, which I felt was more balanced, because it noted and clearly condemned the ongoing fumigation of crops and the fact that alternative crops were not being promoted to prevent human disease and the constant attacks on biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year’s resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different, non-militaristic position, which supports the defence of human rights, dialogue and peace. We repeat this demand today and I agree with my fellow Members that this should be done. This resolution also condemned the fact that, since 60% of Colombians live on less than one dollar per day, it is very hard to achieve dialogue, agreements, or peace. This is why, Mr President, I felt that some balance needed to be added to the previous interventions, although I agree with what most of my fellow Members have to say. But it was necessary to mention other parties involved in the war in Colombia, who exert an enormous influence in the absence of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fellow Members have reiterated how much the Colombian people need peace and tranquillity, rather than this type of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we still do not have any news regarding Mrs Bétancour’s situation which could put our minds at rest.

But apart from this, as other speakers have said, we must welcome the statement by President Pastrana, who stated that he wanted to step up his fight against this type of action and provide effective guarantees for the security of the civil society in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly clear that, if President Pastrana leaves the door to negotiations open, then these negotiations must relate to the respect of human rights and restoring order in Colombia so that genuine democracy can finally be established in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore provide greater support for cooperation efforts, which will improve the human rights situation, and it must ensure that the European aid achieves its objective, in other words to assist civil society in Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999. Sadly, for those 400 massacres committed by the government, paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups, not one person was brought to trial. The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups, but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice, we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades. In our individual Member States, and collectively as the European Union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia, which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC. Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting. We, as a democratically elected forum, must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The only way forward we can accept is the peace process which, apart from anything else, is combined with changes urgently needed to Colombian society if it is to avoid going down the same road as Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by President Pastrana is a decision to condone violence. At the same time, apart from anything else, it legitimises action by the paramilitary groups which have murdered so many people in Colombia. Unfortunately, the European Union, together with the United States, is supporting President Pastrana, meaning that it is supporting violence. However, as you and I well know, ladies and gentlemen, violence begets violence, and more violence and yet more violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position has been expressed in numerous statements. The direct role which the individual Member States have played in this respect also deserves recognition here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the proposed support for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota. We have already helped here and we shall continue to offer our help in the future. The Commission is also supporting the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Colombia. The Commission is standing by its commitment to the peace process, hence Commissioner Patten and the Columbian foreign secretary recently signed an agreement on financing initial peace work. We intend to continue supporting Columbian civil society in its efforts to establish peace through regional development and peace programmes. The Commission is currently examining in which specific areas projects can be funded. At the same time, we are offering the victims of the conflict our direct support in the form of humanitarian aid, which is being distributed by ECHO and non-governmental organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
