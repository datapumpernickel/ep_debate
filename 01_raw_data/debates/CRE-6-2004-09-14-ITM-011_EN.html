<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, let me start by saying that the situation in Sudan continues to be a matter of grave concern for the international community. Reports on atrocities indicate the Government of Sudan's inability – and possibly unwillingness – to take the required measures. The world is gradually losing its patience with a government that appears reluctant to assume full responsibility for all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to Darfur as well as to the North-South process. The EU remains firmly committed to assisting Sudan to return to peace and stability as a matter of urgency. Sudan should as soon as possible become a country in which all citizens are free and safe, not dominated by violence and discrimination. The government in Khartoum should be a true government for all Sudanese and assume full responsibility for the well-being of all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">A stable and democratic Sudan is also a requirement for peace and stability in the region as a whole. The continued tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the problems in Somalia, the war in northern Uganda and further afield, and the ongoing crisis in the Great Lakes area are all indications of instability on the African continent. Peace in Sudan would create promising prospects for peace in the wider region. The EU should be ready to support and engage in the Darfur conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we welcome the active role of the African Union in the Sudan crisis. As much as is possible and realistic, the ownership of the solution to the Darfur crisis should rest with Africa itself. Therefore, the EU's support and engagement should, in the first instance, be through coordinating its policies with the African Union. Furthermore, the European Union should align and coordinate with other important players, such as the United Nations, the United States and other international parties, including the Arab League.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the EU's policy on Sudan is focused as follows. First of all, support to the African Union mission in Darfur. Second, support for the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Pronk. Third, pressure on the government and the SPLM to conclude the Naivasha peace process. Fourth, pressure on the Government and the SLM and the JEM to conclude the Abuja peace process. Fifth, coordinating policies and actions with the other international actors. Sixth, provision of humanitarian assistance. Finally, active consideration of further measures to increase the pressure on the parties, including sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for the African Union constitutes a simple element to the EU's Darfur policy. The Dafur crisis has shown that the African Union is prepared to provide leadership in meeting Africa's challenges. The EU is fully behind the African Union. A strong and able African Union is crucial for Africa's future. This applies in particular to conflict prevention, management and a solution of the Darfur issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The African Union has taken two major initiatives. First of all, it has fielded the ceasefire commission which is monitoring the N'Djamena agreement and developments in Darfur and second, it has initiated negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The AU mission is currently staffed by 125 monitors, including monitors from the EU and the United States, and has completed approximately 20 investigations into ceasefire violations. The AU monitoring staff is supported by a protection force of 305, made up of Rwandan and Nigerian troops.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of the African Union, the United Nations has prepared a comprehensive plan on how best to enhance the effectiveness of the AU mission on the ground. The plan envisages an enlarged AU mission to Darfur, with increased numbers of military observers, increased military personnel in the protection force, in the civilian police and civilian support staff. More staff will also be deployed at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa. Depending on how these plans are further elaborated, the EU will consider supporting an enhanced AU mission in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">In Abuja, the Government of Sudan and the rebels have agreed on a humanitarian protocol and a new round of discussions on the security protocol is also envisaged. The European Union has been represented during the first round of negotiations and urges both the government and the rebels to resume the talks with great urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the African Union, the United Nations is an important player in resolving the crisis in Darfur. Secretary-General Annan visited Sudan in July. He reached an agreement with the Government of Sudan on a series of benchmarks laid down in the communiqué of 3 July. These benchmarks serve as a basis for the work of the Joint Implementation Mechanism, which is co-chaired by Special Representative Jan Pronk and the Sudanese Foreign Minister Ismail.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 August, Mr Pronk reached an agreement with the Sudanese Government on a plan of action. The EU supports the action plan but sees Resolution 1556 as the main framework to maintain pressure on the Government of Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the message to the Sudanese authorities should be consistent and straightforward. The more so since in his report to the Security Council of 2 September, Special Representative Pronk acknowledged progress in safety in camps and in humanitarian access, but stressed that the situation in Darfur continues to be very serious. Recent evidence of continued killings of villagers in Darfur in attacks by armed forces and the Janjaweed illustrates how serious the situation remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the presentation by Mr Pronk to the Security Council on 2 September, there have been ongoing discussions on a new Security Council resolution. The European Union is in favour of a strong resolution to maintain pressure on the parties in the Sudan. At the meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday, we discussed preliminary options for sanctions. For the moment, the threat of sanctions is probably the best means to press the Government of Sudan to comply with its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States supports this line also. In a public hearing in the Senate, Secretary of State Powell announced support for the expansion of the AU mission and for the idea of curbing Sudanese military flights over Darfur, and raised the possibility of introducing sanctions. At the same time, he urged the Government of Sudan and the SPLM, as well as the SLM and the JEM, to intensify efforts to conclude negotiations. This coincides with the EU point of view, as stated in our conclusions last Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on humanitarian assistance and the way forward. While access for humanitarian assistance has improved, the humanitarian situation is still critical. Violence may have decreased but the notorious Janjaweed and militia remain active. The security situation is absolutely unsatisfactory and an important indicator for this is that hardly any of the IDPs and refugees are returning to their homes. We once more urgently call on the Government of Sudan to curb the violence, disarm and bring the Janjaweed to justice, and guarantee the safety of civilians outside the camps.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is an important contributor to humanitarian assistance and so far has provided EUR 288 million. Much more is needed and, as Special Representative Pronk indicated in his report, only 50% of the funding requirements of the United Nations response to the Darfur crisis has been met, leaving a funding shortfall of USD 255 million for the Darfur crisis alone. The EU should also make a major contribution to this shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we should prepare for reconstruction in Darfur to be started as soon as the crisis has ended and a comprehensive peace agreement has been signed between North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the way forward. The international community should continue to press for an early political solution to the conflicts that are destroying Sudan. Pressure on the parties to continue both the Naivasha and Abuja processes, support for the AU and the United Nations, humanitarian assistance and the preparedness to apply further measures, including sanctions, are key elements in the EU policy on Sudan. The EU is committed to helping to bring peace and stability to Sudan. The EU works shoulder-to-shoulder with the African Union and the United Nations, but will take its own responsibility based on the Council's conclusions of 12 and 26 July, and of 13 September. Peace in the Sudan is of enormous national significance but it will also have a crucial influence on peace in the region, as I have said. Peace in the Sudan is therefore a central objective of our African policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to address the crisis which has developed in Darfur and for the interest shown by Parliament and the Committee on Development in making this its first mission of this new parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">The mission has returned with a clear picture of a complex situation and has expressed indignation at the terrible events which continue to unfold in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had been actively engaged in delivering humanitarian aid to the western part of Sudan before this crisis became what it has. Things are so terrible now that we have mobilised to date EUR 105 m. This has mostly been spent on basic humanitarian food aid, but we are also trying to support the political process. This amount corresponds to some 37% of what the EU as a whole has contributed. Normally, the Commission's share of support in these humanitarian crises is about 20% of what Member States give in total. I would add here that we see quite a spread when we compare what different Member States have contributed. I mention this because I find the qualitative value of what the EU as a whole is doing in a given situation is related not only to what the Commission is doing or the total amount of what we do, but also to the genuine character of commitment across Europe as a whole in support of our activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also directing money and effort to the situation in Chad, by providing shelter for an estimated 200 000 refuges from Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">In mobilising aid we have been facing persistent administrative blockages from the Government of Sudan and major logistical problems resulting in substantial additional costs. More than 25% of the costs of this operation relates to the logistical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The administrative problems are progressively being solved, in my view thanks to a large extent to the international community's pressure on the Sudanese Government. As to logistics, ECHO is opening a technical antenna in Darfur and another in Chad to improve coordination in the field. They will be operational by the end of this month and we are planning for an initial period of 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still a lot more to do. It is estimated that about 40% of the affected population still has no access to humanitarian aid and, in spite of improvement in some areas, violence, including systematic rape of women, is still being reported. I am aware that the mission has returned with accounts of terrible violence and great fear.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the international community to remain mobilised, as the humanitarian needs will continue for another year, even in the best-case scenario. As we have seen, the effects of these crises continue to be felt and we must organise ourselves to handle them better in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel to humanitarian aid, the EU has been very active in the political sphere. We have mobilised for the first time the EDF-funded African Peace Facility, providing the bigger part of the budget of the mission of the African Union. This has allowed a rapid response from the African Union Peace and Security Council via a decision taken at its first official meeting and following the humanitarian ceasefire agreement in N'Djamena. It has sent some 150 observers and a 300 strong military protection force to monitor the ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the limited scale of this operation, results in the field have been positive. I firmly believe that only an African Union initiative will have the political weight and relevance to oblige the belligerents, and in particular the Government of Sudan, to comply with their commitments. This does not mean that others should not and cannot play a very important role. Partnership and ownership are not incompatible, especially when the partnership is carried out in a professional manner, reflecting the sound principle that visibility is fine but feasibility is better.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that some of the existing weakness of the organisation experienced by the African Union could, and should, be addressed by an enhanced partnership with the United Nations and with the EU as such, including our Member States. However, I appreciate, as the presidency has also today clearly stated, that the African Union has to be in the driving seat. They have to initiate and drive this mission.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the Commission is ready, in liaison with the Member States and if the AU so requests to envisage additional support through the peace facility to a well-planned extension of the AU mission in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">The most urgent objective is clearly to ensure maximum protection for the civilian population. The whole problem of whether or not to return, and what to return to, essentially depends on people's feeling of security in that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be ready to discus with the parties in appropriate fora a possible amendment of the current mandate of the AU mission, if the Government of Sudan is unwilling or unable to effectively protect the population of Darfur. This is a must.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to note that we are facing a real conflict. There is more to this than some disorganised violence. There is not only the problem concerning the Government of Sudan, there are rebel groups fighting for their agendas they do exist.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, all this has to be dealt with through a serious effort to mediate, putting pressure on all the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to emphasise that a sustainable political solution for Darfur necessarily has to be articulated and worked out in parallel with and in relation to the global Naivasha process. A solution for Darfur alone will not solve the wider problem. In fact the problem in Darfur did not come out of the blue, it was a result of the problems in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">A measure of political agreement has been reached in Abuja and that is a good start, but we have to support all forces working to push this in the right direction and at the same time focus on the enormous task of improving the humanitarian situation in the field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My conclusions are as follows: the security situation there is alarming; the political situation has not changed; the Sudanese Government is not willing to take any steps beyond those forced upon it by international political will; the humanitarian situation has improved only slightly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very sorry to state here that only a very short time after 9/11 we have tens of thousands of very poor people living in camps. There is no future for them, nor any way back. Fifty per cent of the population in the camps is under 15 years of age, so we are creating a new generation of deprived people who can only take up Kalashnikovs and become new fundamentalists and new extremists. We have to be very precise in the measures that we take to ensure our individual and common security.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the points to be discussed? The first is the ethnic context. We have seen that there are no Arabs in the camps. Ninety per cent of those to whom we have spoken do not have Arabic as their mother tongue. In Arabic they are called ‘Suda’, the black population. There is massive sexual violence. One sheikh told us that they have to send women out of the camps for food and water because they at least come back, whereas if they send men, they are killed. There is mass killing and a mass expulsion of the population from its camps. This should be stopped immediately. The situation is even more alarming in security terms than in humanitarian terms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to humanitarian aid, it reaches up to 60% of IDPs in the camps. The situation has improved because the Sudanese Government allows NGOs and certain humanitarian organisations to reach the territories under its control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The evidence and the testimonies that we took from the people we spoke to all referred to collaboration between the Janjaweed and the Government of Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">What the people talked about was coordinated violence against them. It was not random violence, it was coordinated by the Janjaweed with the assistance and collusion of the Government of Sudan. We heard of decapitation, burning, brutality, terror and awful suffering from the people that we spoke to. It was only in 1994, when I was in Rwanda, that I ever saw the degree of terror in people's eyes that I saw in those camps in Darfur and in Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to see an effective global arms embargo, an international commission of inquiry; we need targeted sanctions against those, both in government and business, who have been connected with these atrocities and I believe that there should be an oil embargo. 320 000 barrels of oil are produced each day but the benefits of those barrels of oil never reach the people of Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">To both the Commission and the Council I would say that in Al Fasha the African Union expressed no enthusiasm for an increased protection force. They had little coordination with the United Nations or discussion on the plan of action. They called for more monitors and for an international policing and human rights monitoring force. They said they were not able to deal with the current challenges they faced, never mind having to deal with a substantially increased force. They were very clear and very adamant on that.</p>
<p class="contents">To both the Commission and Council I would also say that the plan of action agreed by the UN is leading to the Government of Sudan now deploying forces towards the safe areas, into the rebel areas, and causing immense instability and difficulty. They are contravening the no-fly zone. When we landed in Al Fasha, an attack helicopter was hovering overhead. On our visit to one village, we saw the rockets that had been fired at the people, destroying the village and sending the people scattering into the bush.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to hear no more of 'never again' from anyone in the international community. We have to challenge the Government of Sudan and stop its relentless Orwellian denial of what is happening in its country. The pattern of violence must stop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a result of brutal attacks by the government of Sudan and its allied militia, a quarter of the population of Darfur had fled their homes in terror. Two hundred thousand had crossed over the border into Chad and 1 200 000 are internally displaced within Sudan. Humanitarian access has improved as the Council stated but we were told that one in three is still cut off from assistance because of the rains and the lack of capacity, and because of ongoing clashes between government and rebel forces. This adds up to a situation of enormous fragility. All displaced persons need access to humanitarian aid and they will need it for at least another 18 months because they have not been able to grow crops this year. The worst possible scenario would be for humanitarian assistance to be cut off by renewed fighting or political obstacles. That would leave 1.2 million people facing starvation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the delegation visited Darfur, all the people we spoke to in the camps told us the same thing: they wished to return to their homes but they were terrified of further attacks. There will be no end to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur until people feel safe to return home. That will only happen if there are no more violations of the ceasefire, and if there is a comprehensive political solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a plea that in our discussions we do not get too bogged down on issues such as whether this is or is not genocide in Darfur. Let us concentrate on the actions that this Parliament can take to support the African Union ceasefire monitors and the peace negotiations. If we fail to be practical in this crisis, then we will let down more than one million Sudanese people who are dependent upon us for their survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is useful and essential, however, to be a good fire-fighter, I feel that it is even more essential for us not to lapse into starting fires of our own. I should therefore like to address the subject of access to oil resources, which is becoming increasingly difficult and beset by conflict. It is an issue that has, to terrible effect, been fanning the flames of the situation in Darfur for a number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a familiar scenario: tensions and wars intensify as access to oil resources becomes a source of conflict and a major issue both for a number of international powers and for the local powers. Not only are the USA and Europe – particularly France, which has a major influence in the region – implicated in this situation, but so are China and a number of Asian countries. We are also all aware of the scandal of the misuse of oil revenue, which often serves only to fuel the personal enrichment, corruption and arms purchases that we see today, not to mention the worsening breaches of the human rights of the communities affected, all of this against a backdrop of successive dictatorships that are, in turn, sometimes supported more or less openly by the same people who are today expressing outrage at the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, I feel that the EU has major responsibilities and is duty bound, at world level and thus within the UN, to launch an entirely different energy policy, one that is fair, sustainable and genuinely intended to serve the citizens, and to do so with the help of politicians, oil companies and civil society. We must also step up the fight against financial crime and against tax havens; we must block the financial accounts and the profits of dictators and profiteers of all kinds. We must, of course, offer our solid support for alternative energy policies both at home and in countries such as these, and Europe must also be much more demanding and much more vigilant as regards the support offered by the major providers of international funds to certain oil projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. We must support civil society and the democrats in these countries and, in short, must be able to act diplomatically, politically and economically in a coherent fashion. I feel that this could constitute an essential and even priority task for the future representative of a strong common foreign policy – a policy that we all wish very much to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They want to go back to their villages, hundreds of which have been destroyed, but they want to go back in safety. They are therefore asking the international community for a greater presence. They do not trust the Sudanese Government and are calling for justice to be done and for the crimes against them not to go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing an immense tragedy – a million displaced persons, 200 000 refugees, 30 000 dead – faced with which the international community intervened very late in calling for a cease-fire and the opening of peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the camps we visited we did not see anyone dying of starvation. Emergency aid has arrived except in the rebel-held areas, which the humanitarian aid convoys cannot reach because of the rains, which is why there is no complete check on the conditions there. Even in the areas that the war has not touched, however, we saw immense poverty. Many Sudanese or Chadian citizens are registering as displaced persons or refugees in order to get food and medical care. Indeed, the Darfur democratic opposition groups that we met, whether they were African or Afro-Arab communities, agreed that the armed conflict begun by the SLA or JEM forces was rooted in underdevelopment and a policy aimed at marginalising the region, specifically the African communities. The danger that violence might break out again is always present. If the causes are not removed, it may not just be Darfur that explodes.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is essential for the European Union to push for positive results from the Abuja negotiations. We must put pressure on the Sudanese Government and the SLA or JEM forces to observe the cease-fire and, as you yourself said, we must cooperate especially in strengthening the presence of African Union forces and human rights observers. We must also help those parts of civil society that uphold human and social rights to put across their message more strongly. I also believe it is vital to take the Naivasha agreements forward and to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">As many people in Sudan told us, the only possible solution is a political one; it cannot be by military means. That is why I believe a strict arms embargo needs to be imposed on Sudan not only by the European Union but also by the United Nations, just as strong pressure also needs to be put on Eritrea or anyone who sells arms to the rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">These are difficult times, because war and terrorism are destroying our lives. I believe we have to act wisely and with determination so that the people of Sudan can move on towards development and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the UN’s international organisation, WHO, approximately 10 000 people are dying every month in the refugee camps in Darfur in Western Sudan. Most of these are children.</p>
<p class="contents">The surrounding world is aware of what is happening in Sudan but, in spite of this, is powerless to act faced with this humanitarian tragedy. We agree that the surrounding world must act immediately. The issue is, however, that of how the conflict is best to be resolved. It is important to bear two principles in mind. Firstly, that of broad international support and, secondly, that of respect for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Intervention in Sudan must be based on a UN mandate, affording the greatest possible international support. The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union. The action would thus have the support of the African countries, which would facilitate a lasting solution. One UN organisation that could be used is, for example, the multinational force, SHIRBRIG. This intervention force was one of the UN actors in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Military intervention by the EU would be in danger of making it more difficult to conduct a successful UN intervention. The plans for an EU intervention in the Sudan conflict also give the impression of being a springboard for the creation of an EU army able to act without a UN mandate. The EU Constitution makes it possible for the EU to intervene in conflicts without UN support. This would be in danger of weakening international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Action within the framework of the UN is the best prior condition for creating broad international support for resolving the conflict. In that way, the intervention would also take place within the framework of international law. The solution to the conflict would thus be more legitimate and more sustainable.

This is the opinion of many international human rights organisations, including International Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that many camps in the western region of Darfur in Sudan are still in control of both the Janjaweed armed militia and the Sudanese Government. That is simply an intolerable situation. The agencies must be given free and unencumbered access to these camps. That is not the case at the moment. Many aid agencies are working in very difficult situations.</p>
<p class="contents">This too is the view of members of the Committee on Development who recently travelled to the Darfur region on a fact-finding mission on behalf of the European Parliament. We heard this afternoon from many of those who were on that mission. I congratulate them for undertaking it and for bringing their reports back. I look forward to the next meeting of the committee. I am sure we will hear in more detail about what they heard and saw.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one of the best ways forward is to engage more African Union troops to act as peace-keepers in the Darfur region. That would also help to ensure that we could put in place an African solution to an African problem. Up until now we have not been able to achieve this because there are not enough African Union troops on the ground who could enforce a ceasefire. The Sudanese Government has, for the most part, imposed stalling tactics, which has resulted in the small numbers of African Union peace-keepers being denied access to all regions around Darfur. The Sudanese Government has said that there are enormous difficulties and that it needs more time; but as one of the earlier speakers said, is the government unable to carry out what we have asked it to do, or is it reluctant? The more one listens to people - whether it is aid agencies or members of our Committee on Development or other groups - who have been out there and have seen first hand what is going on, one has to say that there is a total lack of commitment to do anything about the violence that is happening on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the strong role that the European Union has played in providing humanitarian aid to the people of Sudan. Its value is in excess of EUR 400 million this year. The European Union will continue to be the largest donor of international aid to Sudan for some time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sudanese Government must now realise the clear challenge that it faces. It must fully meet its international responsibilities and its responsibilities to its own people, or face further international condemnation in the form of sanctions. The European Union, together with the United Nations, should seriously consider imposing a global arms embargo on Sudan. This would play a constructive role in helping to cut off military supplies to both the Sudanese Government and the Janjaweed armed militia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demands immediate action. It is the world's largest current humanitarian crisis. It has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people inside Sudan, over 200 000 people into neighbouring Chad and the number of civilian deaths has risen to almost 50 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The government in Khartoum has armed the militia group, the Janjaweed, to attack the non-Arab-speaking civilian population and supported them with rocket attacks by helicopter, Antonov and MiG planes. The bombardment of villagers and systematic rape have terrorised the population and caused a serious humanitarian crisis which will escalate with the arrival of the rainy season.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has accepted that genocide is now being committed and this brings into place a whole new series of legislative measures for us, including activating the United Nations Security Council to authorise the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to Sudan to arrest and punish the perpetrators of these terrible war crimes, whether or not Sudan fails to exercise its sovereign jurisdiction or sign the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite humanitarian aid, refugee camps are currently witnessing around 100 000 deaths per month due to dysentery and the atmosphere of insecurity. The crisis could lead to a further genocide. We must show that this is not Rwanda, that we now know how to react to this type of crisis in order to save human lives as we demonstrated in Congo. Every day the situation worsens. For this reason, we must pressurise the Sudanese Government to honour its commitment made on 3 July to enable the flow of humanitarian aid. Khartoum also needs to accept the deployment of international observers from the African Union and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The cease-fire agreement should be respected. Military aircraft should be grounded in Darfur and the disarmament process of the militia speeded up. The UN should impose a global arms embargo on Sudan. The government, Chad, Libya and the Central African Republic should rigidly control the trade in small arms in the region and the African Union should establish an international police force. We must finally act to put an end to this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people of Darfur have been involved in an uprising, not for separatist claims, but against the under-development and political and economic marginalisation to which they have been subjected by Khartoum, which has been fomenting inter-ethnic conflict since the 1980s. We are not dealing with a government that is reluctant to carry out its responsibilities, but with a dictatorial government that spends over half of the State budget on ‘Migs’ and other military supplies, and does not invest the profits from oil in helping the Sudanese people. It is a regime that is accustomed to living with sanctions, adept at exploiting the rivalries within the international community and capable of mobilising countries to which it sells oil or from which it purchases arms, such as China and Pakistan, under the protection of the Security Council. It is a government that realises that there is no political will, when permanent members of the Security Council use words like genocide to describe what is happening in Darfur and do not act immediately with adequate resources to stop it with anything more than words. The Sudanese Government is therefore only partly meeting its obligations under Resolution 1556, but has not met the key obligation, which is to put an end to the war that it is waging on its people in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">The African Union is undertaking a mission that is worthy of the European Union’s praise and support. More must be done as regards logistical and military capability; more needs to be done to assist coordination between the African Union and the United Nations; more needs to be done in terms of the rapid support provided to the humanitarian organisations and to the humanitarian agencies on the ground. It is essential that we increase the international presence on the ground, with both African Union ceasefire monitors and peace-keeping forces, and the humanitarian agencies, human rights monitors and an international police force. There must also be a clear mandate from the Security Council to protect the civil population at risk. This is what all of the refugees and displaced persons with whom Parliament’s mission spoke asked us to do. EU governments both inside and outside the Security Council have a particular responsibility to deliver a coherent message to the Sudanese Government, which, at its core, is weak, ridden with rivalries, dictatorial and corrupt. If Parliament and European governments think that the situation ‘amounts to genocide’, then the very least that they can do is recommend an arms embargo and an oil embargo. This is the only language that the Sudanese Government understands. The EU and the entire international community must demand that the ceasefire be enforced and must demand that the present agreement be extended to all regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in September 2004, and this delayed reaction is not due to the fact that we did not know. Let us just think of how few doors we have knocked on in all these months. We have reacted late because of a political calculation that proved to be wrong, which was to focus everything on the Naivasha process, and therefore Khartoum thought it had <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to intervene elsewhere. I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that major tensions are exploding in eastern Sudan, and I should not like us to react in a year’s time once it has turned into an inextricable crisis. It is a complex problem which, in my opinion, should be tackled as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, with regard to security, there is the problem of a real atmosphere of impunity. I should like to remind the Presidency and the Commission of the existence of an instrument, namely the International Criminal Court and in particular Article 7 of the Statute, on the basis of which the Security Council can ask the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation. I mention this because, alongside the Commission on Human Rights, this is an instrument on which Europe has worked so hard that I believe it can and must be brought into play in this particular crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again we are witnessing a humanitarian drama which, in truth, disguises a political drama. It is this drama which must be dealt with: a humanitarian emergency, which could be even worse, is yet to come. According to the calculations of many NGOs, between 100 000 and 350 000 people may die as a result of a generalised famine.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore take quick measures and I am therefore also happy that both the Council and the Commission are taking measures in this regard. We must continue with humanitarian aid, we must put pressure on the government of Khartoum to disarm the militias and if this means sanctions are needed, they must be imposed. The number of international observers must also be increased, and they must specifically be African.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to the importance of emphasising the need to deal with the causes, of political origin, which relate to the poverty of the country, which relate to having allowed the authoritarian regime in Khartoum to exist for many years and which furthermore have allowed, amongst other things, while we remained silent, European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain and Cyprus to export arms to that country, violating the code of conduct on arms, and we must therefore meet the need to review this process and once again demand that the United Nations enforce a complete embargo in relation to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of people killed in and around Darfur is currently estimated at 50 000, and more than a million people are on the run. The Arab militiamen who are responsible for these atrocities are given free play by the Islamic Government, which has a crushing responsibility for the events that are now unfolding. According to Mr Pronk, the UN special envoy in Sudan, the Sudanese Government is cooperating in good faith, but, and I quote ‘the agreements on the ground are not yet applied in Darfur’. The question is what should actually happen in order for there to be clear condemnation of the Islamic regime in Sudan. The Commission is similarly grappling with this politically correct diffidence. So far, the Council and the Commission have been extremely reserved, not to mention lukewarm, in their reactions to the events in Sudan. It is therefore time that bold sanctions were taken, such as for example an oil embargo, together with all other necessary measures, in order to put a stop to the violence in Sudan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I have not been a member of the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> committee, and do not have relevant experience in this area, one thing that has become clear to me so far from this debate is that the crisis is following the same pattern as all such crises. We react too late and not forcefully or coherently enough. This makes it possible for genocide to continue unpunished, and for a government which bears responsibility for this ongoing massacre simply not to take us seriously. Even if there could be no question of conflict prevention, it is still essential for damage limitation to take place at least now, and for international pressure to be stepped up by the coordinated action of the EU, the USA, the UN and the OAU, so that a stop is put to this genocide. The deployment of more African Union troops should be made possible, the International Court of Justice should be able to take action, and, above all, I believe that we should not only toy with the idea of sanctions, but come to see them as a genuine alternative. This means sanctions of any kind, which will force the Khartoum Government to abandon the cynicism which they show in their dealings with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A government which nods diplomatically in agreement with the international community and politely listens to its requests, but meanwhile accepts the Janjaweed militiamen in its own army, while the killing and raping continues as before. It is apparent that this government is prepared to conclude real peace agreements only if there is a real threat, and the willingness to realise this threat is being illustrated. In southern Sudan, we saw that the oil boycott threat worked with this government. Last week in the European Parliament, Mrs Van Ardenne stated that she considers the oil boycott as one of the measures to put the government under pressure. In the Security Council, Europe, together with the African Union and the United States, must continually and unanimously press home that either the Sudanese Government must observe the agreements with Kofi Annan or else that a specific oil boycott will be introduced which is irrevocably proclaimed via the Security Council. The question that many are left with is: will these remain just words, and does the Sudanese Government meanwhile have little to fear, or are we prepared to actually see this matter through via the Security Council? I truly hope that there is strength in unity in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The USA is now accusing the Khartoum Government of genocide by its proxy Janjaweed Arab militiamen against African local tribes, who rose up in February 2003 against the government. The government is said to be dominated by only two ethnic Arab tribes, who have excluded the Sudanese Africans from power and the sharing of Sudan's oil wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">This a complex dispute, with the Justice and Equality Movement through its 'Black Book', circulated in Khartoum last year, calling for more democracy but from a radical Islamist perspective. The hands of Dr al-Turabi seem to be at work in Darfur, settling scores against President Bashir, responsible for expelling Osama Bin Laden from Sudan in 1996. It must also be said that the rebels have been brutal in their attacks on Sudanese Government workers, in particular policemen.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN has now promised a review and Washington is calling for a UN commission of inquiry and for consideration of trade sanctions, including arms and an oil embargo. The EU will probably follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, no one in the EU wants direct military intervention, but only supports the continued presence of African Union troops as monitors and possibly as peacekeepers. The UN and EU sanctions may be very difficult to enforce in such a vast country as Sudan, especially with the recent large investments in the oil sector by China and India, which would be negatively affected. Recent reports of the Janjaweed, who have razed 405 villages to the ground and continue to wreak havoc, including the systematic raping of women, claim they have been disgracefully integrated into Sudan's military.</p>
<p class="contents">Something must be done, as Sudan is just emerging from the long civil war in the south. However, with the lessons of Iraq in mind, no western power, to my mind, will contemplate military intervention.

The Sudanese Government is cunningly playing for time in order to gain a unilateral advantage, while also benefiting from the difficult international situation that sees the supranational institutions and the whole of public opinion concentrating on the fight against global terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament therefore needs to pass a new resolution, which must include a demand for a total arms embargo as well as selective sanctions that can put pressure on the government and the armed forces without hurting the civilian population.

We are following the situation very closely and I share your concerns. I have listened very carefully to the suggestions you have made and to your calls for action.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those speakers who have stressed the fact that what we need is a political solution, not a military solution. Military force would only lead to further bloodshed and we want to avoid that. It is in that context that we believe that the African Union, which has taken the lead, should continue to be in the driver's seat. At the same time, however, we see how important it is that a cohesive and coherent effort be undertaken so that the African Union, together with the United Nations, the European Union and the United States, exert increasing pressure on the Sudanese Government as we have done from the beginning - notably as the Dutch Government, but also as the European Union over these past months.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also continue to push the African Union to implement the suggestions that have been made by the United Nations. I listed a number of possibilities: increase the number of observers, increase the military force supporting these observers, increase the civilian presence, send a police force even a European Union police force, if the African Union asks for one. It is very important that we cooperate very closely and that the African Union tries to find an African solution to an African problem. We must lend all the support we can muster.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should follow a twin-track approach on the calls for action. On the one hand, I share the feelings of all those who have said that continued, strong diplomatic pressure on the government of Sudan is an absolute requirement. We have done this and will continue to do so in the context of the meetings we have. For example, next week we have a meeting the United Nations. I have also met with ministers: at the end of July I invited Minister Ismail to the Netherlands. There was a strong exchange of words on the situation. Promises were made, but as we have seen they were not kept. That is why there should also be another track, and that track, as many of you have said, consists of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is currently examining all the possibilities for imposing sanctions very carefully, but we think that sanctions should be effective. They should really hit the government and they should also be all-encompassing, so, together with the Commission and the Council secretariat, we are drafting a comprehensive review of which sanctions are possible. Among those sanctions, we are considering an oil boycott, an arms embargo and many other possibilities to make it crystal clear to the Sudanese Government that we mean business.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand as Commissioner Nielson mentioned we should not forget that humanitarian aid is of the essence. If one talks to Mr Lubbers or Mr Pronk as I have recently it is very obvious that one aspect is the situation in respect of the Sudanese Government. The other aspect pertains to the humanitarian aid situation, which is terrible at the moment. There too, the European Union is doing everything it can.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mrs Bonino's suggestion on the International Criminal Court is concerned, you will understand that I wholeheartedly agree with this. The International Criminal Court with its seat in the Hague is something we endorse whenever we can. However, we should not forget that what we need first, in the United Nations, is to discuss the situation on the basis of Mr Pronk's report. Subsequently, the United Nations Security Council should make a request, and then we can act to initiate proceedings in the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only repeat that we are very concerned about the situation. We take everything you have said into account and take it very seriously. We are deeply aware of the suffering of the people there and of what has happened. Whether you call it genocide or not, the situation is very serious. We have to be willing to take action. In the meantime, we are waiting for the outcome of the discussions that are to take place shortly in the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is very serious: rushing to use certain words, and acting and speaking as if these words are the actual facts, is not the way to clarify to the public that what we see is unacceptable and has to be stopped. Taking that step and using certain terminology at this stage can be, in my opinion, problematic. We need to establish the facts, and I expect this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk here that myself and others are seen to be taking this matter too lightly. Even with that risk, I would like to make the point that in relation to the tradition of impunity in these matters, I find it important that the African Union has been encouraged to do something and is not sitting passively waiting for the government to comply. The African Union is totally publicly committed to putting pressure on the government, and at the moment is making an effort to increase its engagement in Darfur, both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the mandate. This needs to be supported. It is a new experience for the so-called international community to be able to relate to and support something like this, which we have never encountered before in an African crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to do more. The UN's role is absolutely essential. The commitment throughout Africa, via the African Union, to use the newly created Peace and Security Council has created a basis for the UN to act. Without this there would have been little grounds for optimism. Even that word is perhaps out of place in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do to exert maximum pressure? I still have not signed the country strategy paper for Sudan. More than EUR 400 million is available via unspent funds – which could not be used for normal development cooperation activities during the many years of fighting between north and south – and new money from the ninth EDF. This large amount of money cannot be made available until we see a comprehensive peace agreement. It is a political fact of life, which comes as no surprise anywhere not here and not in Khartoum that the situation in Darfur must be seen as part of any definition of peace in the country. This pressure is a major element in our effort to push things in a better direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming year we will face not only the demands relating to humanitarian aid, but we will also have to prepare to secure the livelihoods of the people whom we hope to assist in returning to their homes as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
