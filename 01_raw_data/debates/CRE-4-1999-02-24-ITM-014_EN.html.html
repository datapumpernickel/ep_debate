<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Grossetête </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, I would first like to directly address a question to the Commission, as there are a number of rumours flying around. I have reason to believe that certain manoeuvres have been undertaken and I would like to ask the Commission whether it is true that it is preparing a proposal that would encompass the directive with which we are concerned. If there is indeed a new proposal that we are to discuss in the near future, I would like to know if it really covers the directive that we are discussing this evening. If that is the case, depending on the Commission"s answers, I will decide what attitude to adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, to come back to the main issues of this directive, I would like to point out that an initial examination took place in October 1997, and that work was suspended while awaiting precise answers from the Commission; however, having obtained those answers, after several months" delay, we were not satisfied. Without an active contribution from the Commission, I was finally forced to make a different proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was proposing two new symbols indicating the recyclability and reusability of packaging waste. However, these two symbols are completely new and do not provide sufficient information for the consumer. As the Commission itself recognises, recycling systems do not by any means cover the whole of Europe. We are now aware that the 1994 directive on packaging and packaging waste is not correctly applied across the whole of Europe. I therefore felt it was preferable to provide consumers with information which would allow them to be really active individually. Consumers must actively participate in the sorting of this packaging waste on the basis of symbols, which are already well‐known, indicating the nature of the packaging material. This should help them in individual sorting. The symbols were chosen through the work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was concerned about the appropriateness of these symbols, and I can reassure them as all of the symbols are in the public domain. I even know that certain companies have taken the trouble to write to the Commission in order to inform them that their symbols were at its disposal. The Commission"s proposal also envisages a conformity assessment procedure for evaluating whether packaging conforms to the main requirements of the 1994 directive on packaging. It says that the manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity, establish technical documentation and keep it at the disposal of the national authorities that will carry out the necessary inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the packaging sector is particularly complex and often involves a great number of professionals. In order to take account of this situation, I believed it was necessary to alter the text of Annex III to avoid any confusion for the packaging manufacturer and the product manufacturer, in other words not to force the manufacturer of the product contained in the packaging to take responsibility for any fault in the packaging. The aim of this is to take into account the responsibility of each party at their stage of contribution to production: the packaging manufacturer, the filler and the packer. I also had discussions with Mr Bowe, and we found common ground which is set out in Amendments Nos 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to point out that the approach that I am proposing, which should enable us to find an intermediary solution while we are waiting for the latest revision of the 1994 packaging directive, is supported by all of the packaging sectors and by the consumers" associations, and it seems that the majority of Member States will agree to it. This is why I maintain my proposal and, while, of course, awaiting the debate, I hope to hear precise answers from the Commission, to which I addressed a question at the beginning of my speech.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Riis‐Jørgensen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span><span class="italic"> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (DA)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have had the pleasure of serving as draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, where I have looked at the consequences of this proposal for a directive. I have the following comments to make. To begin with, I would point out that barriers to trade may arise with regard to partners outside the Community if a separate European reusability label is adopted. As I see it, an international label would have more impact and would not give rise to barriers to trade. It seems to me inappropriate to ask firms in Europe to spend money on introducing a European label if they will subsequently have to change over to an international one. Of course, the labelling scheme is voluntary, but it still has to be seen as a marketing ‘carrot' or advantage to make use of the Commission's proposed label. According to what I have heard, the ISO will already have a label ready for the summer of 1999, in other words in a few months' time. And what is actually the point of the Commission's proposal? The Commission's proposed label is not linked to a European collection scheme, which would justify the label"s message that the material on which it is used is more environmentally friendly. For example, packaging which contains PVC could, according to my information, be labelled as recyclable. Consumers would interpret that as an indication of benefit to the environment, although the packaging in question would in Denmark perhaps go for incineration and not for more environmentally friendly recycling. No, against that background, I do not see anything that justifies the Commission's proposed labelling or the Commission's timing. I therefore have no objection to waiting for an ISO label.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I have a few comments to make on the essential requirements. When we look at the Commission's choice of conformity procedure, I grant that the Commission has made a wise choice. Internal production control is welcomed by industry, since it can be incorporated into existing control systems for quality, the environment and health. But internal production control is based on the essential requirements of the packaging directive, Directive 94/62. These requirements seem to be too weakly defined. This is a view we have heard from industrial circles, but also from the national control authorities. It serves no good purpose for our firms to spend time and money unnecessarily because they are in doubt as to whether they are complying with the EU legislation. Similarly, it is not a good idea to leave the interpretation of these essential requirements to the national control authorities, with all the possibilities which that could entail in the form of technical barriers to trade and distortion of competition between the Member States. So, although I support the Commission's proposal for internal production control, I do not think it would be right to take this proposed directive any further before the essential requirements have been laid down in CEN standards. The Commission has itself admitted in our committee and in the Environment Committee that this proposal was put together in haste and is not as well thought through as might have been wished. I therefore believe, as our committee has concluded, that the only correct thing to do would be to hold the Commission to its responsibility and ask it to withdraw the proposal until the CEN and ISO have completed their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment briefly on Mrs Grossetête's report. In the Liberal Group, we are very much in support of the proposed material identifications. The labelling scheme proposed by the rapporteur gives consumers real information and involves them in a positive way in relation to the environment. When consumers have to make a purchasing decision, they themselves can choose the type of packaging they prefer, and – most importantly of all – consumers are in a better position to sort the packaging waste. This information and this involvement of consumers generates a real, active and positive environmental effect.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gillis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report. I welcome attempts to harmonise the management of packaging waste while recognising the high initial cost of putting in place schemes for recovery, recycling and sorting of waste. The long‐term benefits far outweigh these costs and will lead to a considerable reduction, if not total elimination, of the use of landfill as a waste disposal solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take the long‐term view when dealing with the disposal of packaging waste. Manufacturers must be encouraged to use far less packaging material. Quite often, for example, supermarket goods are wrapped several times. Marking symbols used on packaging to indicate in which category the waste belongs must not only be clear and easily understood but must use the same marking symbols and same colours right across the EU. Furthermore, bags and containers used for waste selection must also use the same colour codes and symbols in all the EU member countries. This is not the case at present.</p>
<p class="contents">For serious package waste management to be successful such symbols must be easily identifiable by the consumer. Consumers will only participate in sorting and recovery schemes if they are simple to manage and if good collection of separated waste bags is available. Modern households living in confined spaces do not have room for holding or stockpiling waste for long periods. Children are naturally concerned about their environment. If they can be encouraged to give their support by starting their training in schools, the good practice will be continued in the home. The key message for success is to keep it simple. Otherwise it will fail.</p>

But we know that the Commission proposal is already obsolete, and it is now absolutely vital to wait for the Commission to revise the basic directive, the packaging directive of 1994, and incorporate its ideas and proposals for the marking of packaging accordingly. The Green Group intends to vote against this report, as, technically speaking, it would seem to be the only way to get the Commission to withdraw this obsolete proposal. Excellent though the work of Mrs Grossetête has been, I believe the only rational alternative is to get the Commission to withdraw its proposal.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the challenge is how to encourage the European consumer to sort packaging waste. I think the efforts of the Commission and the rapporteur to that end are well‐intentioned, but will not achieve the desired effect. The Commission"s proposal would mean that each Member State had to replace its marking symbols with European ones. I would not mind that if the markings were better, but in my opinion they are not. Given that there is no uniform collection system, all the proposed markings do is indicate that the product can be recycled. The sense of that escapes me. I would prefer, for example, the various Dutch symbols whose meaning is crystal‐clear and which fit in with the Dutch system of collection.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals put forward by the rapporteur will not encourage the consumer either. She suggests indicating the type of packaging. This would use voluntary marking, but one form of marking only. The producer could not use any other form. So the Dutch bottle bank symbol, for example, would have to go. I do not think we are making it easy for the consumer if he has to decide for himself from a list of packaging ingredients how he should sort his waste.</p>
<p class="contents">But I acknowledge that there are wide differences between the Member States in how packaging waste is collected. They do not all attach the same importance to environmentally friendly methods of collection. However, I think the solutions suggested by the Commission and the rapporteur are inadequate. There is a very real danger that they may be counter‐productive. If accepted, these proposals may be very confusing to consumers not only in the Netherlands, but in other Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, if we want to provide an incentive for consumers, we must encourage the Member States to make serious efforts to set up an environmentally friendly system of collection. Until we have a uniform system of this kind, I see no point in harmonising markings.</p>

We support the development of all these methods of recovery and re‐use, as the considerable development of the role played by packaging, with its functions of protection, safety, logistics, and especially of aiding marketing, means that we need to deal with the growing environmental burden it represents, without ignoring any procedure that could be useful. We will therefore vote in favour of all the amendments that have been tabled, except for Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 15 from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject Amendment No 13, because by specifying that packaging and packaging waste must be treated according to their marking, it favours one waste‐management system over the others. We need all of these systems. Some people want to give priority to recycling and re‐use of packaging, to the detriment of energy recovery: this approach is contrary to an integrated management of packaging and its waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 12 and 15 place all the responsibility for the conformity assessment procedure for packaging on the processor, and exonerate the packaging manufacturer from all responsibility: under the polluter pays principle, it is the packaging manufacturer who should be responsible for this procedure, not the packer. Moreover, it is much easier to monitor the packaging manufacturers, as they are much fewer in number than the processors: if we take the wine sector as an example, in France there are only a few bottle manufacturers for more than 30 000 bottlers, and this example is typical.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, if these three amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which we feel distort the nature of our colleague"s report, are rejected, we will vote in favour of Mrs Grossetête"s report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has put labelling of packaging on the agenda for today. As you all know, the Commission adopted this proposal back in 1996, and I would like to thank the Environment Committee and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, for the report. The reason why the Commission has presented this proposal is the obligation contained in Article 8 of Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste, which many speakers have also mentioned. Article 8 states: ‘The Council shall... decide no later than two years after the entry into force of this Directive on the marking of packaging'. I realise that there has been some criticism, especially of the new symbols the Commission is introducing under the proposal. The intention of the symbols is to indicate to consumers that the packaging can be reused or recycled. However, the symbols are not meant to give any kind of assurance that the packaging will be reused or recycled, and that is clearly a problem. I was interested to see the report adopted by the Environment Committee. The proposed amendments – and this has also been made clear by the rapporteur herself – will completely alter the Commission's proposal. They will in fact turn it into a proposal on material identification. The symbols proposed by the rapporteur aim to inform the consumer on the packaging material. The symbols for aluminium, glass and plastic, however, also show ‘chasing' arrows, thus indicating to the consumer that the materials are recyclable, and in this way could give misleading information.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a further problem, in that we already have a Commission decision on material identification, Decision No 97/129, which was adopted on 28 January 1997. This establishes identification systems for packaging materials. Specific identification systems were introduced in the form of figures and abbreviations, applicable to plastics, paper, cardboard, metal, wood, textiles, glass and composites. The use of the identification system is voluntary. Under Article 3 of the Commission Decision, however, the system can be made compulsory. The proposed change from a labelling system for reusability and recyclability to one which serves as an identification system will not provide any value added in relation to the current Commission decision. For that reason – and this will hardly come as any surprise to the House – I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 11, 13 or 14, nor can I accept Amendments Nos 16 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important aspect to the Commission proposal, and that concerns the procedure for the assessment of conformity. I would stress that there is an acute need for a procedure for conformity assessment, among both manufacturers and authorities, in order to check conformity with the essential requirements of Directive 94/62. I fully support Amendment No 12, which stipulates that all packaging must have undergone a conformity assessment procedure before it is put onto the market. Amendments Nos 2 and 21 are also acceptable, since they clarify and complement the proposal. It is important to stress that it is the manufacturer who is responsible for undertaking conformity assessments. I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 14 or Amendments Nos 19 and 20. Shared responsibility is not possible when conformity assessment procedures are to be implemented. The packaging manufacturer must ensure that the packaging produced and marketed is in conformity with the requirements of the packaging directive, i.e. Directive 94/62.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me stress again that I do not believe that consumers, manufacturers, authorities or the environment will gain any value added by turning this proposal into a proposal on voluntary material identification.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête began by asking me a direct question, namely whether the Commission was already working on a new proposal. It is not. What may possibly have given rise to the rumours is that we have started discussions on a revision of the packaging directive, but we are still at a very, very early stage in those discussions, so it would be wrong to give the impression that we had a new proposal.</p>
