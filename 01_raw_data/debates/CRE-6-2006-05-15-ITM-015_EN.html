<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen’s initiative towards bringing about a marked improvement in European lawmaking, which will involve withdrawing 68 pending legislative proposals, hits the mark in no uncertain fashion. Public opinion in our own Member States has for some considerable time regarded the European Union as far too bureaucratic and as possessed of a mania for regulation, and so the time for facing up to this justified criticism is already overdue. At the end of the day, the bottom line is that the ‘less, but of better quality’ approach can bring dividends, and it would certainly be good for Europe and for its citizens, and so, Commissioner, with this approach to policymaking, you have the European Parliament – the directly elected representatives of the public – wholeheartedly and unreservedly alongside you, and I would add that it is not just the Commission, but also this House, that has work to do in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of my report, though, Commissioner, is not on the ‘whether’ but on the ‘how’; it has to do, firstly, with the question of how the Commission and Parliament work together as institutions, and, secondly, with the question of whether it takes Parliament’s legislative role sufficiently into account. As you know, the Commission’s announcement that pending legislative proposals would be withdrawn or amended was the cause of some excitement in our House, and not just from an institutional point of view. This House’s committees subjected the specific individual proposals to close examination, the upshot of which was an exchange of letters on the subject between the Presidents of our two institutions. In the case of certain of the proposals, Parliament does not share the Commission’s view, but the Commission has not changed its mind.</p>
<p class="contents">It was almost exactly a year ago that Parliament and the Commission adopted a framework agreement that renewed the basis on which our two institutions work together, and so the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has examined not only the package you have announced in terms of its impact on the Treaties, but also, of course, the framework agreement itself, notably points 31, 32, and 33. Believing as we do that there is a need for legislation over and above the framework agreement, it is our expectation that the Commission will not turn a deaf ear to our proposals, but will instead endorse them in a spirit of sincere cooperation with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing that has to be said is that it has become apparent from the whole affair that the agreement, which has generally been held to, that our House should be informed in advance of the Commission’s intentions, is just not enough. We must not only be informed in advance, but also informed in good time, and what that means is that Parliament should be in a position to do more than just give an opinion on the proposed withdrawal of proposals. The main thing we expect from this is that proper account should be taken of our opinion when the Commission takes its final decision; if, for compelling reasons, the Commission’s decision differs from our own, then we take it as read that we will at least be given an explanation as to why.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why – secondly – the Commission must, in future, go about things in a different way, by adopting the discontinuity principle as practised at the national level. Every newly-appointed Commission should, immediately after taking office, draw up a list of the legislative proposals produced by its predecessor indicating which of the pending proposals it is planning to keep. There should also be an indication in the annual legislative and working programme of which of the proposals currently going through the lawmaking process are to be withdrawn or amended.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as part of the present streamlining initiative, a package was submitted, containing both a list of proposals and an explanation of the package itself. Quite apart from the fact that I myself cannot see why the criterion of competitiveness should be declared to be an overriding principle and virtually ennobled, I want, in my role as rapporteur, to stress that an explanation of the package is precisely what we do not want in future, for it was the explanation of the package that was the cause of a certain amount of irritation, since it cannot be one of Parliament’s functions to explore the Commission’s thinking and match the principles set out in the explanation to the various proposals to which they relate; that is precisely what the Commission is supposed to do when it announces its intention of withdrawing or modifying certain proposals, and that is why we want, in future, to see every single proposal for withdrawal justified separately. I can tell the Commissioner that it is not only important from our point of view that this practice be adopted; I also think it would be beneficial to the Commission, for, if you had explained your proposals one by one and item by item, I am sure you would not have got tangled up in the undergrowth of your own institution. You would then not have announced the withdrawal of the proposal for the Council resolution approving the European Community’s accession to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, without having already noticed that it had already been adopted. You can find it in the Official Journal, L 30, for the year 2005. The Commission really does not possess the authority to declare null and void laws that have already been adopted. If you had checked them one by one, you would not have announced the withdrawal of proposals that had already been withdrawn, for it is to be presumed that you would have noticed the mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">My report has to do with the way in which our two institutions work together, an area in which little is laid down by the Treaty on the European Communities, which, I might add, gives the institutions in question – us in Parliament and in the Commission – discretion to determine the manner of their cooperation in a responsible way. It is my hope that my report will help to improve the EU’s institutional structures and to promote the duty of sincere cooperation between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their good cooperation, which has made it possible for us to present this report without dissent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am most obliged to Mrs Kaufmann for having said that, considered from the political point of view, this project enjoys your House’s wholehearted support; although the debate we have just had has made that clear to me, it was important that it should be confirmed. I will also readily concede that there was room for improvement in the test run that we are discussing today, and I am quite sure that the Commission will accept many of the suggestions you have made in your report. I do not think that we will, in future, have any more grounds for complaint about cooperation in this matter.</p>

Current legislative procedures have been reviewed in the light of the new considerations and priorities that have recently emerged. What happened before they did so? This Commission is concentrating its efforts on a strategy for growth and employment, and what we wanted to know was whether the proposals that were already on the table were congruent with this strategy’s objectives and priorities. Mrs Kaufmann will be aware that the problem with many of these proposals was that no assessment whatever of their eventual impact had been carried out, even though it was to be expected that some of them would have a massive effect on the economy. That is the second argument, for the Commission had in fact, in the previous year, already decided that no more proposals would be put forward without a broad-based and methodologically sound means of assessing their impact, and it was with this, too, in mind that the proposals were reviewed to determine whether they would be equal to the demands for quality lawmaking that we had newly devised.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, too, there was also the question of whether specific proposals still stood a chance of being adopted, and that brings me to the point that you so rightly addressed. There were a number of proposals in respect of which your House did not share the Commission’s view, for example where the legal status of association and companies on a mutual basis is concerned, proposals in respect of which have been lying around in the Council for twelve years without the least thing being done with them. There is not the remotest indication of the Council actually wanting to do anything with these proposals, and one cannot but wonder whether they are perhaps unlikely to survive the political process, and whether one perhaps ought to think again and come up with something better.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in precisely those cases in which your House has expressed misgivings that the Commission has announced the forthcoming close re-examination of the underlying issues – the social significance of which I acknowledge – and the possibility of our producing new proposals that would actually stand a chance of being considered within an appropriate period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Where justification is concerned, I am of one mind with you; I do not believe that to be a problem in either political or legal terms. When the Commission took its decision, it had in its possession individual justifications for every single proposal. I am myself unable to explain to you why these individual justifications were not put before your House, for I had no objection whatever to that being done, and, moreover, had personally handed over the individual justifications to the groups’ rapporteurs, so I am sure that we will be able to take these proposals into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it quite clear how important it is to me that the rapporteur has not lost sight of the point that the withdrawal of proposals forms part of the exercise of the right of initiative. The Commission is also, in principle, open to your suggestion that the annual legislative and working programme should, in future, indicate which, if any, proposals the Commission intends to withdraw, so that Parliament may express its point of view in good time. I regard that as a very sensible proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that it will be clear to you from my response that I do not believe that we should get into an argument about the principles of this. I am quite happy to acknowledge that things could have been done better in one or other respect, but what matters to me is that we should, together, make a success of the political project, and where that is concerned I can do no other than agree with your rapporteur that that is precisely what Europe’s citizens expect of us. What they expect is not deregulation, not the erosion of rights and certainties, but rather that European legislation should be clear, simple, comprehensible and usable, so let us work together to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am sure that we are agreed that the wording of the Treaty enables the Commission to withdraw proposals up until such time as the Council has taken up a Common Position, and this state of affairs is unsatisfactory from the legal point of view, in that the Commission could, following the first reading in this House, which can require a great deal of effort – one need only think back to the services directive to realise that – withdraw its proposal, thereby wiping out with one stroke of the pen a great deal of work on the part of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to emphasise the principle of sincere cooperation, to which reference has been made in this context. If the first reading stage, with all the hard work that it entails, has been reached, then the Commission should no longer be able to withdraw its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also respond with greater sensitivity if Parliament requests by a large majority that its proposals be withdrawn. I need only remind the House of the dispute about the software patent directive, where we repeatedly asked the Commission to withdraw a proposal that was disastrous and scarcely worthy of mention. It declined to do so, whereupon this House in any case rejected the proposal by over 500 votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think – and you have yourself just said – that there were a number of inconsistencies in the package of withdrawn proposals that was submitted. The Committee on Legal Affairs attached particular importance to the Associations Statute and to there being European law covering such entities. I am pleased to note your willingness to review this matter and look forward to really new proposals, for the ‘justification’ for this package as having to do with the reduction of bureaucracy and of excessive impositions is certainly not applicable here.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want there to be a European law on associations, it is because we want to relax many of the rules and regulations in this area, thereby enabling non-governmental organisations, in particular, to operate more easily across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to something that the Commission has overlooked. We recommended the withdrawal of certain legislative proposals: not just the software patent directive, but also the mediation directive, and I do not see why other proposals for legislation were withdrawn, but this directive was not. Here too, it is not quite clear in what way the package is balanced, but if you can promise us that closer cooperation with Parliament will result in that changing in future, then we will be happy to take note of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent job. The work we did in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs went very smoothly and most of the committee stands behind the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three points. The first point is that our group welcomes the Commission’s initiative of withdrawing 68 pieces of legislation. The original idea of European integration was to bring down walls, not to create them, and the Commission in its analysis and screening did an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, however, is that when we deal with this issue we have to be very careful that we do not start changing the Commission’s exclusive right of initiative. The idea of a new Commission withdrawing initiatives or announcing which initiatives it will withdraw as soon as it comes into office is a good one, and to a certain extent we could say that the Commission did that this time around, which should be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that we want increased consultation between the European Parliament and the Council as well, but it is very important to retain and keep the institutional balance pretty much as it stands. So we want closer involvement, but maintenance of the institutional balance when we talk about screening of legislation in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always considered myself to be a bit of an institutional nerd, but I can guarantee that the next speaker, Mr Corbett, is even more of one! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group, too, welcomes the report by Mrs Kaufmann. We believe it is an excellent report, which has got the balance just about right.</p>
<p class="contents">The original logic of the Treaties, in giving the right of initiative to the Commission – in those days the Commission proposed and the Council disposed – was entirely right for that time. We wanted the Council to work not on the basis of competing drafts put forward by different Member States, but on a common proposal drawn up by an institution that belongs to all of us – the Commission – and that is duty bound to serve the interests of all Member States in the proposals that it brings forward. It was then up to the Council alone to look at that proposal, modify it if necessary, accept it or otherwise. There was a certain balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the original Treaties, though, we have seen the emergence of this Parliament, which was first directly elected in 1979 and more recently has acquired co-legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of their national experience, people in most of our Member States expect that a parliament will have the right of initiative, that its members can propose legislation and that when they stand for election they say they will propose this or that. That is lacking in the European Parliament. It is true that it is lacking in some national parliaments as well and many parliaments have that right in theory, but it is not exercised in practice. Nonetheless it is something our citizens expect.</p>
<p class="contents">So how have we tried to resolve that at European level? The Maastricht Treaty gave this Parliament the right – and the Council already had the same right – to ask the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal. In practice that has usually worked quite well. Now the Commission has told us that it will also listen very carefully to Parliament and consult us before it withdraws proposals. I welcome that sort of not quite sharing but working closely together on the right of initiative, as regards both proposing and withdrawing. I believe the Commission listened to us quite carefully on this recent package, although not, I regret to say, on the proposals regarding mutuals and the European Statute for Associations. There I believe the Commission should review its position. But on the whole I believe the system has worked quite well.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission is going to be able to defend its monopoly on the right of initiative, it must continue to exercise it in that responsible way, to maintain a dialogue with Parliament and take up the legitimate concerns expressed in this Parliament. The Commission must also accept that its right to withdraw should not be a right of veto at the last stage of the legislative procedure. The right to withdraw should exist right up to the end of the first reading in each body, Parliament and then the Council. Once the Council has reached a common position and it comes back to Parliament, it is no longer the property of the Commission. It is a Council common position that we will be dealing with, and so on through the rest of the legislative procedure. The Commission will still play a role, but should not at that stage have the right of withdrawal, which would unbalance the system. It should have it in the first stages, as it does.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome what has been put forward by our committee. It is a good balance in that it proposes that there be due justification, due dialogue, proper consultation and advance notice. If we can work together on that basis, I believe that is a reasonably correct balance in the context of the current Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the need for screening legislative proposals not only in respect of Better Regulation principles or the Lisbon agenda, but also with regard to subsidiarity. I am aware that this is a concept to which this House is increasingly averse, but in no way does that alter the fact that European legislation must clearly add value over and above national legislation. I take the view that fighting overregulation at European level plays an important role in the pursuit of a better and simpler approach to legislation at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the role of national parliaments. I am right behind Mr Barroso’s initiative to send new legislative proposals to the national parliaments, for Member States are capable of carefully screening for subsidiarity, something which will undoubtedly increase the support base for European legislation among Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jo Leinen (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, better lawmaking is one of the Commission’s priorities, and this initiative has been welcomed by both the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House as a whole. There is indeed a great deal of clearing out to do where our legislation is concerned, some of which will involve simplifying and codifying packages of laws, but it will also be necessary to withdraw those that are no longer appropriate, and it is at this point that I would like, not only to thank Mrs Kaufmann for presenting a very good report, but also to make three observations.</p>
<p class="contents">On Wednesday, in the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>, Chancellor Merkel raised the question as to whether we too ought to bring in the concept of discontinuity between one legislative period and another, so that laws would lapse and have to be reintroduced. This was a problem that we had with the Bolkestein directive, when the old Commission had proposed something that its successor certainly did not want in that form, not least because of changes in circumstances and in outlook, so I do think it would be a good thing if the Commission – at the beginning of its term of office, at any rate – were to sift through the proposals on the table in order to determine which they are going to keep because they fit in with their programme, and which they are going to withdraw on the grounds that their substance or something else makes them obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is this: Mr Corbett said, and rightly, that Parliament acquired the right of codecision over a period of time and that there is therefore something missing from Article 250(2), in that it states only that the Commission can no longer withdraw legislation once the Council has delivered its Common Position, but it does not state that it could not do so either following the first reading in this House. There is a loophole in the Treaties, and the only acceptable way to fill it is for us to be very sincere in our dealings with one another, and – as has been said today several times over – for this House to be given a say when the Commission contemplates withdrawing proposals, at least when we have gone past first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you, Mr Vice-President, that we even said that you could withdraw a proposal even following the Council’s Common Position if the Council turned the proposal into something it had not been, for it seems that, on two or three occasions, the Council adopted a resolution that was the precise opposite of what the Commission had intended to propose, and we were advised by the legal service that you would, in such a case, still have the right of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing I want to say is that you mentioned the growth and employment strategy as the yardstick against which these sixty-eight proposals had been measured, and I am glad that you said that this was an inevitability in the case of European law on associations; I live in the Saar-Lor-Lux region, which borders Lorraine and Luxembourg, and I could tell you some stories about the difficulties civil society organisations there have with establishing associations that cross borders. The journalists’ Inter-Regional Press Institute, for example, tried to, and then ended up somehow doing it under French law, because its chairman lived in France, while other associations have had recourse to Luxembourg or German law; that is not an appropriate way of going about things. This is an area in which you should be doing more, perhaps by coming up with a more modern proposal. Overall, though, we are working well together in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The programme is also intended as a response to accusations that Brussels all too frequently opts for legislative mechanisms and, as a result, creates too many laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the Union’s <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>has consisted of tonnes of documents written in a language that is unintelligible to citizens, generally drawn up without consulting European social partners or European citizens. This last accusation suggests that European Union legislation is created without the participation of the citizens of Europe, for whom we, as the European Parliament, work and whom we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">What should be done to change this image and to bring the European Union closer to its citizens, now that it finds itself in the midst of a constitutional crisis? It seems that withdrawing these 68 pieces of draft legislation is a step in the right direction, but is it enough of a step in terms of better legislation? It does not seem enough. It seems that, in order to improve legislation, we need better inter-institutional cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. We need these two institutions to have, as part of their structure, special groups created to work towards better legislation. These groups will act as the conscience of the EU, a legislative barometer which will issue a warning if one of the institutions lapses into bureaucratic routine and acts against the code of good EU legislation and legislative principles such as appropriateness, subsidiarity, cohesion, transparency, proportionality and predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have no doubt that good EU legislation will be possible when good cooperation is established between the Commission and Parliament. Parliament and the Commission must trust each other, respect each other and treat each other as full partners with complete respect and trust. Only then will the legislation improve. Only then will we be able to create legislation together for the good of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
