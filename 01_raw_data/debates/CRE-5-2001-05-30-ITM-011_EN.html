<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dell'Alba (TDI) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, it is an honour to have ten minutes in which to address such a full House on a report which is, after all, quite important and even quite passionate about the subjects which it raises and which relate to it. It deals with the financial regulation of the European Union, the reworking of the financial agreement and obviously accompanies the reform proper of our Union and of our Commission, following the resignation of the Commission, following the report by the Wise Men, following the recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men made and which the European Parliament and our relevant parliamentary committees, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control, accepted in good faith. </p>
<p class="contents">As you will all recall, the Committee on Budgetary Control made a point of highlighting the importance of the work of the Committee of Wise Men. One of the most important reforms recommended by the Wise Men and endorsed by the European Parliament and the famous van Hulten report relates first and foremost to a key reform recommended by the financial regulation, that is, that we abolish financial control in its present form, with all its practical difficulties, and introduce an ex post audit, change the formula without changing the system – on the contrary – in order to extend and make controls more efficient, to quote the Wise Men. </p>
<p class="contents">So it is in the wake of this recommendation that our committees, both the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets subscribed to the thinking of the European Commission and this is one of the points which I want to stress because I shall concentrate in the second part of my speech on the proposed amendments which appear to me to have no bearing whatsoever on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In the five minutes available to me, as rapporteur, in which to present my report, I wish to address the reform by saying that we have taken a very close look at your proposal, Commissioner, and have proposed 260 amendments, proof positive that we have done a proper job. The two Hughes procedure committees with Mr van Hulten, which I thank for working together so closely in order to make progress and keep to the timetable which we thought the Council was going to impose on us because it wanted to address this issue at the ECOFIN Council on 5 June. We asked in vain for the Council to be present – it is too late, the Council is not present, no matter – but we asked it and we pass on the message that we were asked to work quickly and we have worked quickly. We wrapped it up in a few months and I can assure you that it was no easy job.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, we followed your lead. We proposed a great many amendments. I think that in certain areas we have, without doubt, tried to be diligent, to foster transparency, to foster greater budgetary prudence, a more efficient system, clearer, more transparent, faster application of standards for the beneficiaries of our aid, for those who implement some of our budgets, wherever there were shortcomings, and there are shortcomings, it must be said. In certain specific areas we noted a fair backlog in the implementation of projects committed but not spent.</p>
<p class="contents">We tackled the problem of supporting staff and tried to improve the definition of the concept of supporting staff and I trust that you will find that we have done so efficiently, Commissioner. We retained the specific rule in the financial regulation <span class="italic">in toto </span>with a quarrel which we settled thus. We think it is better to keep it in the financial regulation as a legislative instrument. We introduced the notion of financial statements, that is, source law, which we tried to turn into real legislation. We stressed the independence of OLAF. We tried to improve a text which, all said and done, <span class="italic">grosso modo</span>, we felt had the right idea.</p>
<p class="contents">So that finishes my five minutes as rapporteur. Now, in my own name and on behalf of my political group of Italian radicals, I should like to address the amendments proposed because, as you know, Mr President, something strange is afoot in this debate, in which 230 amendments have been tabled by the Committee on Budgets and by the Committee on Budgetary Control and in which we have a committee chair who has also tabled amendments, on behalf of her group of course. It is the law, it is the regulation which so requires, with her name against that of her own committee, of which I am a member. I am sure you will understand that this is rather strange. Imagine, Mrs Schreyer, you make a proposal, the Commission approves it and the following day Mr Prodi attacks you or amends the proposal which has just been voted by your colleague as such. It is, after all, rather strange. A committee which has already examined a great many of these amendments and rejected them. Then re-tables them on behalf of its chair. Its Kramer versus Kramer. I remember a very well-known French minister saying, "a minister shuts up or gets out". </p>
<p class="contents">So I think, Mr President, I do not know what you would do in my position if Mrs Fontaine amended a text on Nice, Mr Méndez de Vigo, a text already voted by Parliament. What would you do? Personally, as rapporteur I would vote against but, as a Member, I feel that there is food for thought here. Is it that either you are the guarantors of a body or you cannot go against the body which you represent? It seems a bit bizarre to me. Many of the amendments were, as I have said, rejected by the committee. So, inevitably, as rapporteur, I was obliged to say that I was against. It is embarrassing because it puts you in an awkward position. There was a consensus in committee to withdraw other amendments and here they are back on the table. It is embarrassing when you know that a committee has already given the thumbs down. Others have come in from the Court of Auditors. The Court of Auditors, however, is not a legislative body; we are all very fond of the Court of Auditors, but we are not here to act as messenger boys, we are here to legislate.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is want I wanted to highlight – and I have taken several minutes to do so – because there is something unhealthy here, although some of the amendments are, shall we say, more than honourable and a group of 233 members could have represented the amendments on someone else's behalf. When I see my chair presenting amendments against my report, in her own name, and against her committee, then I think that there are lessons to be learned. If you do not agree with your committee, you have to draw your own conclusions and perhaps – why not – think about resigning from a position if that position does not suit a man or women in politics who wants to more power, which is all well and good but then they should resign their position (you cannot umpire and play in the match).</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am against the series of amendments seeking to reintroduce the concept of financial controller. We are not here to give the Commission discharge. We shall take great care to ensure that the system introduced and thought up by the Committee of Wise Men, recommended by the Wise Men, this committee which we honoured, is a viable system which works and can be controlled and, if it does not work, we shall be the first to condemn it. The system is up and running, however, and Parliament has endorsed it several times. So I urgently recommend that we follow the line taken in my report and by Mr van Hulten and reject this attempt to backtrack, which has no place in our debate, although we shall still have a great deal to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I will stop there, Mr President, because we are not happy at the moment with the Council's attitude and, if it is alright with you, we shall advise what Parliament's attitude will be tomorrow after the vote. I wonder – but we shall wait for the Commission – if we need to postpone the final vote. However, we shall see tomorrow morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Luckily the two positions are the same on this report. I would like to begin by thanking Mr Dell'Alba for the excellent cooperation we have had on the Financial Regulation and all the colleagues that have worked with us in the different groups. Most groups showed a great willingness to compromise. I would like to thank, in particular, the Liberal, Green, and EDD Groups for their active support in drawing up a package of amendments that was acceptable to a majority of the Budgetary Control Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I was surprised, like my colleague Mr Dell'Alba, that most amendments to this report were tabled by the chair of the Budgetary Control Committee. I agree with Mr Dell'Alba that, of course every Member is entitled to put down amendments to a report, also on behalf of their group. In the case of a committee chair, however, you have to wonder whether they are mixing up roles to the detriment of the standing of their committee.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals today are the most sweeping changes to the Community's financial rules in 21 years. For the Budgetary Control Committee, the reform of financial control is the key aspect of this proposal. Under the Commission's proposal, the <span class="italic">ex ante </span>visa issued by a Central Financial Controller will be abolished and instead Directorates-General will be made fully responsible for the lifecycle of expenditure for programmes carried out under their authority. This is one of the key reforms called for by the Committee of Independent Experts in 1999, when it issued its reports. The CIE concluded, at the time, that most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stemmed from decisions to which financial control gave its approval – the committee also stated that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the visa is a myth. It gave two strong arguments for changing the system and I quote, "First, <span class="italic">ex ante</span> checking, whether it be universal or on the basis of sampling is unlikely to be a cost-effective process. The efforts put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient dissuasive effect. The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of <span class="italic">ex ante</span> control runs up against a crucial objection that <span class="italic">de facto</span> if not <span class="italic">de jure</span>, it displaces responsibility for financial irregularity from the person actually managing expenditure onto the person approving it. This displacement of responsibility means, in effect, that no one is ultimately responsible.”</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors also discussed changes to the financial control regime in its Opinion No 4 of 1997. With respect to the abolition of the <span class="italic">ex ante </span>visa it concluded as follows and I quote again, "As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be any more acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could involve financial officials other than the Financial Controller." Has this test been met? Broadly speaking, yes, at least according to Court Opinion No 2 of this year which commented on the Commission's proposal as follows: The provisions governing the financial actors and therefore the structure of the Community internal control system would represent an important step towards meeting the Court's recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The case for reform is overwhelming, that much is clear, but it is also to an extent a leap in the dark and it can only work if a number of conditions are met: first authorising officers must be held fully accountable; failure must be recognised and dealt with, not covered up.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President urged the speaker to speak more slowly to assist the interpreters)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The same interpreters refuse to translate into Dutch when I speak English, but I am happy to oblige.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the disciplinary procedure must be strengthened. There has been too little action in the past. A financial regularities committee would strengthen the procedure as would other amendments we have introduced. Third, the independence of internal auditors must be guaranteed and so must the professional independence of those that carry out internal audit within the Directorates-General. Finally, minimum standards of financial controls must be adhered to. Amendment No 72 sets this out. In order for this provision to be effective, there is a need for a central official under the responsibility of the DG Budget to set minimum standards without undermining the responsibility of spending DGs.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to negotiate with the Council on this proposal. The only possibility of doing so effectively is to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution under our rules of procedures. Discussion on Article 24 showed that the Council does not pay the slightest attention to Parliament's views, even though the President of the Budgets Committee is here today, and that is particularly surprising coming from the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been approached in recent weeks by a number of national governments asking us to proceed with our vote without delay. The sad fact in today's institutional set-up is that if Parliament wants its voice to be heard it must resort to unusual tactics. I support the case for speedy reform, but on an issue as important as this – financial rules which could with us for the next 21 years – we must refuse to let Parliament's legitimate expectations to negotiate be ignored by an arrogant Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also recognise that budgetary discipline is based on certain principles: unity, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, and specification. However the external budget also requires transparency, because our external budget is constantly exposed to corruption. There are many practical problems which we have to look at in the external budget.</p>
<p class="contents">First, development cooperation is better served by multi-annual programmes rather annual programmes but in the EU this is not so. We have an annual programme which does not work consistently in terms of output targets. Second, output targets are not measured in terms of external budgets so that we do not finally know what we have done with our taxpayers' money. We can never come back to Parliament and report on what has happened with our taxpayers' money. Third, the external budget is constantly underspent while those in need suffer poverty, malnutrition, hunger, disease, underdevelopment and loss of education and life-quality opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, rather than return the funds which are predicted at the beginning of the budget to be unspent – which could then be returned back to Member States who could spend that money more effectively – we keep this money for more than three years and then overspend it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be proud of what we do. I want the world to recognise that we make a substantial contribution. I want our development assistance programme to be the best in the world. We have a long way to go before we achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start by thanking everyone who helped to draft this important report. It was a stubborn, time-consuming and difficult report due to its sheer size and the number of specialist topics which it covers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which results from the amendments to be voted on tomorrow will, I think, represent a balanced compromise between numerous views and a considerable improvement on the original proposal. First, it includes the basic priorities put forward by the European Parliament and, secondly, it includes many of the comments and proposals made by the Court of Auditors. At the same time, it endorses the need for the European Commission to be flexible in implementing the budget, especially given its new activity-based presentation. It proposes ways of improving expenditure commitments, useful and necessary addenda, simplifications designed to make the provisions of the new regulation clear and transparent and, finally, it strengthens the responsibility of financial agents without touching their independence or autonomy. I think the proposed addenda are a step in the right direction and will certainly help to enhance the efficiency of the financial provisions, not that other improvements are not needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to expound on this further but, before closing my speech, I too should like to highlight an unfortunate inconsistency. I refer to the fact that, although the European Parliament is one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, when it comes to the financial regulation, it does not, unfortunately, have the same degree of responsibility, which is basically limited to consultation with the Council. I think that it is our duty to insist on a proper dialogue on mutual terms and on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council within the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I too agree that Parliament should only vote on the amendments tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, recasting the Financial Regulation is a necessarily ponderous process. This regulation is not just a budgetary framework but is also a framework for the provision and financial supervision of accounts and for the duties and responsibilities of the main budgetary players. All of these issues were addressed in the same article of the Treaty, which stipulates the same procedures for all of them, but this does not mean that they should necessarily be dealt with in the same regulatory texts. The fact that their approval requires unanimity in the Council makes changing them even more difficult. Perhaps these reasons explain why this process has been dragging on since July 1996, when the Commission presented its first proposal for recasting the Financial Regulation. All the signs indicate that we are still to see a further stage added.</p>
<p class="contents">The concern to give fresh coherence to a text that has become a tangle of loosely defined rules and provisions therefore appears, of course, to be the most important one in the current round of redrafting. It is neither possible nor desirable, in this round of budgetary framing, to forget the relevant sectoral regulation, which concerns agricultural expenditure, the Structural Funds, research and development and external actions. Nor should we forget the important Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline. In this field, because it is neither politically nor legally acceptable to bulldoze existing regulations and agreements by adopting provisions that run counter to the Financial Regulation, we must reduce the specific rules in the sectoral regulations to the absolute minimum. We also need these to be properly linked with those of the Financial Regulation. Furthermore, we need to make the Interinstitutional Agreement compatible and bring it into line with the Financial Regulation and consider the need to include the Financial Regulation in any future revision of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major issue concerns the Community budget system, organised into authorisations and payments, and the timeframes needed to implement them. The current system demonstrates weaknesses and problems with which we are all familiar, but there is no guarantee that the innovations proposed by the Commission – and even less those suggested by other institutions – will do anything to improve the situation. This is an issue on which a more thorough discussion is needed, based on a full and rigorous study of the workings of the current system. We hope that the Commission will devote the necessary attention to this in its future proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments. Recently, the European institutions approved, at the proposal of the Commission, a directive that imposes harsh penalties on both public and private authorities that do not comply with the maximum payment delay of thirty days. How can the European institutions then seek to exempt themselves from the rules that they have approved for all of the Union’s other institutions, be they public or private? In this regard, I wish to point out that the Commission communication on this matter is far from satisfactory. Only a commitment by the Commission to lead by example in applying to itself the rules that it is proposing for others would be acceptable. By the same token, we Socialists consider it to be a point of honour that this Parliament’s political groups fully comply with all of the procedures that we approve in this Chamber for the Community expenditure of other institutions. We shall pay very close attention to the way in which each group approaches this matter in tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must comment on the Council’s failure to reply to our repeated invitations to discuss the amendments to the Financial Regulation. It would be both absurd and unacceptable for the European Parliament, which is ultimately responsible for discharging the budget, to lose any power to act as a result of the rules governing this regulation. In these circumstances, all we can do is postpone delivering Parliament’s final statement on its position.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by congratulating our rapporteurs, Gianfranco Dell'Alba and Michiel van Hulten, who have produced an excellent piece of work, and we wish to see this work continue in the same climate of cooperation in which it has been undertaken until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Drawing it up, analysing the proposed amendments and presenting compromises was an enormous task. In that respect, this report and its preparation are in a class of their own. At the same time I would like to thank Michiel van Hulten for excellent teamwork. Renewing the Financial Regulation is the most important step in modernising the administration of the Commission and the whole of the EU. Its most important objective is to improve the efficiency of administration, clarify personal responsibility and speed up the movement of funds. The EU has a poor reputation as a payer of bills as payments are made many times more slowly than would be acceptable in the world of business and when making payments in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the greatest reason for reform is to clarify personal responsibility and financial accountability. This can only be achieved once both administrative and financial responsibility are clearly united under the same people as is now being done. Renewing the Financial Regulation is essential to improving the efficiency of administration. It opens up the opportunity to develop results-based management and activity-based budgeting. In this way the work of offices and bodies can be managed more on the basis of goals and results rather than on the basis of supervision and detailed instructions. Bureaucracy will be reduced and at the same time the bodies will be given the opportunity to improve their own working methods themselves. This would also increase their own responsibility for their work. However, achieving reform means reforming personnel regulations, which would require good cooperation with employee organisations, among others. However, change is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to present some details that are important to my group. A three-year ceiling must be set for the use of funds granted, after which the funds unused would be cancelled. Transferring funds to the following year is an important tool in flexible budgeting policy. In principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management. The Commission has put forward a proposal for a new Financial Regulation based on the principles of decentralised responsibility and transparency. The two rapporteurs, Mr Dell’Alba and Mr van Hulten, have worked through the proposal in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control and tabled amendments. They deserve praise and recognition for this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my group finds a number of points still open. Firstly, the Commission’s most recent report on combating fraud in the year 2000 showed a massive increase in fraud and irregularities compared to the previous year. Around EUR 2 billion were lost. Experience shows that at best 15% to 20% of the losses can be recovered. In such circumstances, is there any sense in abolishing preventive <span class="italic">ex ante</span> checks by independent financial control? We do not want a return to schematic centralised preliminary controls that took away responsibility and created a false sense of security. Rather, on the basis of efficient risk analyses and random checks, independent financial controllers should in future help to ensure decentrally that taxpayers’ money is not spent illegally from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: with more responsibility at all levels, it will in future be possible to hold financial actors liable for negligence or deliberate breaches of the financial regulations. Our motion here is designed to create a fair procedure by means of an independent body for all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of independence: we are astonished to note that the Commission in its proposal for the new Financial Regulation has quietly deleted the independent right of action for internal auditors that is enshrined in the present Financial Regulation. We should like to restore this again through a motion.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point: the Advisory Committee on Procurements and Contracts. This is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded. At the last session in Strasbourg, this House resolved to reform this procedure. I think we will lose credibility if we now call for the body to be abolished 14 days later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR two billion in tax money disappeared in the year 2000 as a result of fraud and irregularities. That is an extremely worrying phenomenon. Europe has a bad reputation as it is in this area, and we need to pull out all the stops to fight this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, we are discussing the review of the Financial Regulation. Against this backdrop, I should like to make a few observations. It will not come as a surprise to you that I too advocate effective and modern control. The Commission and rapporteurs want to abandon centralised, independent ex ante control. That must be replaced by decentralised ex post control. We debated this very issue at an earlier occasion. I then noted that I welcomed the introduction of an independent ex post audit, but that that should not be at the expense of the opportunity of independent ex ante control. If we are to introduce this across the board, I fear that we will turn this fine dream into a nightmare.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of a system in which independent ex post audits are the rule. The option of independent ex ante control must continue to exist. I can think of many situations in which a systematic or random ex ante control is necessary in the event of proven irregularities. If we remove this option from the Financial Regulation, we will surrender an important weapon in the fight against fraud, and that would be irresponsible at a time when we have not gained any experience of decentralised ex post control. I would therefore call on my fellow MEPs to support our amendments in this connection, so as to avoid the abolition of ex ante control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to remind the illustrious rapporteur, Mr Dell'Alba, that above and beyond differences of opinion, which are always legitimate, there must be parliamentary courtesy and the individual right of Members to carry out their work, which includes the presentation of amendments should they deem it necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we should be pleased, firstly because we are dealing with the first broad legislative proposal on the financial regulation of the Union, which runs in partnership with the administrative reform of management and human resources procedures and which must be the undeniable political objectives of Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It was decided – correctly, in my view – not to correct the defects in the legislative framework employed until now and, instead, to implement a new administrative culture on control and spending efficiency in the quest for the common objective of the better and more transparent management of public money. The rules on decision-making in this field, however, show very little political logic. We should therefore be pleased with the strategy which the rapporteur is suggesting: to vote for amendments which reflect good work and a good departure point for the discussion of the more delicate aspects of the proposal, and to force the Council to take account of the opinion of the European Parliament when the Commission presents its amended proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">During the desirable and possible interinstitutional dialogue, we must try to negotiate a financial regulation which is intended to be permanent, which substantially takes account of this Parliament’s often repeated priorities in this field. In order to achieve this permanence there are some very controversial aspects, such as the removal of <span class="italic">ex ante </span>control, which may distract us from other deficiencies with broader repercussions. I am referring to the regulation of the public markets and to subsidies. The current situation is not only bad, but chaotic. Throughout these recent years, we have not been able to harmonise the multi-coloured situation of public contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the information which Parliament requires for the purposes of the discharge of the budget – and I would ask you to be benevolent, Mr President – I believe that the Commission’s position is coherent insofar as it respects the basic elements of the framework Interinstitutional Agreement on the application of Article 206 of the Treaty. I believe that in this field we can and must agree a text based on a consensus in the future, safeguarding the principles which are essential to this Parliament, such as human rights, fundamental freedoms and non-interference in <span class="italic">sub judice</span> procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is more necessary than ever to stress this aspect because the Commission itself informed us two weeks ago that the sum of money lost as a result of fraud and irregularities in the year 2000 amounts to an impressive EUR 2028 million. That really is nothing for Europe to be proud of! Remedial action is more than necessary. The only question is how the Commission proposes to rectify the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of its reform programme it wants to abolish the independent financial controller, the very institution that experience shows to have been the most successful in combating fraud – I only have to mention the Fléchard case. That is like the police ordering all guard dogs to be put down after the number of burglaries in a residential area has doubled. Parliament has argued for decentralised independent financial control, in fact it has voted for it several times, most recently on 4 April 2001 in the preliminary report for discharge for 1998. The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty. An<span class="italic"> </span>internal auditor is not a financial controller in new clothing but a dummy package that for my group at any rate is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">A necessary counterpart to independent financial control is the clear assignment of responsibility, of liability for deliberate contraventions or neglect of duty by officials such as is, incidentally, found in the national laws of all the Fifteen. It seems to me that the Commission’s reform efforts will in this instance result in financial responsibility being passed to and fro like in a marshalling yard until in the end nobody knows what track it is on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Financial Regulation should make for clarity, transparency and comprehensibility in the implementation of the budget. That is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we have the opportunity to debate Parliament’s amendments and reports. I should like to begin by expressing my thanks and admiration to two gentlemen, the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Dell’Alba, and the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr van Hulten. They have accomplished a very comprehensive piece of work in a really very short space of time, for which my admiration and my thanks. I should of course also like to express my thanks for the intensive and detailed work done by the committees.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the reports of the rapporteurs, we now also have the report of the Court of Auditors, which was published back in March, and we have the draft Council Recommendation. I should like to stress in particular how valuable it is that Parliament supports this tight, this ambitious timetable, namely to have a new Financial Regulation available by 2002 if at all possible, and thanks to your work we are making good progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire procedure is far from easy, as has been said. Unanimity is required in the Council, and the formal procedure provides only for a simple consultation for Parliament. The Commission understands that Parliament would like to see this procedure designed such that Parliament’s amendments are also reflected in the final outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">You know the proposal that the Commission presented for the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice. The Commission does not yet have a formal position on Parliament’s amendments since a formal opinion of Parliament is not yet available, but I should like this evening to make known my positive appraisal of a number of tabled amendments. The results of the consultation with Council, European Parliament and Court of Auditors show a high degree of agreement in many areas. In others there is still a need for clarification and coordination over matters of principle or technical details.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by going over a few basic principles once again. As has been mentioned, the present Financial Regulation dates back to 1977 and we have at present actually more of a patchwork quilt than a coherent plan of financial and budgetary provisions. The proposal therefore contains a fundamental simplification and restructuring. All the principles and essential provisions for financial management are to be combined in a single legal instrument. I am therefore cautious about a number of tabled amendments that propose introducing what are rather special elements again.</p>
<p class="contents">Detailed and technical provisions will have their place in the implementing regulation to be adopted by the Commission. To remind ourselves again, the Commission’s proposal has two parts. First, the provisions designed to tighten up and update the rules and procedures for budget management and discharge, and secondly the provisions that reform financial management and the budget structure and thus also the roles of the financial actors.</p>
<p class="contents">The first section sets out more rational rules for nearly all fields covered by the present Financial Regulation. The principles of annuality and unity will be more strictly adhered to. There will only be separate appropriations, which means that there will only be commitment and payment authorisations for all expenditure, and the Commission is very glad that Parliament supports this position and this revision. It will simplify the procedure for carrying appropriations over to the next financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">Then an important point. There will be no more negative expenditure and revenue. As earmarked revenue, negative expenditure in agriculture will be handled according to the rules for that sector. Here on this point we are unable to go along with Parliament’s amendments, which propose that such negative expenditure in the agricultural sector be considered other general revenue, because that would in fact have very serious consequences in that agricultural expenditure would then have to be cut in proportion to the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Interinstitutional Agreement provides – it includes it especially – that expenditure funded out of earmarked revenue should not be set against the cap of the financial perspective. That is one of the main reasons why we say that this agricultural revenue should be provided as earmarked revenue. If that is not the case, it means that agricultural expenditure would have to be cut by comparison with today, and that should be prevented. The Financial Regulation should not be used to cut agricultural expenditure more or less by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the important aims of the revision is that commitments for external aids should be translated more quickly into concrete projects. In order to achieve a more rigorous execution it is therefore proposed that global commitments should be processed by 31 December of the financial year n+1 except for the implementation of financial conventions in connection with external policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The new version transposes the EU directives on public procurement into the Financial Regulation. To prevent irregularities, fraud and corruption, tenderers or bidders who are shown to have behaved in such ways can be excluded from contracts, a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as financial aids are concerned, fundamental principles – like the existence of a basis in law – are transparently formulated. Under the proposal it will then also be possible to administer all external aids going to third countries decentrally. This is another aspect frequently mentioned by the Committee on Budgets as a way of increasing efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part proposes a solid system for financial management based on performance and results. This system has two key components, firstly greater responsibility for those administering the appropriations, and secondly the incorporation of controls into the financial management procedures. I can only endorse what Mr van Hulten has said. The aim is precisely to make it possible to pinpoint responsibility. Because today we have a situation where the various directorates-general that administer the funds are able to hide behind centralised financial control, and precisely that will be abolished. Responsibility will be assignable for all who have to handle money. Then they will no longer be able to hide in this way. That is a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Theato, you have just said in connection with your tabled amendments – which the Commission naturally does not welcome because they would reverse the whole system again – that the most recent fraud report would show how important <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls are. You have chosen the wrong example there! I have to say it as simply as that because the statistics in that report are the statistics of financial controllers in the Member States. They are statistics of reported cases, in customs for example. There are no <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls in customs. Or in agricultural policy: here <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls take place only by way of commitments. Payments are not checked by centralised <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls here in Brussels but by the payment offices in the Member States. It is exactly the same with structural aids. The question of whether we want to continue having centralised <span class="italic">ex ante </span>controls or not and the statistics from the Member States are completely unrelated because <span class="italic">ex ante </span>controls do not take place there but in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the structure of the budget plan, I should like briefly to comment on a number of remarks that have been made during the debate. For the purpose of activity based budgeting we propose abolishing the separation between A and B. That will of course not reduce transparency, it is actually intended to increase it. It is not the case that staff appropriations or administrative appropriations will no longer be shown separately in future. They will of course continue to have their own budget lines which will be decided by Parliament together with the Council. Only it will no longer be a global part that appears consolidated in the budget, but it will be assigned to the various policy areas. That increases transparency over all.</p>
<p class="contents">The following points are consistent with the Commission’s position. I am referring now to the amendments tabled by the rapporteurs concerning the role of the actors, the precedence of the Financial Regulation over sectoral rules or provisions, the definition of commitments and externalisation. I should particularly like to welcome Amendment No 44 on the definition of a financial statement and its function. I believe this is a very important clarification, like a number of clarifications contained in the amendments, which are very much welcomed by the Commission because, I believe, they very much enhance the usability and legal clarity that the Financial Regulation is intended to create.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned that we cannot go along with the amendments on negative revenue and expenditure. I should like to say the following on this point: regarding customs revenue you suggest in the amendments that the portion of administrative appropriations that can be retained in the Member States be shown as expenditure in the budget. That would then be Category 5 expenditure and would create entirely new problems in that category even though it is indeed money that does not pass through the Commission budget at all. I think, however, we will be able to agree on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there is any point in saying something about all the different amendments now because that would take us long past midnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by noting that the European Parliament would like to postpone the formal vote on the resolution for the time being. I should like to repeat again that I understand and support the European Parliament wanting to add weight to its position in the negotiations. I therefore intend, at next week’s ECOFIN Council on 5 June, to invite the Presidency to a quadrilogue together with the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the Commission so that we can agree in a quadrilogue – a new coinage – on how to proceed, but above all so that we can discuss the content. The meeting should then be held as soon as possible. I hope that this will enable the European Parliament to adopt its formal opinion at an early date. The Commission would like to present its revised proposal in September in the light of further developments and hopefully of further agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully, Parliament will be able to make a decision tomorrow, so that the Commission can proceed with revising the proposal. In this case, we would be able to present it in September and hopefully achieve a decision on the Final Regulation as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, of course, also noted what Mrs Schreyer said about her bringing the issue up at the ECOFIN meeting and I look forward to this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
