We discussed this topic at first reading on 12 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for a directive was prompted by the high number of accidents involving bulk carriers. Research has shown that many of these accidents were caused by the condition of the ship’s side. Damage to the side can, in combination with wave movements, have fatal consequences. An inventory of procedures and practice showed that bulk carriers regularly incurred damage during the loading or unloading thereof. It also transpired that hardly any procedures are being applied to help prevent this damage to bulk carriers from occurring. At international level, a code has been drafted which stipulates the fundamental safety principles for loading and unloading: the Bulk Loading and Unloading Code, or BLU Code. Based on these principles, procedures have been prescribed which are to be observed prior to, during, and following, the loading and unloading of bulk carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the key points are: firstly, the appointment of a terminal representative and, secondly, the possibility of the port authorities discontinuing the loading and unloading activities in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite calls by the IMO to transpose the BLU Code into national legislation, this has, so far, not been done in many countries. The European Commission would like to change this. On behalf of the fifteen Member States, it wants to meet the IMO’s request and afford the BLU Code legal status.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal, therefore, aims to include the BLU Code in Community legislation. In addition, it contains the requirement to set up a quality care system at terminals so that the quality of the loading and unloading activities is permanently guaranteed to be at a sufficient level. This system is also intended as the opposite number on land of the ISM safety system, which applies to bulk carriers at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading of this proposal on 13 February 2001, Parliament approved of the basic idea of this proposal and backed fourteen amendments thereto. The most important amendments related to two topics:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the obligation of the competent authorities to intervene in the loading and unloading process as soon as they are informed of a dangerous situation arising for the personnel or the ship.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the improvement of data flows between the players involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In its common position, the Council has adopted the bulk, namely eleven, of these amendments, at least, in spirit. That leaves three that were not adopted. Furthermore, the Council has added a number of elements. I should like to briefly comment on those elements and the three amendments that were not adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, the scope is somewhat scaled down. The directive now applies to ships which call at a port in the European Union and are not unloaded by means of their own equipment. Moreover, terminal operators are entitled to confine themselves in terms of inspection and information to those fields for which they are directly responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council has made a few changes to the compulsory quality care system. For new terminals, a start-up delay has been added, while existing terminals are given three years to meet the requirements. Another new aspect is the fact that in addition to ISO 9001:2000, other equivalent systems are also allowed. Consequently, terminals which already operate a suitable quality system need not incur high costs to install another, equivalent system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council has supplemented the amendments, which improve reporting between the different players.</p>
<p class="contents">The three points which the Council was eventually unable to accept concern minor changes to recital 13, to Article 10, Paragraphs 1 and 2. In addition, a few changes have been made in the annexes which remove a number of superfluous provisions and build in a few safety guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Having assessed all changes made by the Council, my conclusion is that the Council has accommodated all Parliament’s essential amendments. The remaining amendments are not of any major significance and would not justify a further delay in the introduction and application of this legislation. That is why the recommendation which I, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, are making in this Parliament is to adopt the common position unchanged and to insist on a prompt implementation and application in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that this recommendation is a major step forwards, particularly in the field of maritime safety, especially since the statistics of past years are extremely alarming: in the last 10 years, between 1990 and 1999, we recorded the sinking of 146 bulk carriers and the deaths of 780 crew members, all of which occurred during the loading or unloading of these carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s directive harmonises, at last, a field of legislation which has allowed too many, too dangerous exceptions in the past. We are going to harmonise the loading and unloading procedures, the safety standards inside and outside terminals and the levels of responsibility on board vessels and ashore.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that all this has served to improve quality, first and foremost; we feel that quality must be an essential, basic condition if safety standards are to be satisfactory. I welcome the fact that a balance was found quickly between Parliament and the Council’s positions, a balance which, moreover, respects the spirit of the amendments proposed and adopted by Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">At last, as of today, we are on the way to more stringent legislation, to a code of procedure which has the merit of courageously placing safety above all other concerns, including economic and financial concerns. That is why we are totally satisfied with the final version of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasing marine safety requires ongoing work. Increasing the safety of loading and unloading of bulk carriers is an important aspect of work for the improvement of safety in the shipping sector. As is the case in many matters concerning marine safety, these rules are also agreed at the International Maritime Organisation on a voluntary basis. Since the regulations are currently being applied only intermittently, it is good that they are being incorporated into Community legislation. Improving the loading and unloading of bulk carriers and the efficient performance of ports will also further the development of important intermodal transportations. Along with a further tightening of the rules, care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest shortcoming in the position of the Council is that, as the rapporteur states, information need not be given on all damage caused to the structure and fittings of a vessel. In addition, I wish to call attention to the fact that decisions to increase marine safety, which are made only within the Union, are not sufficient. Questions of safety and liability must, as far as possible, be dealt with on a worldwide basis. The matter needs to be given a rapid passage, even though the common position of the Council has not included all the proposals of the Parliament's first reading. Our group supports approval of the common position as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish, in particular, to thank Mr van Dam for his report and for the help he has given the Commission in its efforts to increase the safety of bulk carriers. This directive will transpose into Community legislation the code of the International Maritime Organisation, which is currently in force in relation to the safe loading and unloading of ships, as well as certain parts of the convention for the safety of life at sea. This code, which is, in fact, a recommendation, was established by the IMO in 1997, but, so far, it has not been widely applied. As soon as its application becomes obligatory in all the Union’s ports, this code will be much more widely used and will, therefore, contribute to the safety of all bulk carriers visiting the Union. As the rapporteur has indicated, this directive is aimed at combating the phenomenon of the disappearance of bulk carriers, that is, the sinking of these ships, which suddenly break up in open sea and sink in a few minutes, thereby causing the loss of considerable human life. As Mr Fava has said, these statistics are unfortunately quite clear: over the last ten years, these wrecks have caused the loss of 134 ships with 743 victims, and there is a consistent tendency in terms of the average age and the total annual dead weight of the ships which have disappeared. It was, therefore, necessary to deal with this issue of the safety of bulk carriers, and it is known that bad loading and unloading methods are considered to be one of the main causes of these tragic accidents. As the rapporteur has said, the directive is designed to ensure that the handling of cargo in our ports respects strict rules, so as to prevent damage to ships during loading or unloading of heavy bulk cargo. Before and during loading and unloading, the crew on board and the dock personnel must be in contact and in agreement, and, furthermore, a plan must be agreed in advance in relation to the way the loading and unloading will be carried out. Heavy equipment which is often used in these operations must be handled with caution, and, in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, the dock personnel and the crew on board, the competent authority must be able to intervene to suspend the operations in order to prevent possible damage to the structure of the bulk carriers. The Commission is therefore very pleased that Parliament intends to accept the common position of the Council without amendments, because, if it is adopted rapidly, this directive will be able to enter into force very soon. This also shows that, on sensitive maritime issues, the European Parliament and the Council are able to rapidly reach a decision with the greatest degree of cohesion, and the Commission hopes that the cohesion demonstrated in this case will also be demonstrated in relation to the other great issues which are currently on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
