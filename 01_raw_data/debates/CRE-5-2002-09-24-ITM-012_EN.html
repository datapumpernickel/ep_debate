<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Herman (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to begin by stating that unemployment is increasing in Europe, increasing in Germany, increasing in France and increasing in other Member States. The economy has stagnated, and the European Employment Strategy faces major challenges. It must become much more effective. A look at the research behind the Commission’s report leaves one in no doubt as to what are the biggest practical problems for the European employment process. They are that it is not being implemented effectively enough in the Member States, that it has only marginally influenced the national employment strategies and that it is, in general, unknown to the actors in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">This pattern must be broken. The European employment strategy must be combined with the national employment strategies in the Member States and must also be rolled out at regional and local levels. The question that arises, however, is that of how this is to take place. My answer is clear and unambiguous. The national and regional parliaments must be allowed to debate and decide on the national action plans. It may perhaps appear self-evident that national action plans should be decided upon and discussed in the national parliaments, but that does not in actual fact happen in any Member State today. It is all the more important that it should do so inasmuch as it is the parliaments that, in approving national employment policies, also appropriate the financial resources needed if the policies are to be put into practice. A national action plan that comes from Europe and has no connection with the parliaments will naturally be ineffective, as will the attendant budgetary process. That is an incredibly important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the Commission’s reports concentrate very much upon how European cooperation is to be developed, coordinated and synchronised. I think that is very good, but I want to make two observations. First of all, administrative coordination must also result in coordination in the working environment. It is not enough for officials to cooperate better across borders. Instead, something must also happen out in the labour markets. New jobs and more employment must be created. Otherwise, the result is all talk and no action.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission’s synchronisation report is concerned, to my surprise, with only two processes, namely the economy and employment. I wonder what happened to the social process. Coordination must of course be based upon all three processes. They are all equally important, and each has its contribution to make. If the social process were to be squeezed out, integrated overall solutions would soon be replaced by the perspective of the employer alone. The result would then be conflict and strife instead of constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission to stick by the Lisbon decisions, which emphasise both economic growth and social integration, which give just as much weight to the quality of working life as to the quantity of work produced and which make full employment, viewed in the light of sustainability, a prime objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to underline the value of the open method of coordination, which invites the Member States to take part in a learning and development process that can be <span class="italic">far</span> more effective than the traditional way in which legislation is steered through. The method is still in its infancy. It needs to be developed and implemented more consistently, especially within the individual Member States where it can be combined with entrepreneurship and development strategies that create both jobs and a qualified work force.</p>
<p class="contents">I should finally also like to address the absent Council of Ministers, which will meet on 8 October and say that it is not enough to take certain steps to simplify a bureaucratic European cooperation process. There is also a need to set political priorities and to take practical initiatives that will lead to action and that are based on the decisions taken in Lisbon. We also need important changes in the Member States if we are ever to obtain a coordinated and effective European employment process. We therefore require a bottom-up process to complement the present top-down process at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication being debated today is based on the evaluation by the Commission and the Member States of five years of the employment strategy in practice. The results are important and I should like to reiterate a number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten million jobs have been created in Europe, as the result both of economic growth in previous years and efficient reforms on numerous job markets. We have seen important structural changes in most Member States, qualitative changes in employment policies and numerous countries have made progress in energising the job market, preventing long-term unemployment, introducing the most employment-friendly tax systems yet, gradually adapting education and training systems and introducing more flexible labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important about the employment strategy is that the driving force behind it was the management of basic objectives. The Member States had common objectives and used the open method of coordination. Much still remains to be done and this is set out every year in the Commission's common report and guidelines. Your motion contains some very interesting ideas on how we need to proceed and we need to draw on what we have learned to date so that we can make a number of changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse the three priorities which you have set: first, the need to increase the rate of employment in relation to the Lisbon objectives, secondly, the question of the quality of work and, thirdly, the need to reduce inequalities on the job market, and here I would highlight the question of inequalities at numerous levels, the gaps on the job market, be they skills gaps, inequalities at regional level or inequalities between the two sexes. As far as inequalities between the Member States and the new countries after enlargement are concerned, I disagree with the proposal in the explanatory statement that we should operate with two parallel strategies. We need a single strategy and common objectives, although naturally we shall use national recommendations to differentiate our message and accommodate the peculiarities of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Commission also appear to agree on the need to rationalise the procedure. One important priority is to ensure the strategy continues to be efficient and discriminating. The philosophy we propose is fewer guidelines and a stronger medium-term strategy, more stable guidelines; to put it simply, fewer guidelines which are valid for a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, one question which arises when we talk of updating is the scope of future guidelines. What will their scope be? Will they relate specifically to the job market or more globally to all the basic factors which influence employment policies? We take the view that they should have a broad scope which covers the main factors which influence the level and quality of employment in our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the management model, the method used to manage and administer the employment strategy is concerned, I totally agree that we need to incorporate the employment strategy at all levels of national planning. We have seen interesting examples of regional and local employment strategies over the past 5 years, local action plans on employment have been submitted, and this was a successful initiative. The commitment and contribution of the two sides of industry is very important. Of course, our initial evaluation is that not every means of involving them has been exhausted and that important efforts are needed. And as far as the involvement of civil society is concerned, it is still early days as regards any decisive involvement of civil society in employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the national parliaments have a vital role to play. The parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already organised events with national parliaments on exchanging experience and information and we believe that this should continue but that, in future proposals, starting with the debate in the Convention, the national parliaments should play a more important part in national action plans and the European Parliament should play a more important part in the European procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment has to do with bringing the European Employment Strategy into line with the general economic policy guidelines, as proposed in our communication of 3 September. We hope that, in adopting this proposal, which I presented to Parliament the day it was adopted, we will achieve greater cohesion between the two strategies, without calling the independence of the employment strategy in question. The purpose of the communication taking stock of the strategy, together with the communication on rationalisation, is to start an open debate on the future of the European employment strategy. After five years in practice, I think that your report has made a valuable contribution and that the Council will do likewise at its meeting on 8 October, when one of the basic issues of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be the debate on the evaluation and the future of the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the official proposal on the 2003 guidelines on employment will be submitted next April, together with the proposal on the general economic policy guidelines. In the interim, there is time enough for everyone to take part in this procedure and express their opinion. In order to broaden and facilitate this debate, the Commission intends to publish a further communication in January which, as far as the timing of specific proposals is concerned, will come halfway between the communications already approved and the proposal for the 2003 guidelines. This means we shall have two-and-a-half months in which to conduct an in-depth debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We eagerly await your proposals and, if we draw on experience from the past five years, we shall be able to improve the employment strategy dramatically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All in all, its four pillars have passed the test.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, employability, includes developing skills and qualifications. The second concerns the adaptability of the individual to the ever-increasing demands in companies and society. The third is entrepreneurship with the aim of job creation, and the fourth, equal opportunities, is one of the most important pillars, which, like the others, needs to be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">The very ambitious aim is to make the European Union into the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, but this is not only significant in terms of the economy; there are also clear implications for social policy. In 1997 there were 17 million people unemployed in the European Union. Last year there were 13 million. This year, however, the figures are clearly rising again. This is particularly noticeable in my own country, Germany. We must not become accustomed to these high figures.</p>
<p class="contents">In some countries, however, there has been an increase in employment and women in particular have benefited from this. Nevertheless – and here is the rub – the jobs concerned are mainly part-time and lower qualified jobs. The Member States must, by creating the appropriate conditions, by policy-making and by negotiating constructively with the social partners, create higher quality jobs, in particular in the full-time sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still miles away from achieving the ambitious goal set in the Lisbon Council Conclusions of an employment rate of 70% or 60% for women between 2000 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we criticise the fact that the Member States still have not set any employment rates for women in their national action plans. In the NAPs no significant suggestions are made for improving performance in the equality initiative. On average women earn 76% of the hourly rate for men. The social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value.</p>
<p class="contents">To create jobs, women also need to be encouraged to found firms or become self-employed through targeted support. What does this involve? Reducing the burden on business, simplifying the formalities, particularly at the start-up phase, and setting up funds. It also involves securing access for women to education and vocational training. Gender-specific discrimination must therefore be combated energetically. We call for these steps to be included in the national action plans in the future so that their results can be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Equal Opportunities and Women's Rights we addressed one further interesting issue: how better to reconcile work and family life. Progress has definitely been made in the Member States. However, in many cases working conditions are not sufficiently family friendly. There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other dependents and in general there is a lack of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The main points in my opinion were accepted unanimously by the lead committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Herman Schmid for his concise report and for his ability not only to seek compromises but also to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My work in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was not the only say that I had in the Schmid report, because I was also the shadow rapporteur for my group, the PPE, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite a willingness to establish common ground, there were quite a few differences of opinion. That is why we will be tabling amendments again tomorrow in the plenary. Let me give you an example. Since the Luxembourg employment summit, which was initiated by the highly successful Council Presidency of Jean-Claude Juncker, we have all endeavoured to achieve better coordination of economic and employment policy. Agreed! However, we must not ignore the fact that it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the practical measures. That is where investment is made, but unfortunately all too often withheld. That is where the competence for taxation, social security and other charges lies. There social policy is at home with different national traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree that the open coordination method needs to be extended to all areas of social policy. Although it is necessary to strengthen democracy and involve as many stakeholders as possible, we must not have it extended haphazardly to any number of players in civil society, because there is a risk, Commissioner, that Members of Parliament, at both national and European level, and the social partners will be sidelined in the process. That would be wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we are successful in winning the support of other groups for this and other important amendments. If so we will have a majority not only in the committees but also in the plenary tomorrow in favour of Herman Schmid's otherwise expert report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that many Member States still have much to do to reduce high levels of unemployment. It is very easy to set targets and to make promises – as Chancellor Schröder has found out – but the jobless need action and not words.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that job creation is a major challenge. I disagree with his conclusions that we need the Commission to examine anew the causes of low economic growth and to submit suggestions to reverse it. The causes are clear, the actions required are clear. What is needed is the political will to make it happen.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, no solution to unemployment in strengthening the role of the social partners to quote the rapporteur 'in all matters' regarding the organisation of work and working conditions – though I am sure the trade unions are always looking for such an opportunity. The social partners may well have a very useful role in some countries and in some cases but, given that the majority of employment growth is coming from SMEs whose employees are beholden neither to big business nor to big unions, it is hard to see how such a move would be positive for job creation. Certainly we must all put job creation at the top of our own agendas. I earnestly hope that colleagues from all sides of the House, and indeed the Commissioner, will reflect on this when we are voting on the Atypical Workers Directive in a few weeks time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andersson (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mr Herman Schmid for his extremely valuable cooperation in preparing this report. He has been very constructive. I share the Commissioner’s view that the employment strategy has been successful, as far as we can see. During the five years that it has been applied, unemployment has gone down, the number of jobs has increased and, for example, the active labour market policy, which was previously being conducted at a very low level in Europe, has now been considerably improved, partly through lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Big improvements have taken place. Nevertheless, there remains a lot to be done, just as the Commission’s document states. Unemployment is still too high. There is a big gap when it comes to education and lifelong learning. Those who already have a high level of education also help themselves to most of the education offered in the labour market, and those who have least education do not obtain as much. There are also big regional differences within Europe. The overhaul and improvement of the employment strategy are necessary therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself think that the pillar structure has been valuable as a structural instrument, because some parts of the pillar structure have been more successful than others. The employability pillar has been relatively successful, and the equality pillar has also been successful in the sense that female employment has increased, even though a lot remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the adaptability pillar, which is a little more difficult to understand, has not been as successful. This is nonetheless an important area we must continue to work on, for it is this which has an influence upon working life, the working environment and lifelong learning out there in the workplace. All these factors must be improved in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission is now proposing to coordinate employment policy and economic policy, but I share Mr Herman Schmid’s view that social security too, in relation to which we also have a European process, must be involved in this coordination. When coordination takes place, no area must be given precedence over another. It is easy, both at national and European levels, to allow economic policy and the economic process to take precedence over the socio-political dimension and considerations relating to employment policy. That must not happen. They are equally valuable processes which must be treated equally when coordination takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard open coordination as a complement to legislation, not as an alternative to it. We must, however, improve the actual way in which the open method of coordination is applied. Since there is no qualified majority in the Council on the issue of the objectives, it is reasonable for the European Parliament to have the right of co-decision concerning these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the national action plans, I share Mr Herman Schmid’s outlook. It goes without saying that they must be debated and decided upon in the national parliaments. It is only fair that we should have democratic control, both at European and national levels, where these important issues are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to involve other actors. Of these, the two sides of industry are perhaps the most important of all. It is important for them to be involved in devising policy, both at European level and at the other levels. It is also important, as mentioned in our proposal, for the candidate countries to be integrated into this process at an early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of differences between the candidate countries and our own countries, but there are also similarities. Demographic developments and the demands they make upon the labour market are similar in the candidate countries. Consequently, the candidate countries need to be involved in this process soon. Moreover, we want to see a clearer link between employment policy and existing economic instruments, namely the European Social Fund and Equal. The employment strategy underlying those instruments must be made clear; clearer, that is to say, than it is at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, we are encouraged by the developments in this process but, as mentioned earlier, institutional changes are needed: better coordination and a strengthening of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments. We must not forget, however, that economic policy, employment policy and the respective councils must be accorded equal value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to his knowledge, expertise and focus, we have obtained a very stringent report. I also very much agree with his observations to the effect that the European employment policy must be organised to a greater degree from the bottom up rather than from the top down. That is a matter on which I agree with him, in spite of the fact that our political starting points are otherwise very different.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all of us raised the issue of whether the European employment policy has worked, and we have of course genuinely obtained a situation in which countries are speaking more of a common language in some areas. Unemployment is nonetheless still high in many countries, and it has almost become a persistent feature of countries that set the trend. There is a lack of structural reform and not enough ability to comply with the employment strategy. What ought therefore to happen? The answer is that we must strengthen the employment strategy by making it more open, because it is important for governments to commit themselves to the strategy on behalf of their electorates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we simplify the employment strategy and make its objectives clearer, and the Commission and the Council are both thinking along those lines. It is the correct path to go down. Rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated, we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we involve the local and regional authorities and both sides of industry. That is something for which Parliament has fought, and it has now become an integral part of the European employment strategy. As pointed out in this opinion, it is both desirable and important for us to involve the national and regional parliaments so as to broaden the public debate and enable national politicians to assess the employment strategy, see what is being done in other countries and learn from their experiences. On the other hand, I think that open coordination should continue to be intergovernmental, and it must be flexible. Employment policy is a national competence, and that is a fact that must not be changed by the back door. It is therefore important that no change be made by the back door to the character of employment policy by, for example, giving Parliament the right of co-decision. That is not something we can support. It is also essential to ensure coordination with economic policy. Success in employment policy will of course be synonymous with success in economic policy. Many countries struggle with large budget deficits which they would not have at all if they were to abolish large-scale unemployment. There must therefore, of course, be better coordination, and I am able to welcome the initiatives the Commission is working on in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the extension of his report on the local dimension of employment adopted by Parliament in July, Mr Schmid rightly insists on the need to develop local and regional job markets. He makes a series of other proposals with which I agree, and I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating him.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I still want to emphasis that, although the European employment strategy has gradually transformed conditions for drafting and implementing national employment policies and enabled better coordination with economic policies, it has not, however, contributed to kick-starting growth or fundamentally changing the employment situation. So, is this a question of method or a matter of choice?</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government have opted for liberal choices by favouring the speeding-up of deregulation and liberalisation, wage moderation, and flexibility and insecurity in the labour market. I therefore believe that the chasm has deepened between the stated objectives on employment and social life within our committee here and the guidelines for the economic policies implemented in each EU Member State. Allow me to give a few pertinent examples. In France, restructuring is being speeded up, and redundancies and relocation are being imposed in several sectors. A substantial number of redundancies are due to take place in the new economy following the bursting of the IT bubble. Thousands of Vivendi group employees are anxious. They know that they will not have the same redundancy payments as their former employer, Jean-Marie Messier. Daewoo, which received bonuses and subsidies in Lorraine, is now moving to China. Total Fina Elf, which has made huge profits, is skimping on compensation to casualties of the AZF disaster in Toulouse and is considering a social plan involving 1500 employees of its subsidiary, Atofina. Alcatel has announced 23 000 job losses by the end of 2003. In the textiles sector, within Alstom and Avantis, businesses have closed or are starting to close.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, I believe the problem we are facing is not so much juggling economy, employment and social considerations as the possible need to review the economy. Every day, experience shows us that there can be no true social and employment policy that responds to employees’ interests, the needs of the people, while economic policies remain tightly corseted by the stability pact and remain based on exacerbated competition and reduced labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the subject of employment is at the heart of citizens’ concerns and we must do all we can to combat unemployment effectively and create jobs, which to my mind means we must put an end to the dominance of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">No real progress can be made, however, if the citizens themselves are not involved in decisions, if there is no effective social dialogue on the challenges of European construction, which are far more wide-reaching than the institutional aspects currently being addressed by the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bouwman (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmid, thank you for the report and thank you for looking into the situation. I should like to make a few critical observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as has been mentioned a number of times today, we are now on the brink of a slow but steady economic downturn. Member States where, until recently, an economic miracle was unfolding – the Netherlands being one example of this – are now faced with rapid decline in employment, while the same measures are still being applied. It is actually regrettable that we talk about creating 10 million jobs – in the knowledge that this largely depends on the economic climate – but cannot gauge accurately whether, and if so, how, this is related to policy. However, we still believe that measures to assist reintegration into work, for example, can definitely have a sustainable effect. If these were not in place, we would be in trouble. But as I said before, we are not certain.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Luxembourg process has, in fact, been overtaken by the Lisbon process to a certain extent, and there are a number of other processes running parallel to it as well. We believe it is useful to maintain the four-pillar structure as it is now, not least because a number of underlying guidelines have not yet been elaborated. I will mention two.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one, which falls within the pillar of adaptability, is quality of labour and quality of the organisation of work. I find it distressing that we have been talking about creating more jobs for years, yet far too little attention is being paid to the whole aspect of better-quality jobs. We have wonderful documents on the subject, but this is as far as it goes. We have no further details worked out, no plans to put them into practice, certainly no programme, and we have no money put aside for this. This is distressing at a time when one takes part in a fifty-plus fair and is surrounded by hundreds of people, and one talks about the need for increasing participation of the elderly in the labour market. Statements you hear at a time like this are: ‘So what are the jobs involved? Will I be required do the same job as I did before? No, never, give me voluntary work any day’. Or you may be facing cross-border workers in a room of 600 people who say: ‘Yes, very nice, this free movement between Belgium and the Netherlands, but how about adapting the social security systems?’ This is an underdeveloped area.</p>
<p class="contents">I could quite easily go on like this for a while and fill my 3 minutes very quickly. I think we should persist with the open coordination method, but should at the same time consider very critically whether it should be applied to other areas, and many more, without any further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of policy coordination, it would be good to work on this very hard in the near future. There are debates coming up in the short term about how we will be coordinating this. I will monitor very closely whether the subordination of the employment guidelines compared to the overall guidelines for economic policy, as enshrined in the Treaty, is not overshooting its target too much and whether the right balance is maintained. I think this is urgently required. This could mean that we will need to bring elements of current economic policy into line with a number of elements of these other objectives. This means balancing things out, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is patently clear that parliaments must be interviewed and called on more extensively in order – how shall I put it – to lower the level of this sort of work across the European organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commissioner for some of the hints she has given us on what she hopes to achieve in the coming year with regard to these guidelines and strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs. Any model where a forced system of state employment or superstructure artificially creates employment is doomed to failure. This is because underlying economic development, which ensures that long-lasting, quality jobs can be created, is not there. There is, however, a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects. However, when the role of the entrepreneur or business in creating jobs is taken away, then the reality of the employment-creation quandary is undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">When the overall aspects of the different economies within the European Union and throughout the world are considered, those which have created the best and most numerous jobs are those which focus on five key issues. Firstly, a strong social partnership model whereby all the actors at a national level are involved in determining broad economic policy, as well as social policy. Secondly, where incentives are given to entrepreneurs and to businesses to invest in new jobs, in new infrastructure and in research and development, giving a longer-lasting guarantee to the creation of manufacturing in other service jobs. Thirdly, a very solid and continuously evolving education and training system, because the real tools we should use to adapt our workforce to the present, as well as future, conditions are those of education and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">We often hear in this House and other establishments about the idea of lifelong learning. What does it really mean? Mr Bouwman mentioned that middle-aged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them. There is a depth of knowledge within the European Union, amongst people between the ages of 45 and 60, that is going untapped, a resource that is being lost because of ignorance, because of a lack of innovative thinking or simply because of a lack of a properly-structured training programme to allow them to adapt to the new market forces and employment opportunities available.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an old saying: give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for life. That must be the underlying basis of our strategies with regard to the quality of jobs, work and employment opportunities available – the kinds of skills that we give to people.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns competitiveness. It may not be a popular thing to say in this House, particularly when we are discussing social affairs, but unless an economy is competitive, it is not going to be able to deal with the fractures of the market in which it is operating. It is not going to attract inward investment from companies and it is not going to be able to prevent the relocations of industries from that economy to other economies where there is more competitiveness or better conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point, which is not often mentioned and which is not paid due recognition, is flexibility – the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first started that the numbers of people in employment in the European Union in the information technology sector would be as high as they are today? Likewise, who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first implemented that the number of long-term unemployed would still continue to be the same five years later? If anything, we have failed those people who are the most vulnerable – the long-term unemployed – by what we have put in place over the last five years. We have failed them, failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the overall strategy a number of things jump out – colleagues on the other side of the House may disagree with this interpretation, but this is my opinion. Firstly, we need to narrow down the guidelines. We need to ensure that they provide the ideal focus needed to attack the areas that we recognise as being the most important. Secondly, we need to give a longer timespan for the guidelines to work. Instead of revising them every year, why not make it every three or four years to ensure again that they can be seen to operate within the mechanisms and systems that they are emerging from?</p>
<p class="contents">Next, as many speakers have mentioned, there is a need to coordinate the broad economic policies with regard to employment strategy, to ensure that the two match. Some people say that there is a tension between these two ideals. However, in reality, unless they are working in parallel and in coordination with each other, maximum results will not be achieved, i.e. maximum economic growth and development and maximum employment of those ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that we need to continue investing in people, because no matter how many figures and statistics are put before us the bottom line is that we are talking about one single individual person who has lost out on an opportunity within the European Union. If, by our discussions here tonight and our work over the next year each of us could get one single person into a quality job we could achieve a lifetime's work because we have helped our fellow human beings to help themselves and they in turn can be the trainers, educators and ambassadors of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we must give this report a ringing endorsement, but we must also ensure that we do not tie our hands. Future ideas must be flexible and able to adapt to the new society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Schmid, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate, highlights the positive effects and also some of the less successful aspects of the European Employment Strategy in the last five years. One of the problems that needs to be resolved is the poor transposition of the Strategy at the decision-making level in the field of employment. The open method of coordination is an important instrument for the implementation of this strategy. As everyone knows, this was designed for sectors in which the Member States retain their autonomy. Differences still remain, however, between national interests and European interests, hence the suggestion that every government should incorporate the national action plan into the development of common policies in the field of employment. The active support of the social partners and their contribution to the implementation and the integration of the Strategy’s priorities into their annual programmes is particularly relevant in areas such as lifelong learning, active ageing, equality between men and women and the modernisation of the organisation of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Account must also be taken of the consequences of enlargement for the current labour market in the European Union. If we are going to be able to improve the current situation between the common global policy at European level and the adoption of policies at national level, adjustments must be made to economic development, by harnessing human resources and creating new institutional structures, but also by strengthening the entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, the National Employment Plan transposes the content of the Strategy to the Portuguese situation in an attempt to respond to the new challenges. In recent years, the Portuguese labour market has generally performed well. Structural weaknesses still remain, however, which only a coordinated medium and long-term strategy, with the active participation of the social partners, will enable us to overcome. Amongst these weaknesses I would highlight:</p>
<p class="contents">- the low level of training,</p>
<p class="contents">- the significant effects of long-term and extremely long-term unemployment,</p>
<p class="contents">- the existence of a group with special difficulties in rejoining the labour market, comprising young people, older workers, women, ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities,</p>
<p class="contents">- a sectoral and entrepreneurial structure with serious shortcomings,</p>
<p class="contents">- low productivity,</p>
<p class="contents">- considerable regional inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to emphasise that, in order for economic and national employment policies to be effectively coordinated and coherent, and to guarantee the effective achievement of the European Employment Strategy, the possibilities of the open method of coordination must be improved and exploited, without losing sight of the requirement for this method always to make transparency its top priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1997, around 10 million new jobs have been created. This is not enough, in terms of either quantity or quality. We agree, however, that the Employment Guidelines need to be made more efficient; they must not be extended, but they need to be more transparent and they ought to have more binding force.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not wish, for the time being in any case, to change the pillar structure. However, we do think that it ought to be overhauled. In previous years, Parliament has often offered new suggestions with this in mind and also pointed to shortcomings. We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented. We are aware that some Member States put up so-called passive resistance to the Commission. For once this too needs to be clearly stated.</p>
<p class="contents">The assessment of the first and fourth pillars was favourable. With your permission, I should like nevertheless to examine this with a more critical eye. On the basis of my own experience in the Member States I would say that the first pillar – employability, which deals above all with further education and training – is still far too haphazard, arbitrary and shortsighted. We need continuous professional training, and at the end of the day this means employees having a right to further training, and not only when they are 50 or 55 years old, but also when they are only 30 or 35.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth pillar – equal opportunities – has been warmly praised. I believe that the considerable success we have been able to see here is also due to the fact, Commissioner, that equal opportunities policy has been supported on several occasions by anti-discrimination legislation. Entrepreneurship and adaptability are still judged to be deficient. It seems to me that many employers still have not even realised that they too are expected to show flexibility and make changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund is certainly an effective instrument, but we Europeans should also link it to the fulfilment of certain obligations by the Member States. We will probably not be able to manage without European sanctions in the long term. Commissioner, my group stands by your side. The national employment plans are often still seen as secret government documents, their contents unknown to national Members of Parliament and the public. That is why, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, we need codecision at EU level and legislative proposals to provoke debate and decisions at national level. As social democrats we will be happy to support you in this quest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why this is, in my view, such an important item on the EU's agenda. I should like to thank Mr Schmid and Mr Mann warmly for the critical eye they have cast over five years of European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of crucial importance to us in Parliament to have our voices heard now, particularly because it is reported that the Commission will be producing a proposal for employment guidelines in 2003. I, for my part, should like to make the following observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, the Commission admits unhesitatingly that the European employment strategy cannot take all the credit for the increase in employment over the past couple of years. This worries me greatly, because at present, we are clearly heading for a recession, and this is exactly a time when we need an effective strategy. If, therefore, it is not clear whether the policy works, is it useful to retain this strategy? The question also arises as to what exactly the European Union's role is. Is it a matter of subsidiarity? It is therefore high time sound indicators were developed and the statistics were updated more effectively. Only then can we really discern what works and what does not. In the meantime, it is a fateful sign that the Court of Auditors will, on Friday, have very critical things to say about the EU's local employment projects in terms of the objectives, how they are monitored, and the inspection of financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there are women. From the Commission communication, it appears that older employees and women still get a rough deal in the area of employment. Although over the past five years, employment for women has increased by 4.3% to 54.9% – a very minor increase after all – the jobs involved are mainly part-time and without any real prospects. The glass ceiling may have become a little more fragile, but it is still in place. However, it is of course completely unacceptable that wage differences still amount to an average of 16%. In addition, one of the main headaches for the working woman is combining family with work. Although Member States have paid increasing attention to parental leave and childcare over the past few years, I think that more is needed. In many Member States, the public is struggling with the notion that the husband can also apply for parental leave. The househusband is viewed with suspicion. I think it is up to the Union to try to change this. In terms of best practices<span class="italic">, </span>I believe that a country such as Sweden can certainly be held up as an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the older employee too is still given too little consideration. Lifelong learning often passes them by, while this is, in fact, very important. It is extremely important, in my view, to develop a sound, effective and verifiable strategy, certainly in the light of the pending enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the jobs created during these years have been precarious, part-time or very short-term, and which fail to guarantee that equal rights and opportunities will be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the report by Herman Schmid, whom I wish to congratulate on his work, unemployment remains at high levels, and long-term unemployment in particular is one of the main causes of social exclusion in Europe, to which we can add precarious and poorly paid work. Women are still the worst affected, with average salaries still being considerably lower than those of men, and women still experience considerable difficulty in being promoted to more senior and executive positions.</p>
<p class="contents">The continuance of the restrictive monetary policies of the Stability Pact, the cuts in public investment, the insistence on privatisation, specifically of public services, relegate social and job creation policies to second place, and this is the current situation. Priority is still also being given to Community policies in the fields of competition, fisheries and agriculture that fail to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises or family-run smallholdings and of small-scale and coastal fishing, which contribute to exacerbating unemployment and prevent quality employment from being maintained. The same thing is happening with the restructuring and relocation of undertakings, specifically of multinationals, in a flagrant breach of respect for workers’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly significant that there is widespread lack of knowledge in the Member States about the European Employment Strategy and that their national plans do not contain quantitative objectives, specifically employment rates for women – as defined at the Lisbon Summit – and nor are these plans being presented in the national parliaments or debates held on their content.</p>
<p class="contents">Account must, therefore, be taken of these issues if we are to achieve positive results in the creation of jobs with rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what is important is that all the Member States are starting to change the way they design their national policies, mainly by shifting their priorities from managing unemployment to managing an increase in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmid's report highlights a series of issues which our committee voted in favour of, the purpose of which is to supplement and enhance the Commission communication so as to strengthen this strategy which started in Luxembourg. I should like to focus in my speech on a number of issues which other honourable Members have also raised this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the involvement of local regional authorities and non-governmental organisations is less than satisfactory. The Commissioner referred to local action plans submitted and implemented by local agencies which might set an example, but they are, I think, the exception rather than the rule. I think, as Mr Andersson said, that we need to study these examples and find out exactly how and why they benefited some regions and not others.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention something that has happened in my country, which has made me sit up and think. Greece is preparing for local and regional elections and absolutely no-one has highlighted the part which local agencies can play in creating jobs. Everyone trumpets how important they are in keeping the place clean, creating green spaces, with the odd allusion to social policy for good measure; but never that they can mobilise local forces and create jobs. And as for non-governmental organisations, they are even worse off and, unless they are officially involved in social dialogue, local society will not, I fear, look on them as serious, efficient partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is unemployment among women, which the spokesman for the Committee on Women's Rights, Mr Mann, highlighted. I think that here too, despite the increase in the number of jobs, the Member States need to show serious commitment and consistency in adopting quantitative targets for making qualitative improvements to women's jobs and creating new jobs. This relates directly to the issue raised this evening, an issue which I too vigorously endorse, namely the need to coordinate employment policy and social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is here that the serious question of creating the conditions needed in order to reconcile work and family life raises its head. This is a question of social policy, for which the Member States are responsible; but it is also a question of social responsibility, an issue of concern to the European Parliament and for which the social partners are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as we can see, huge efforts are needed to ensure that the employment strategy operates at several levels, not forgetting the serious role which national and – where they exist – regional parliaments should play; because employment policy really is an issue to which they have paid scant attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why this stocktaking exercise actually does nothing other than invite us to join up procedures even more closely, and to support the Commission's streamlining initiative in economic, employment and social policy so that we gain even better instruments in these fields. We have to make it quite clear that we agree that if we wish to respond successfully to the challenges coordination has to be a European task. After all, these challenges are greater than ever before when we see that successes in employment are being cancelled out by weak economic growth and that poor labour market figures are in turn dampening growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We must finally get used to the idea that we need to have an economic policy at EU level that also has to meet employment policy objectives, and that we need to pursue a modern EU employment policy that secures sustainable and high-quality growth for everyone. This bond needs to be emphasised as we look towards the future. I have to say that quite honestly I really hope that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference will succeed in making a breakthrough in this regard, so as to enshrine the Lisbon process in a constitution, in particular with the aim of full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make three further comments on practical and comprehensive actions which seek actually to increase employment intensity in the European Union and which are in particular also very important from an economic policy point of view. Firstly, employment intensity can certainly also be increased further through taxation measures, for example by applying low rates of value-added tax to labour-intensive services. It is disappointing that so little progress has been recorded here.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it should also be said that initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises need to be more closely interlinked than has been possible in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and this concerns the Employment Guidelines in particular, we should also consider whether we might establish a link with the guidelines in competition policy, that is in policy on state aids, where we of course have specific rules, so as to have exemptions to the ban on state aid when small and medium-sized enterprises are being promoted or jobs created. The approaches found there are, however, not necessarily reflected in the Employment Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines are not necessarily reflected in these rules either. In my view this is really vital, because aid is also a significant aspect, just as competition policy as a whole is an important policy area for promoting employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, however, such a strategy should prohibit all large companies from making mass redundancies along the lines of those currently being implemented by the extremely wealthy trust, Alcatel. Everyone knows that the responsibility for unemployment lies principally with these large companies, which are not only failing to create the extra jobs they should, but are eliminating jobs purely for the benefit of shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, any employment strategy should commit the Member States to taking the initiative in creating the hundreds of thousands of jobs lacking in all the Member States of the European Union, in hospitals, the public transport sector, the postal sector, or in education. It would also be in society’s interests for the Member States to set up large-scale projects to build low-cost, high-quality accommodation. The current policy, however, which consists of privatising public sectors left, right and centre, is exactly the opposite. Under these conditions, talk about an employment strategy is nothing but pious hopes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, like many of my fellow Members, I consider that the European employment strategy we have known over the past five years has, to varying degrees, perhaps, depending on the regions, been effective and has benefited the citizens of Europe. However, I believe the time has now come to review its structure and also to propose a new strategy that takes full account of the coordination of macro-economic, social and employment policies. From this perspective, we have just reviewed every aspect of European employment strategy during the last five years and proposals have been made regarding the guidelines to follow. I would like to focus on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns the necessary relationship between the European employment strategy and national employment plans and in this respect, I believe it is a question of the relationship with citizens and the understanding citizens may have of European strategies that affect them. In actual fact, this relationship takes place through the intermediary of the national parliaments, both in giving their consent and in implementing the European guidelines. In this regard, I believe the situation to be something of a paradox. The employment situation is deteriorating. The European Union’s efforts to set up employment strategies should target people in difficulty. However, those who should be able to benefit from the actions are in fact the most disillusioned, the most critical and those who least understand our positions and the proposals we are making. I therefore think that if we try to implement a coherent strategy, which fully involves the national parliaments by allowing them to debate national employment plans and make them their own, we will contribute to democratising European procedures, in particular with regard to the European employment strategy, and legitimise our actions in the eyes of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point – on which, I believe, everyone agrees – is that, in order to be effective, the European employment policy should really be an integral part, in socio-economic terms, of European policies. The objectives of full employment, education, lifelong learning, all of which have been cited, are in fact parallel objectives which largely fall outside the scope of the guidelines for each sector alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in conclusion, I think we need to review the subject of the social instruments used by Europe. In fact, even if we reach an agreement on the objectives to be achieved, we still need to provide ourselves with suitable instruments with which to implement them. On this subject, I believe we must reconsider using the codecision procedure and majority decision-making with regard to employment policy. Although the open coordination method has proved useful, I believe it must be used to complement the other legislative instruments, as was originally intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Serious account will be taken of Parliament's proposals and opinions and I should like to touch on four points which were raised several times this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the basis on which the employment strategy is being developed. It is a combination of competitiveness and cohesion. Clearly, the employment strategy takes account of the needs of companies, both large and small, and the needs of the workers. The doubt expressed by a number of honourable Members as to the extent to which it fosters competitiveness is, I think, somewhat exaggerated, given that, if nothing else, the employment strategy has resulted in what are also business-friendly job market reforms. The need to achieve competitiveness and cohesion at one and the same time means, as several honourable Members have pointed out, that we need to couple employment strategies and policies and social policy; in other words, they cannot be segregated and we need to take account of social policy issues every step of the way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the framework, cooperation, updating the employment guidelines and the financial package. Important and serious proposals and approaches have been voiced. I would point out, as several honourable Members have said, that the employment strategy needs to be discriminating, its scope needs to be clear and it should not be incorporated into the economic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is involvement. One of the basic problems we identified during our evaluation was the involvement of national parliaments, which need to assume a more important role, and of social partners and of local authorities, as regards the regional and local application of the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to the method itself as a tool, as Mrs Gillig quite rightly pointed out; a tool which we are using for the first time. The open method of coordination has no separate entry in the Treaty; however, it has been a very successful method, which is why we have used it in another two procedures, exclusion and pensions, and we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference will perhaps give us the chance to finalise it and use it more efficiently in other policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
