<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, following the failure of the EU to renew a fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco, it became clear that there would be massive socio-economic impacts within the Community. The previous agreement with Morocco expired in November 1999. At that time, this had been the biggest international agreement between the Community and any third country. A great many EU vessels and jobs relied upon it, primarily in Spain but also in Portugal. In the absence of a new agreement, a significant number of Community vessels from Galicia, Andalucia and Portugal that operated within this framework were forced to stop their fishing activities. Recognising the difficulties caused by the lack of any new fisheries agreement, the Community agreed to set aside over EUR 190 million to promote the conversion of fishing vessels that had operated in Moroccan waters. 94.6% of this money was set aside for Spain, and the rest for Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster occurred last November and the shores of Galicia were covered in layers of black oil, we began to search for emergency aid to alleviate the catastrophic suffering of the fishing communities in this region. We discovered that EUR 30 million of the money set aside to deal with the Moroccan problem was, at that point, still unspent. The European Parliament therefore agreed at its plenary session in December 2002 that we should immediately re-programme this money to help with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster in Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the fact that the Moroccan fund had been underspent raised some important questions. At a meeting of the Committee on Fisheries in February 2003, representatives of the industry and of the Andalucian regional government described the problems they encountered in the implementation of this Regulation. It quickly became clear that the criteria according to which fishermen could claim this aid was far too complex and had proven to be so rigid that very few fisherman had in fact managed to benefit from any of this money.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry representatives told our Committee that potential beneficiaries are losing out on compensation measures due to overly stringent Commission deadlines and rules. For example, public aid is granted only to fishermen who have undertaken to scrap vessels, change the purpose of their vessels, or agreed to the permanent transfer of a vessel to a third country through joint venture agreements. In particular, crew members who have lost their jobs cannot apply for the individual premium of EUR 12 000 unless the owner decides to transfer or scrap the vessel. This means that many fishermen living in the regions which were affected by the failure of the Morocco agreement have still not received any financial help.</p>
<p class="contents">I need hardly remind the House that in our March 2003 plenary session in Strasbourg two weeks ago, by an overwhelming majority of 507 votes in favour to 6 votes against, the European Parliament supported a resolution proposing EUR 150 million to be paid as compensation to fisherman affected by the draconian cod recovery measures now in place in the Irish Sea and the North Sea. I know that we are still negotiating with the Commission and the Council as to where this emergency aid might come from, but I trust that we are simply not going to repeat the mistakes that were made with the Moroccan fund. We must ensure that in future when we identify the need for urgent aid to the fisheries sector, it is delivered in a way that is both fairly targeted and quickly completed. Let us make sure that there is a minimum of red tape and a minimum of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I just returned this afternoon from Galicia where I attended meetings and site visits with members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to see for ourselves the clean-up operation in the wake of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. We heard all too vividly the desperate plight of the fishing communities who had been forced to tie up their boats, through no fault of their own, since last November. Despite the fact that this House agreed to re-programme EUR 30 million last December, none of that money has so far been released. Why not? Who is working on the details of this aid package? Where are the log jams? Let us cut the red tape and get the aid moving! Let us learn from these lessons that have been identified under the Morocco agreement and get things right in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The same cannot be said, however, for the way funds are being used on social measures, and this is where there are problems. The reason why the fishermen are not making full use of the funds provided for social measures is that they are unable to fulfil certain of the conditions in our regulation. The fact is that fishermen who have lost their jobs because of the failure to extend the Agreement with Morocco, receive a compensation payment only if their employer allows his ship to be broken up or if he sets up a joint enterprise. If, though the ship continues to fish in other third-country waters – or indeed in Community waters – for example, under a private licence, they are not entitled to any payment in compensation. That is also essentially logical, as such ships are still active in the fisheries sector and it can therefore be assumed that their crews continue to be employed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now agreed with the Spanish authorities that they will inform the Commission as to where and for what reasons social problems arise as a result of ships not being broken up, and no entitlement to structural funds exists. On the subject of items 1 and 2 in your motion for a resolution, I can, then, tell honourable Members that we will come to a decision without delay as soon as we have all the data we have requested from the Spanish Government and have the opportunity to examine it. Item 3 of your resolution does, of course, have something to do with this. If the Commission comes to the conclusion that we should decide in favour, we will of course also modify the repayment of some of these sums in such a way as to ensure that the fishermen receive equal treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, though there are not many Members present in the Chamber at this time of night, I would like to point out that the renewal of the agreement with Morocco was one of the most important objectives of the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">When this agreement was not achieved, we went out of our way to ensure that the budget that had been earmarked for the agreement would go instead to the fisherman affected. After some very difficult political and budgetary negotiations we secured this money. The practical application of the regulations approved demonstrated to us the need to improve them. We did not want any potential beneficiary to be deprived of even a single euro. We worked with great determination to rectify the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the purpose of the resolution we will vote on tomorrow, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries. The proposal we have tabled has been improved by the contributions of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. A consensus was reached rapidly, and I think we should all congratulate ourselves on this. I believe the Commission should accept in full the proposals we will vote on tomorrow. These will amend Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 and ensure better social cover.

On that occasion, Parliament agreed a series of amendments that seem to be very similar to the proposal before us today. They sought to make the regulation more flexible and to convert this particular Community fleet. As I am sure the Commissioner is aware, the fleet is based in Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and Portugal, It was left without their traditional fishing-ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council adopted this Regulation accepting, though only to a limited extent, some of Parliament’s amendments. In due course, the weaknesses of the text adopted became clear. As we had anticipated, it proved too rigid. It did not allow a significant part of the sector concerned to access the aid for conversion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries has visited Galicia and Andalusia over the last two years. It noted that the non-renewal of the agreement seriously affected 400 boats, 4 300 fishermen and whole regions of Galicia and Andalusia. A large number of associated industries were brought to a virtual standstill. Last December, EUR 30 million was allocated to those affected by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. The allocation of this money made it clear that it was not possible to spend it and that this regulation was inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution tabled by the Committee on Fisheries rightly calls on the Commission to put forward an amendment to improve this regulation and make it sufficiently flexible. We call on the Commission to present a proposal to amend the present regulation as a matter of urgency. We need this to solve the problems we are currently encountering in applying the regulation to fishermen. Above all, aid should not be linked to shipowners’ decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission told us a few weeks ago that it could not propose amendments to the regulation because the Spanish authorities had not submitted the required information to the Commission. When she met with the Committee on Fisheries, the Director-General of Fisheries of the Andalusian Regional Government told us that the Spanish authorities had not submitted the necessary information on the proportion of fishermen from this region who had received benefits during the six months’ ban to the Regional Government. The authorities in Andalusia did not therefore even know exactly how many fishermen were entitled to aid. Consequently, they had to establish six offices in the most affected ports to provide information on this aid. This entailed employing 12 people, an investment of EUR 721 000 from their own funds and the provision of a free telephone service. Commissioner, in Andalusia alone, fishermen have made 800 visits and 1 500 enquires.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not asking for more money. We are asking for a better regulation so that the money allocated can be used efficiently for the purpose for which it was intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Community Fisheries Agreement with Morocco expired on 30 November 1999. Portugal neighbours that country, has obvious maritime connections, and a considerable part of its fishing fleet was directly involved in the fishing activities covered by this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Portuguese and Spanish fishermen have been hard hit by the non-renewal of the agreement because in many cases they have been unable to fish, which means that they have been unable to work. I do not wish to return to the political assessment we made at the time of the failure headed by Commissioner Franz Fischler, who has today completely ignored the Portuguese fishermen. What I wish to emphasise is the inaction and the lack of diligence at the time I have referred to, to which we can add the ineptitude of the way in which the measures of support for the ship-owners and fishermen affected were drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">These people have been denied the right to fish and to work, and although they have been compensated with support measures for fleet conversion and for individual premiums, they have come up against Community legislation that is quite inflexible, inappropriate and whose implementation involves difficulties that are almost impossible to resolve. It is regrettable that legislation should have been drafted in the aim of resolving situations such as this one but, instead, has further complicated the lives of the fishermen affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of flexibility of the 2001 Regulation and the various administrative difficulties concerning the deadlines set for implementation have prevented or could invalidate access by fishermen to the exceptional support actions that have been planned, particularly to socioeconomic measures, the allocation of which turns on requirements that their beneficiaries cannot meet.</p>
<p class="contents">It has, therefore, become crucial for the Commission to set things right and what is needed urgently is a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation in order to resolve the implementing problems that have arisen, particularly a change to the allocation requirements for the premium due to the fishermen. In fact, making the allocation of the individual premium of EUR 12 000 to anyone who is not a shipowner, but merely an employee, dependent on scrapping vessels amounts to taking away with one hand what is given with the other. I shall conclude, Mr President, Commissioner, in the hope that this situation is duly corrected and that the Commission rapidly submits its proposal in the aim of effectively correcting the injustices created following the expiry of the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Morocco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think two of these are extremely relevant. The first, and perhaps the most important – to which various Members have already referred – is the excessive rigidity with regard to the payment conditions for aid of EUR 12 000 to crew members. As we know, in order for these people to receive the money, the vessels on which they worked must have been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures. And yet the Commissioner said that the Commission shared the view that if the vessels have not been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures it is because they are fishing elsewhere and the crew members are therefore employed. This is an erroneous assumption, however, because although in some cases shipowners do actually manage to send their vessels to fish in other fishing grounds, they are only able to make a partial profit, or to provide a partial alternative to what they had previously in the Moroccan fishing grounds. In other cases, the shipowners themselves are waiting for an alternative for the future. Whereas they are waiting or whereas they have partial alternatives, the crew members or fishermen of the vessels that previously fished in Morocco are now unemployed and inactive. This is why this situation must be reviewed as a matter of urgency and why crew members, who are entirely blameless in the matter, should not be sacrificed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element of rigidity concerns the fact that, at the time the agreement with Morocco lapsed, some shipowners were building vessels to fish in that country’s waters. As the agreement lapsed, these shipowners had to convert these vessels and refit them for other fishing grounds. This refit of the vessels entailed increased costs, which were borne by the shipowners. I think it would be fair, under the current regulation or under any other, for Community co-financing to be provided to cover this rise in shipowners’ costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by saying, as other Members have done, that these matters must be resolved. They will not cost any more money; what is needed in order to resolve these problems is for flexibility to be shown. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also say that before I came to this debate today I looked at the latest data on the utilisation of this budget line, with which the Commission regularly provides us, and I discovered that, apart from initial advance payments, no interim payments have yet been recorded. This is the state of affairs after the programme has been in action for more than a year! I also think that this piece of data, more than any other, is extremely significant with regard to the difficulties that the programme is facing in getting off the ground. And as our colleagues explained to us so brilliantly, especially Mrs Miguélez Díaz, the issue is not the need to implement the programme. This need does exist, but the problem is that it is not given due consideration in the blueprint for the regulation, which is too cumbersome and was not drawn up with the reality of the situation in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commissioner to take due account of what our fellow Members have said, which I think is extraordinarily appropriate. We would find it extremely regrettable if we were to face yet another blatant case of budgetary underutilisation, of the inability of the European institutions to respond to a real need. I therefore call on the Commissioner to review this problem as thoroughly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there have to date been no complaints or problems relating to the flow of funds in Portugal, where full use has been made of the money available; nor has the Portuguese Government had any complaint to make to us about anything not working. Secondly, it is true that we have been paying in instalments so far, but the reason why the final instalment has not been paid is that we have not so far received a request for payment from either Spain or Portugal. We can act only when the appropriate applications have been made, and so the Commission is perhaps the wrong body to which to address these complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
