<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Madam President, we are now discussing this directive for the second time this year, and once again, a large number of amendments have been tabled. This would have been completely unnecessary, of course, if the Council had taken more notice, or indeed any notice, of our first reading and the amended proposal from the Commission, which went some way towards our goal. I am happy to say that since then – partly through the good offices of the Commission – the entire Presidency has shown willing and I believe the positions have moved somewhat closer together after all. Legislative procedures do not take place in a vacuum; as the negotiations for the framework agreement on tobacco control in the World Health Organisation have shown, there is a worldwide trend towards increasingly far-reaching control of what the World Health Organisation refers to as the tobacco epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, how far should we take this? How far are we allowed to take it? I witnessed the concern expressed in our Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the implications of the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 October for the directive concerning tobacco advertising, and I echo the view that it will have a considerable impact on this directive and also on EU public health policy in general. I also feel that the arguments for closer involvement of the European Parliament, i.e. greater transparency and better democratic control, have gone from strength to strength. Adjustments had to be made to the draft directive and some have been proposed this time round as well. I just think it is a shame that our Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been unable to make a constructive contribution in terms of the content of the directive. I would be most interested to hear the Commissioner’s view of the issues surrounding this legal basis. I think it is important for us to know what he thinks. The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market whilst maintaining a high standard of public health and consumer protection, and building on existing legislation and advanced scientific knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must strengthen the functioning of the internal market, for example by mutual recognition of test results and the development of common standards. Those who adhere to them would not then be required to fulfil various additional conditions depending on which country they happen to be in. This is not a crusade against smokers, nor is it a ban on smoking. That would be undesirable and would also be unworkable in any case. What we are aiming to do is to achieve an enhanced sense of personal responsibility, and hopefully help deter young people from smoking. According to the World Health Organisation, there are 1400 smoking-related deaths annually in the European Union. That is almost one per minute. Eighty per cent of new smokers each year are below the age of 18, and the majority of them are young women who predominately smoke the so-called ‘light’ cigarettes. So it is vital to impose a ban on these misleading descriptions, and the product must be subject to controls. It is the most readily available product in the European Union, but we know more about the contents of a pot of jam and the ingredients of cola than we do about the average cigarette. This directive will ensure that we at last get to know what cigarettes contain and why. Once in possession of these facts, we must proceed to draw up a common list of permitted ingredients of the kind that already exists in incomplete form in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Germany. However, I sense that the Commission is reluctant to take this step and do not really understand why. This Parliament would like to see a commitment to drawing up this list <span class="italic">before </span>2005, during the tenure of this Commission, or at least to see it proposed by then. We therefore insist on the Member States providing the necessary information in good time. Provision must be made to ban at an earlier stage ingredients that increase physiological dependency. It is very important to establish maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels. However, I do wonder whether our efforts are going to be able to do a lot for public health standards in the long run. Nicotine addiction is a complex matter. The harmful effects are largely caused by the tar, carbon monoxide, and other ingredients, and we need to find out more about the damaging, but perhaps even the positive, aspects of nicotine addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that what is unhealthy for European consumers is also unhealthy for other consumers and therefore ought not to be exported. I <span class="italic">am</span> willing to consider establishing a derogation for this purpose, lasting three years or so. During this time, companies would be able to make the necessary production and marketing modifications, so that jobs are not needlessly transferred to countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Health warnings need to be improved. The European Parliament has gratefully made use of Canadian research findings, and I feel we will go further down this line in time. We are not ready to go that far at this stage. That said, we <span class="italic">do </span>feel that health warnings should be at least as big as they are in Poland, where they now cover 30% of the packet and I am disappointed that the Council did not want to go further than 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I hope this Parliament will support the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, given the clear internal market objective to regulate the free movement of tobacco products in the Community, Article 95 of the Treaty constitutes the appropriate legal basis for this proposal. Secondly, there is no doubt that a better motivation of the effects of this provision on the internal market will strengthen it. In particular, there is a need to reinforce the motivation of the provisions of Article 3 on carbon monoxide maximum authorised yields in the recitals of the directive. They should better reflect how they aim to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods or distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to Article 3, allowing manufacture in the European Union only of products respecting this directive amounts to an export ban for products with higher tar, nicotine or carbon monoxide levels. The European Parliament has therefore proposed to add Article 133 dealing with the common commercial policy to Article 95 as the legal basis. The Commission could agree to this solution subject to the insertion of a specific article in the text of the directive which would explicitly regulate exports as such. This would be the case, for example, of an amendment on the transitional period to be applied to exports of cigarettes not complying with Article 3 of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would have no hesitation in choosing the latter. In other words, we would make it our business to reduce the maximum yields of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, then we would go for decisive and striking warnings, and ban misleading wording. We would also opt for efficient measures to deal with certain technical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this clear course of action, we must also be conscious of the fact that we are the Parliament of a Union that sets great store by the principles of the constitutional State, which means that we must recognise the limitations of our authority, i.e. we must know what the limits are to the authority we derive from Article 95, the legal basis we are invoking for the new tobacco directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming I have read the judgment that annuls the advertising directive correctly, we must verify whether there is a European market for tobacco products. Then we must verify whether there are obstacles to the internal market, or whether they could arise, realistically speaking. Thirdly, we must check whether the stipulations we approve will really help to improve the functioning of the internal market and whether they are commensurate with the goal to be achieved. Fourthly, we must see whether the choices we face in terms of content will contribute to a high standard of public health protection, because that is another of our duties pursuant to Article 95.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I do not see any problem with this directive. So I am extremely content with the answer I received in advance from the Commissioner, to a question which has also been raised in our group, as to how we should deal with the proposal to immediately incorporate an export ban on products we do not want to use ourselves, into this directive. If this can be settled in a legally conclusive manner by adding a reference to the legal basis of Article 133 of the Treaty then I feel we should all support this solution, and I would also hope that by so doing, we will not encounter annulment rights at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the fact is that if it should transpire now, or further down the line, that we are not going to be able to secure the export ban, then we must do everything in our power to see that this is done subsequently. Because for ethical reasons, nobody in Europe can accept that products we do not consider good enough for ourselves, and that we do not want to allow Europeans to use, <span class="italic">can</span>, without further ado, be exported to Africa, for example. There must be no question of something like that happening. So the ban must be imposed at some point. Let us hope we can do it now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to finish I just have this to say. Mrs Martens was the spokesperson for the PPE-DE Group. There are serious reasons as to why she will arrive a little later here today. She is hoping she will still be in time to round off the list of speakers from the PPE-DE Group. If not, I have also spoken on her behalf. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their way and concept of life, in which the protection of health is becoming increasingly important, are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">At this level, the work undertaken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been truly remarkable, thanks, in particular, to our rapporteur’s work. One thing must be made clear: we are not adopting a legislative framework to fight smoking, which continues to be the largest cause of death in the European Union; at least for the moment this is not possible and I, personally, would have many doubts if we intended to draw on, more or less secretly, an illusory prohibitionist philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonising the national laws concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of smoking products at the highest possible level of health protection is something that we can and must do. As has been pointed out, there are four cornerstones of this directive: limiting the content of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide; banning descriptors of cigarettes – ‘light’ or ‘ultra-light’ – which are universally acknowledged to be misleading; uniform regulations and, where necessary, prohibiting other ingredients and additives which are often responsible for increasing the risks for smokers and, above all, increasing their addiction; quantitative and qualitative reinforcement of the warnings of the gravity of the risk taken when lighting a cigarette and trying to dissuade the young from falling victim to this psycho-physical slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">By merging three pre-existing directives, we are obviously staying strictly within the boundaries of improving the operation of the internal market without, however, renouncing forging ahead with a harm-reduction strategy and curbing a true scourge: smoking, which is costly in both social and economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">During this second reading, we have had two main concerns: firstly, political reconciliation of the aim of protecting health with the nevertheless valid point of view of production and employment. The example of applying new levels of toxic substances to cigarettes exported from the European Union as well, should apply to everyone. To uphold this basic principle, we have, to begin with, proposed extending the legal basis to include Article 133 of the Treaty, but above all, we have postponed the date by which Member States will be obliged to implement it to 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern, of a specifically legal nature, has, on the other hand, encouraged us to increase the interdependence of the harmonisation of the market and the protection of health even further, by meticulously following the recommendations arising from the Court of Justice’s reasons for recently setting aside the Directive on advertising, reasons of which only a biased reading could lead one to conclude that the two aspects are incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore carried out fruitful and important work, especially because the distances from the common position of the Council, but even more so, from the observations which were made in the Council following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, of which we had first-hand experience, are so small that there is a real chance for a swift and effective compromise. To ditch, as someone has proposed, all this work and with it the opportunity to send a positive message to the citizens is, of course, a valid proposal, but at least let us have the courage to do it in the name of an explicit political reason and not hide behind formal homage to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made every effort to achieve the greatest possible unity of Parliament so that it can, as at other times, find the strength to appear to citizens as a sure point of reference, impervious to individual interests. If this proves not to be the case, at least the responsibilities will be clear and easily identifiable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This rule can be applied equally to all recreational but dangerous drugs when no one but the person consuming the drug is likely to be affected. Certainly, there is none more dangerous than tobacco mixed with nicotine and other chemicals to guarantee a very high rate of addition and dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments have the task of ensuring that citizens have the information to make informed decisions and to exercise their free will. Earlier this year, the Canadian Government decided to strengthen its powers of communication with its citizens about tobacco products and overcome the intense lobbying and huge financial interests of the tobacco companies by requiring that cigarette packets in Canada carry pictures depicting some of the health consequences of smoking. Studies have shown that such pictures have a significantly greater effect in conveying concerns about smoking and the health consequences than any written warning.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Members of the House to support the amendment which has been tabled by John Bowis for the PPE-DE Group, Catherine Stihler for the Socialist Group and myself. This seeks to give the governments of European Union Member States strengthened powers to introduce such pictures on cigarette packets in their own countries. I emphasise that we are not insisting that these pictures should be imposed on every Member State. It simply gives Member States an additional right to introduce them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let people have the freedom to choose whether or not to smoke. Let us be absolutely sure that they are informed when they make the decision one way or the other.</p>

Better late than never.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty thousand deaths a year for decades, due to the consequences of using a drug with known side-effects for which doctors and hospital departments know there is only palliative treatment, and nothing is done apart from a few timid information campaigns. Then, when a directive does come along seeking to regulate the distribution of that drug and information about it – I am talking about tobacco – there is an outcry from some Members. But ladies and gentlemen, if you truly acknowledged the health problems linked to tobacco, you would demand a ban on this drug, just as you continue to maintain the bans on other substances despite the fact that, quantitatively, they are far less lethal. You are responsible for the health of millions of citizens, and also for the deaths of thousands of young people who have not been given sufficient information.</p>
<p class="contents">Cases have recently been won in the United States against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning people and lying about the toxicity of their products. Now, in France, the Loire-Atlantique health insurance company has won the right to sue the tobacco industry in the courts. But in the future, just as with contaminated blood and mad cow disease, legal action will be taken against those who knew about it and let it happen, and that means you, us, the decision makers, the legislators.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us do something together, just a small thing in view of how much remains to be done. Let us reduce the levels of nicotine and tar; ban addictive substances, like ammonia which is added to the nicotine to increase addiction to cigarettes; attach legible warnings covering at least 35% of the cigarette packet to alert people to the risks and dangers of tobacco; get rid of lies like ‘light’ and ‘ultra-light’ which encourage young people, especially young women, to smoke in the belief that this makes it less harmful, when medical science now agrees that the upsurge in peripheral small-cell lung cancers which are more insidious, more difficult to diagnose and have even more tragic prognoses is linked to over-consumption of this type of cigarette; evaluate the socio-economic cost of tobacco and transform the subsidies to tobacco producers into real redevelopment subsidies benefiting, for example, the production of cereals to replace meat-and-bone meal; recognise that products intended for export should comply with the same regulations as those intended for the internal European market; raise the price of tobacco because that is a measure which has a direct incidence on consumption, especially by young people; and harmonise tax rates.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this amounts to a great deal, ladies and gentlemen, and it will not really damage the interests of the tobacco industry, which some people would apparently rather protect than public health. Much more needs to be done. In fact, this directive should be extended to products other than cigarettes, like cigars and rolling tobacco, which are no less harmful. The ban on advertising these lethal products should be confirmed, and the collective rules on no-smoking areas should be extended. We have a lot of work to do.</p>

There are also amendments that would discard the whole of Parliament's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of the opinion, however, that there are very significant differences between the issue of tobacco advertising and this directive. We feel it is self-evident that Article 95 should form the legal basis for this directive together with Article 133, as the committee are now proposing in Amendment No 1. The directive on which the proposal builds is based on Article 95 and the issue is, of course, directly concerned with the content of products on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a positive opinion of the contents of the report and support its main points. It is particularly important to establish clear limit values for the hazardous substances contained in the smoke. Amendment No 2 concerning carbon monoxide is, therefore, particularly positive.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also support the proposals concerning the size and wording of the warning text. In this case, there is such a small difference between the different points of view that it should not be difficult to reach a compromise. We are also in favour of the ban on habit-forming additives.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards export from the European Union of cigarettes that are banned within the Union for health reasons, we consider that the only reasonable and consistent solution is to put a stop to this. There is no reason to provide special conditions and extended transitional periods where the export of cigarettes is concerned, as compared with their manufacture for use within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also mentions special brands of cigarettes that are marketed as ‘mild’, ‘light’ and such like. This is a marketing strategy which is often misleading and which gives the false impression that these cigarettes do not carry the same risks as other cigarettes. We do not see any reason for allowing this type of marketing and regard the committee's present position in this area as being in danger of leading to far too many opportunities for exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if subsidies for tobacco-growing are not regulated by this report, it is impossible not to touch on the issue, which constitutes one of the absurdities of the European Union. It is unreasonable for the Union to put the large sums of money into tobacco-growing that it does today. This is inconsistent, and it is becoming expensive. This money could be put to good use elsewhere. Therefore, the only sensible thing to do is to phase out the subsidies gradually and for the farms affected to be given help to convert to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">When this report was previously discussed, the issue of Swedish snuff was brought up. I do not consider there to be any reason to change the current rules, i.e. an exception in the case of Sweden, nor, at the same time, the right of countries which do not wish to sell snuff to uphold their ban. I am therefore pleased that no amendment has been made to that regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not for the first time, no doubt. But this time it seems much more serious than usual. So, once again, I shall deal with the substance and not the form.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the Court of Justice has just repealed the 1998 Directive banning advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products. The Court held that a total ban on tobacco advertising cannot be justified in the name of the proper functioning of the internal market. Now, in contempt of the Treaties, believing it is entrusted with a mission of salvation, our Parliament marches on, head down, to push this text through, come what may.</p>
<p class="contents">That attitude perfectly sums up the defects of our European institutions, always ready to go to any lengths to achieve the ideological goals they have set themselves. But there are rules that have to be respected and we have to remember that. History teaches us that it is dangerous to regard the goal – however noble and virtuous – as superior to the agreed rules. The obstinacy demonstrated here reveals a striking lack of realism. Rather than learn the lessons of the defeat suffered in Luxembourg on 9 October, we persist in taking a legally indefensible attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is profoundly attached to the preservation of public health, but we are worried about the consequences of such a suicidal political position. If we do not change our approach we are likely to kill the directive. Public health must not be put at stake in a power struggle designed to scrape together more new powers every day, to the detriment of the States. Health is too important an issue to be used as a political tool.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what answers are there? There is only one, in our opinion: learn the lessons from the Court of Justice’s decision and recognise that the European Commission unfortunately went much too far in its efforts to distort the treaties. We must also have another look at our copy and redraft it respecting the balance called for by the Treaty</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe he has successfully amalgamated the three existing directives into one new one. It would, of course, have been much nicer if we had not had to concern ourselves with tobacco legislation at all. However, the sad fact is that tobacco is still produced, presented and sold. And although everyone is aware that it is bad for your health, they still use it nonetheless. If tobacco had to be admitted to the European market as a new product, it would certainly be rejected for health reasons. If jam or cola were as harmful as tobacco, they would certainly be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the strict labelling proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy both in terms of the size and the wording of the health warnings on cigarette packets. However, I think the Council’s proposal with regard to the size of the warnings on labels besides those on cigarette packets, is an improvement on Amendment No 25, since the 50 cm² limit is far too close to the surface area of a packet of cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">I still feel that messages such as ‘low-tar’, ‘mild’ and ‘light’ are misleading, so I will, in fact, oppose Amendments Nos 10 and 30.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the ban on adding ammonia or other addictive products will be maintained at second reading. It seems obvious to me that we must not tolerate such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I must sadly point out again that the European tobacco policy is still inconsistent. Tobacco consumption is discouraged on the one hand, yet on the other, in excess of EUR 1 billion is spent on tobacco subsidies annually. I would like to take this opportunity to again express my wish that this will change some day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a large tobacco industry in Northern Ireland, Gallaher's Ltd. If this directive is adopted, at least 300 jobs will be lost. I have studied carefully what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume: "No massive job losses in this sector. It is not understood how a reduction in tar from 12 to 10 mg, as proposed in the present text, would have noticeable employment effects.”</p>
<p class="contents">The key difference, however, between previous and current reductions in tar ceilings is simply that previous reductions in tar ceilings were limited to the EU. Gallaher's has a 25% export volume. If this directive is adopted, 300 jobs will go. It must be said that the manufacturers will sell not one cigarette fewer than they do now, because they will transfer their business outside the European Union. Gallaher's will transfer its business to its Russian factory and the ceilings will be ignored, but we will have exported 300 jobs. The job losses in Gallaher's will affect workers about 47 years old on average. In Northern Ireland, if you lose your job at 47 there is not much chance of getting another job. This is my concern on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This interinstitutional balance is a source of legitimacy for European integration. I would also like to talk about the obligation inherent in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, the Commission has had the obligation, for more than two months, to analyse the judgment and to draw the relevant conclusions from it. The Commissioner today, for the first time, in his very brief intervention, has used the words “no doubt” at least three times and the words “clear” or “clearly” at least three times. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in law, when one feels the need to say that something is clear, and that there is no doubt about it, it is because there is doubt and it is not clear. In this case there is doubt and it is not clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, how can it be said that a justification in Amendment No 2 respects what the Court of Justice has said, when according to that justification, in order to explain the danger to the internal market, several Member States have indicated that, if certain measures are not adopted, they would seek to legislate? Which Member States? Which measures? That is what we expected from the Commission, that they should tell us, that they should explain this to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take some other examples, Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 18. To add the legal basis of Article 133 is legally skilful, but has the Commission really considered Article 131 which is the mother article of external trade policy, and which says that that policy is intended “to increase the competitiveness of our companies”? How does that square with the justification in Amendment No 18, where it says that an exemption period is granted because that could seriously harm our industry? How does that square with that same justification, which says that negotiations must be held within the World Trade Organisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these doubts, these justifiable doubts, which have nothing to do with any shady or mysterious friendship with some company or other, are the reason for the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and I remember that it was 18 votes to 9. Although I was not present, my vote, of course, supported the Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is Parliament and the Council who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine, amongst other things, a suitable legal basis for it. Therefore, it is not a question of accusing the Commission of having committed any irregularity.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it cannot be accused of any irregularity because the Commission, in this case, has simply tabled a proposal for a directive which revises three previous directives on the content of certain products in tobacco and certain warnings on the packaging of those products.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there is really nothing new here. The only new thing is that there has been a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, of 5 October, in which the Court of Justice says that, with regard to another completely different directive, that is, the Directive on tobacco advertising, the legal basis of the current Article 95 – which was formerly Article 100a – was not suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why the Court of Justice deems this legal basis to be unsuitable is that it believes that, by means of this legal basis, there is a danger of attempts being made to side-step a specific prohibition in another article of the Treaty – which has also changed number: from Article 129 to Article 152 in the current text – in accordance with which, any harmonisation of national provisions was prohibited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice is therefore trying to prevent any contrivance by means of which this subterfuge could be employed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in this case, this situation does not apply because the proposal for a directive, like the previous directives already in force, intends, in fact, to remove existing barriers to the functioning of the internal market. Therefore, their correct legal basis is the former Article 100a or the current Article 95.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Maaten, has, with good reason, proposed reinforcing that legal basis with a reference to another article, Article 133 on external trade, and furthermore has proposed a series of amendments to some of the articles with the aim of preventing this directive being challenged on the basis of the case-law established by the judgment of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the judgment of the Court of Justice has been guided by too literal an interpretation of the text. This judgment has several questionable aspects but, accepting the judgment as it stands – since we have no choice, given that the court of Justice is the highest body qualified to interpret Community law – there is nothing to prevent this Parliament from declaring itself in favour of the proposed legal basis of Article 95 with Article 133, and introducing the amendments to which I have referred, which include the rapporteur’s amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, on behalf of the Socialist Group, and specifically the Socialist Members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, who voted against this majority opinion to which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has just referred, I must say that we consider that taking this route, rejecting the proposal for a directive, as proposed in two amendments, Amendments Nos 52 and 53, tabled by Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and another 32 MEPs, would lead to a serious restriction on the European Parliament’s legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am not concerned so much at the moment with health issues, which are, of course, important and considerable, as with the constraints that would result from our accepting such a restrictive interpretation of the legislative powers which this European Parliament would have.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that such a restrictive interpretation would practically lead to the elimination of the legislative powers of this institution and of the Council. I do not believe we can take such a restrictive route, that is to say, independently of the content – and the substantial content which has been highlighted by Mr Maaten and others – that there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People’s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying their hands and feet with regard to the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important to the development of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we Socialists support the amendments tabled by Mr Maaten and we reject, of course, Amendments Nos 52 and 53 by the Group of the European People’s Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make three brief comments.</p>
<p class="contents">My first comment concerns the legal basis. The Court has had a judicial review carried out and states quite explicitly that Article 95 can be the legal basis in some cases, provided certain conditions are met, but also states that Article 95 will not be sufficient in certain cases, for example Article 133 would need to be added where the export ban is concerned. In view of the lack of motivation, I therefore support the amendment tabled by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, which calls for us to reject the common position and ask the Commission to submit a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other comments, I would point out that we ought not to concentrate too much on symbols that do not tackle the root cause of the problem. Imposing higher taxes is not a satisfactory way of discouraging people from doing something. Increasing the space for warnings out of all proportion is not a satisfactory way of achieving the desired goal, i.e. better public health. What is more, I feel this will set a poor example if we want to put warnings on other products at a later stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important because we are here and now considering just how credible the European Union’s policy on public health is. I am sorry that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also expressed opinions that the Court ban on tobacco advertising would in some way render this directive null and void. By no means is that true, as this directive concerns the content of cigarettes and not measures to promote tobacco sales. Parliament should no longer be deluded in this matter; it should understand that it is now vital to show support for Mr Maaten’s excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the matter of whether the words ‘light’ or ‘mild’ on brands of tobacco should now be banned. We should keep to our opinion that such misleading descriptions cannot be allowed, and the decision of the Court in October brings nothing new to this matter. We must maintain the stand we took on this before. We must understand that all those countries that have undertaken to draft fairly tough legislation on tobacco have clearly seen deaths from lung cancer and heart and vascular disease brought under control. We should be able to promote all of this in the European Union’s common single market policy as well, which must be based on high standards of protection when it comes to public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strength of this proposal resides in the fact that it is not concerned with the behaviour of individual consumers of tobacco products, but is aimed at making it compulsory for companies to provide all consumers with information, and having the addition of addictive ammonia banned. This would make it less easy for the impression to be created that you can smoke without risking premature death. It would be more difficult to spread reassuring lies.</p>
<p class="contents">The weakness of the proposal resides in the fact that it places heavy emphasis on the promotion of free competition. The imposition of uniform standards in all Member States seems calculated to give the various tobacco companies the same opportunities to earn money throughout the EU. This liberal basic principle does not have my group’s blessing. Our main concern is to protect people against the damage that tobacco products do to their health.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would rather the proposal had taken an all-encompassing approach. Taking public health as the starting point, this would entail a complete ban on advertising and sponsorship and reducing to a minimum the number of young people who take up smoking. We would also need to look at what impact a reduction in the production and consumption of tobacco would have in terms of alternative employment for tobacco farmers and tobacco industry workers, how to put an end to the current EU subsidy regime for tobacco cultivation, and what we need to do to oppose international trade in this unwholesome product. As long as we fail to do this, each and every European measure can be counteracted by increased exports of American tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">All we can adopt at second reading is a watered-down version of the most far-reaching proposals that we voted on six months ago after the first reading. A watered-down text was adopted back then too, but the Council of Ministers still thinks that Parliament’s opinion goes too far.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent those members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left who supported the rapporteur’s proposals at first reading, and who will also support his watered-down proposal at second reading. The proposal is too weak, but without a decision of this kind tobacco products will be able to destroy even more lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy I have been strongly lobbied by various groups about the need to regulate more strictly the sale and presentation of tobacco products in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the amendments which were passed in our committee recently, which sought to increase warnings to the general public about the dangers of smoking. Amendments approved by our committee were to increase the size of the general warnings such as "smoking kills", on the front of cigarette packages from 25 to 30% and to increase the size of additional warnings on cigarette packages from 25 to 40%. Examples of the additional warnings supported by the Committee for inclusion on cigarette packages are: "half of smokers die younger"; "smoking causes fatal lung cancer"; "smoking is highly addictive"; "get help to stop "; and "protect children, do not make them breathe your smoke". Our committee also believes that warning messages should be attached to vending machines.</p>
<p class="contents">Research has shown that the greater the size of the public health warning on cigarette packets, the greater the reduction in the level of cigarette smoking. The results of the research on that matter are so clear that it would be wrong for us, as European Union legislators, not to follow such advice.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send out a strong message about smoking to the 370 million consumers of the European Union and we are going to give our children and smokers all the necessary public warnings about the health dangers of cigarette smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, since the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament has the power of coordination over environmental and consumer protection matters, and it will, of course, work closely with the Council and the Commission in this regard. We regard this procedure as an important legislative weapon of Parliament's arsenal and we intend to use it. I compliment the rapporteur on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I refer to the British-American Tobacco plant in Southampton, which produces all its cigarettes for the non-EU market. With the advent of this directive, the manufacturers will not be able to produce these cigarettes, even though the EU limits do not, of course, apply to their markets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not mean that these cigarettes will not be manufactured. The company concerned, BAT, will transfer production to non-EU countries. So, instead of exporting cigarettes we will be exporting jobs – 4 000 of them in my region alone. Yet, ironically, I do not see in this directive any prohibition on growing tobacco within the Community – even when in countries such as Greece the tobacco grown is so strong that under this directive it would become a criminal offence to use it for manufacturing.</p>
<p class="contents">A Community which subsidises this tobacco-growing and then makes it unlawful to sell it, whilst destroying jobs and the lives of ordinary people who rely on revenue from goods which are not even sold in the Community, cannot gain the respect of ordinary people.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever you think of this directive, please support my amendment tomorrow which takes out the prohibition on manufacturing for non-EU export. This directive will have no health benefits whatsoever outside the EU. It is a classic symptom of political correctness gone mad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the European Court of Justice ruling the Committee then adopted the opinion again, admittedly this time by a large majority. It is true that the Court's ruling did not, in fact, significantly change the legal position, but it did develop it; some aspects have now been clarified and some points are clearer. In fact, it does not actually have anything to do with tobacco: the European Court of Justice's judgment might just as well have been handed down in relation to an advertising ban on alcohol, for example, or an advertising ban on chocolate, because we know that sugar can also be damaging to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the superficial way in which the Commission and the Council of Ministers have examined this Court ruling in their discussions hitherto is shameful. In fact, it would be truer to say that they have not examined it at all; they have completely ignored it, as Commissioner Byrne did just now, and as is also the case, for example, in the statement of reasons for the common position, in which it was not deemed necessary even to correct and make some adjustments to the recitals either. The only laudable exception is Parliament's Legal Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, time does not allow me to go into detail here; that is quite impossible. I can only call on colleagues to go along with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. This is not about the tobacco industry; quite simply it is about upholding the Treaties. Neither is it about legalistic hair-splitting; it is about an eminently political question, which it does not require any legal training to answer. It is simply about respecting areas of competence and safeguarding subsidiarity and also, for example, the rights of colleagues in the national parliaments, who, of course, are entitled to have their own areas of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">This very issue of delimiting competences was addressed in Nice. But if whenever a material majority is found on a specific issue in the three bodies – the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament – this majority is also observed, then we can do without this ceremony and it would suggest that what really matters are institutional safeguards. I hope and assume – and here I am also placing my trust in the European Court of Justice – that it will continue to hold its previous course, that it will agree to step up its efforts to safeguard competences and that, for this reason, it will once again annul the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think there is reason to thank Mr Byrne for a very clear presentation of the legal basis. When I listen to Mrs Palacio and also to Mr Lechner I am reminded most of all of the reports we are receiving from American courts right now. A serious mixture of law and politics, which, in any case, does not increase legal certainty. I believe that reducing the limit values for the tar content and reducing some of the limits for how much nicotine and carbon monoxide cigarettes may contain will have an extremely significant effect on health in Europe. It is important to insist that the Commission draw up a proposal for a common list of additives by the end of 2004 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The secrecy on the part of industry surrounding additives which we have witnessed so far should naturally be brought to an end. I also consider it important that, independently of this common list, a ban is imposed on the use of ammonia and other similar compounds used for the express purpose of making cigarettes more addictive, to increase dependence on cigarettes. This is also something we must put a stop to in an effective way. Finally I would like to make a single comment concerning the matter of exports. I simply do not understand why a majority here in Parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the Member States' own governments – the governments which, however, also represent the many industries referred to. Like Mrs Thyssen, I feel that it is absolutely unethical for us to sell cigarettes outside the area of Europe which, for health reasons, we consider to be unsuitable for use by citizens in our own area. It simply cannot be ethically justifiable to act in this way, and I therefore hope that on this point we arrive at the responsible line which I believe the Council and the Commission have proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than half a million people die needlessly each year in the European Union and the number is set to grow if we do not act now. That is why this directive is so important: bigger, bolder, clearer health warnings, a ban on misleading descriptions such as 'light', 'ultra' and 'mild', a maximum tar content for products used in the EU as well as for exports, and, for the first time, a disclosure of ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">As a relatively new Member of this House it struck me how strong the forces against this directive are in this Parliament. There have been so many red herrings thrown into this debate that I think many people would be more comfortable in a fishing debate than in a public health debate. The power of big tobacco companies is all too evident. I say to each and every one of my colleagues, tobacco is like no other product. You become addicted and it kills you. It is a fact that 80% of people start smoking before the age of eighteen yet the tobacco industry says people make adult choices. It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to stop but there are few policies within the tobacco industry to help those people stop. Instead it pretends to tackle youth smoking. If we had known at the outset what we know about tobacco now, it would be an A-class drug. It is a fact that in the last century almost twice as many people died because of tobacco than in the two world wars put together. If we do not act now, worldwide deaths are estimated at one billion this century.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make sure that the fight to save lives is paramount and play our part in tackling the power of big tobacco interests, which only destroy lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Court of Justice recently handed down its judgment in the case of regulating tobacco advertising to protect human health and it is unambiguous: it is not the task of the Commission and the European Union to regulate these matters, but of the Member States. Only if the internal market is disrupted does the Union have regulatory powers. But the Commission has not submitted one single piece of evidence to show that the internal market is disrupted, not one. Quite the opposite. Where it actually is disrupted, with the different taxation rates and the special rules for Greece, everything is staying as it was. It is therefore ridiculous for people to act here, Commissioner, as though the ruling of the European Court of Justice had not changed anything. This ignorance really is staggering. I predict that this directive, too, will fall before the European Court of Justice, and Parliament and the Commission will make a fool of themselves just as they did the first time, if we are not prepared to examine the legal aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are a Guardian of the Treaties and not someone who can overstep your competences here on your own initiative. If you enlist Article 133 for the export ban then the conclusion is obvious that it is not part of a common commercial policy to dictate to third countries what they should import. This legal basis, too, is completely worthless in my opinion, and that is why the unions, companies and colleagues here are right to refer to job losses. Ten thousand jobs because of the export ban alone, 8 000 of which are in the United Kingdom, are at stake. This does not help anyone to achieve their objectives because production is not reduced, it is just moved. We are seeking to dictate to others how they should live. This is presumptuous and it will not become law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To the shame of this European Union, we require our taxpayers to subsidise the growing of the wretched stuff to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year. At the same time, we jeopardise sensible measures to deter smoking, especially among young people, because we try to put the whole world within our single market. If we insist on telling other countries what health standards they should set by extending our sensible proposals for the domestic market to exports, we shall put all Mr Maaten's good work at risk. Because, as sure as export night follows advertising day, there will be another challenge in the courts, and not just the export provision but the whole directive with it will be thrown out.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like the Commissioner to clarify whether the removal of the exemption for exports applies just to the tar and nicotine levels, as was the impression given in committee, or to all the proposals in the directive. We need to know because thousands of jobs are at stake in Darlington, Nottingham, Southampton and Belfast. Those jobs could be destroyed very quickly by our misunderstanding and our vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see sensible measures go through and not lost. I want to see an end to misleading descriptions such as ‘mild’ and ‘light’ that give the impression that some cigarettes are safer: deeper inhalation means they are not. These labels should go. There should be no exemption for trademarks or we will simply create new anomalies in competition and the single market. I want to see the photographic warning option, sensible listing of ingredients, Europe-wide research, health promotion measures to help children to remain smoke, tar, nicotine and addiction free. I do not want to see all this put at risk because we tried to take this measure beyond the legal powers of this European Union and this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Health organisations are justifiably calling for more protection for public health. Hence, we are all in favour of the directive and of reducing tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields. That is also why we approve of increasing the size of the warnings, in accordance with the common position, and why, as per the common position, we favour short, pithy warnings on cigarette packets and support a ban on the use of misleading words such as ‘mild’, ‘light’, and ‘ultra-light’. Only where these terms are part of registered trademarks which are already marketed could consideration be given to granting derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry complains about the inequality and inefficiency of the present legislation. The inequality concerns the permitted ingredients, for example. We readily support the proposal to produce a list of permitted ingredients.</p>
<p class="contents">The testing procedure is inefficient. As matters stand, each product has to be re-tested in each country. We are in favour of devising a standardised testing method recognised by all EU Member States, to be implemented by an approved testing laboratory. We would also like a test of this kind, carried out in a laboratory recognised by a Member State, to be valid in all EU Member States, as is customary in the field of medicine, so as to cut down on the number of tests performed on animals, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask that special consideration be given to the position of SMEs. This is hit disproportionately hard by the directive in some cases, specifically by Article 6(1). We will therefore vote in favour of the amendment that does request information on the ingredients used, but which proposes a more realistic working method than is outlined at present in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the following to say about the legal basis. The directive builds on three existing directives on the same subject which have the same legal basis. These have never caused problems with regard to the legal basis hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal services of the EU institutions do not foresee any problems in this area. We will certainly assume the legal basis to be valid once Article 133 has been added. Naturally, we want to follow correct legal procedures and it would, of course, be regrettable if the Court were ultimately to reject the position of our legal services, but we cannot afford to discard the directive because then we would have nothing, all the work would have been for nothing and we might as well start all over again with the same old work and the same texts. As far as Parliament is concerned, the important thing now is to show political courage and produce a directive which improves the functioning of the internal market and provides maximum protection in the field of public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like to thank the Commissioner for his comments on the legal basis. For brevity’s sake, I would like to echo what Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Lund had to say on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have two additional comments to make. The first concerns Article 11. The reports produced by this committee are crucial in terms of future policy. I am also delighted that this Commissioner is responsible for it. I do have my concerns as to whether the Commission has the capacity to work on this report. I am hoping the Commissioner might reassure us that an increase in the level of staff support within the Commission is on the cards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, major alterations must be made to the Council’s common position. It is important in terms of the legal basis, more far-reaching harmonisation of the market, better consumer protection and so on. Each of these elements in isolation probably lacks sufficient support here in Parliament for a qualified majority to be achieved. But as a package, it should lead to better balanced and more results-orientated legislation. There was also a readiness to compromise within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I have in mind Mrs Martens and Mr Sacconi and our cooperation with them. I therefore urge you to support this compromise package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by relating a little of the history of how this directive came before Parliament. This directive was introduced to take account of the European Parliament's Valverde López report of 1997 which mentioned many of the elements of the present text and called for a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reading debate on this proposal marks very swift progress. It shows the urgency with which the Council of Ministers and Parliament have both dealt with this matter. I should also like to stress the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, to advance with this file in a balanced and conscientious way.</p>
<p class="contents">The health effects of tobacco use are now widely recognised and there is a shared feeling among legislators and the public alike that the time has come to adopt stringent rules and regulations on this product. The proposal contains some significant improvements on the present legal situation and aims to create harmonised rules on a series of product regulation issues. On others, the groundwork has been put in place to gather the elements needed for subsequent initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the principal improvements concerns a new lower tar ceiling and, for the first time, a carbon monoxide and nicotine ceiling in cigarettes. Controversially, these ceilings would cover all products manufactured in the Union, whether for domestic consumption or not. The arguments which have been presented about possible job losses have been carefully weighed against the certainty that if we act otherwise we would be exporting a product not considered good enough for Community citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I might also mention that the figures put forward for potential job losses were already an issue when the original directives now being recast were proposed over ten years ago. The job losses then forecast never occurred. In fact, the main job reductions in this industry are due to increased investment in automation, as the firms themselves have declared. The Commission would nevertheless see an argument for an extended transitional period for the application of the rules for exported products, in order to allow more time for manufacturing formulae to be changed and new marketing approaches to be undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis asked whether the exemption would apply. The exemption would apply to Article 3, as I understand the amendment, i.e. tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of descriptors, I would stress that the effect of the use of certain terms such as ‘light’, ‘low-tar’ and ‘mild’ can be very misleading. People change from one type of cigarette to another under the false assumption that the ‘light’ cigarette is safer for their health. This is also a factor in why people continue to smoke instead of trying to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the need to regulate in the interests of consumers is clear. Indeed, in the negotiations presently under way for a World Health Organisation framework convention on public health, the same provisions are currently proposed. Consequently, the Community rules will fit well into the future international arrangements, avoiding the danger of trade barriers and reinforcing, at the same time, the protection of consumers and ensuring a high level of health.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that the European Court of Justice has stated in its judgment on Case 376/98 that public health provides a legal basis in addition to and in association with its Article 95. In fact, I would draw your attention to the judgment of the Court. I am not fully convinced that everybody here who has pronounced on the issue has read a copy of the judgment. I would recommend it to those who have not.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, Paragraph 88 of the judgment further states: "Furthermore, provided that the conditions for recourse to Article 100a [that is now 95] and 66 as a legal basis are fulfilled, the Community legislature cannot be prevented from relying on that legal basis on the ground that public health protection is a decisive factor in the choices to be made. On the contrary, the third paragraph of Article 129(1) provides that health requirements are to form a constituent part of the Community's other policies, and Article 100a(3) expressly requires that, in the process of harmonisation, a high level of human health protection is to be ensured."</p>
<p class="contents">I also refer you to Paragraph 98 of the judgment. Let me read that in the context of the challenge made to me as to whether there is a substantial legal basis or not. "In principle, therefore, a directive prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in periodicals, magazines and newspapers could be adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty with a view to ensuring the free movement of press products, on the lines of Directive 89/552, Article 13 of which prohibits television advertising of tobacco products in order to promote the free broadcasting of television programmes."</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear from the judgment that the judges took the view that Article 95 could be used as a legal basis for regulating the internal market. In fact, in coming to their conclusion as to what was the appropriate judgment in this particular case, they took the view that some aspects of regulating the market in tobacco and advertising could be permitted and some not. They went on to say in Paragraph 117 of the judgment: "As has been observed in Paragraphs 98 and 111 of this judgment, a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products could have been adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty. However, given the general nature of the prohibition of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products laid down by the directive, partial annulment of the directive would entail amendment by the Court of provisions of the directive. Such amendments are a matter for the Community legislature. It is not therefore possible for the Court to annul the directive partially."</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very important paragraph in the judgment of the Court. It clearly indicates that the decision taken by the Court was such that it said: some of this is permissible, some of it is not. Given the general nature of the directive, we cannot sever one from the other and, therefore, we have to strike it all down. There is a clear signpost here as to how we can move forward on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the question on exports that Mr Bowis asked me earlier, it is quite clear that, in the unlikely event that the aspect of the directive that refers to exports is challenged and if the view of the Court – which I do not predict – is that it is not supported by the legal basis, it is clearly severable from the directive. Therefore, even in those circumstances, the directive would survive.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, let me point out that, from the point of view of international and Community rules, there is no exception for registered trade marks in measures taken for public-health protection, particularly here, where the effects on smokers' behaviour are so dramatic.</p>
<p class="contents">On ammonia, let me say that the Commission considers a ban to be very premature and cannot find a scientific argument for such an approach at this stage. It would be preferable to wait until the overall question of additives is dealt with in the first Commission report. However, it is also clear that concern on this question is fuelled by internal company information released through court proceedings. It would not be prudent to ignore this data. That is why the Commission proposes to deal with the ammonia issue in a measured way, after seeking scientific advice and having considered all the available information. It will, in particular, report on the alleged use of additives to increase the addictive nature of tobacco products.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of additives in general, the Commission is ready and willing to give priority attention to this issue on the basis of the information it receives from manufacturers and importers. This was said in the declaration made when the common position was adopted. To do so before we have the necessary data would be speculative and premature. We need to have sufficient time to analyse this information and to consult expert opinion. In addition, the Commission wishes to preserve its right of initiative under the Treaty in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the size of the warning labels, I am sure that a satisfactory compromise can be achieved, based perhaps on the Commission's amended proposal of June, which already went towards the amendments made at first reading. The use of coloured photos to accompany texts is perhaps premature and not fully evaluated at this stage. The Commission would prefer to examine the available data and report back in due course. The creation of a maximum-sized warning label for some large packs would be a proportionate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Davies said in relation to the coloured photographs that Member States might be given permission to have this form of advertising on the packet. I do not agree with that view for two reasons: firstly, this would run counter to the concept of harmonisation, which is the justification for using Article 95 as the basis; secondly, even if Member States wanted to advertise in this way, it does not require any sanction or authorisation by legislation at EU level to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of vending machines falls outside the scope of this text but the Commission would be willing to examine it in another context to see what approaches would be possible. This is linked to the question of access to products, in particular where machines are situated in unsupervised areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On the amendment dealing with GMOs, the Commission considers that this would be better dealt with as an additional recital rather than mentioning it in an article by itself.</p>
<p class="contents">On laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with approval of tests is superfluous as another article provides for circulation of goods that are in accordance with the provisions of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to make provision for results of tests to be controlled where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards frequency of notifications by industry, it seems clear that annual notifications are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the common agricultural policy, this is not an issue touched on by this text and to mention it in the recitals would not be legally sound. In any case, a full review of the common agricultural policy on tobacco is scheduled for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">On taxation, I quite agree that the price of tobacco products, and by extension the issue of tobacco taxes, is a key issue in reducing the attraction of tobacco for the young. However, this aspect is not the subject of the present directive. We have to be careful not to introduce elements which are not covered by the internal market or common commercial policy legal basis. The Commission reports on the application of the excise directives address this problem in the proper way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a total of 54 amendments have been tabled in the report and of these I am pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept 33, either totally or partially. It cannot, however, accept the following amendments: Nos 6, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 25, 28, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45, 46, 47, 49, 52, 53 and 54. Thus, the amendments that the Commission has accepted will make this a much improved text and take account of the main concerns expressed by Members.</p>
