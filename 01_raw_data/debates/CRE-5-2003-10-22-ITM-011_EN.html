This initiative follows on from the Green Paper on compensation to crime victims with which, in September 2001, the Commission began to promote the debate on this issue and which, a year ago, was the subject of a report, which I had the honour of drafting, and also a Parliament resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions during debates in this House on the issue of justice and combating crime, a judicial system emerged at European level that centres almost exclusively – and I would say quite rightly – on penalties, punishment and control. Only to a lesser extent<span class="bold"> </span>does this system deal with the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the defendants and, more generally, with a crime prevention policy. At the bottom of this list are, I am sorry to say, the victims of crime: innocent citizens who, despite having suffered an injury, at times serious, are, all too often, denied adequate protection and compensation. Thus, we need to put the protection of victims at the centre of the debate on justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The most urgent problem to solve is the existence of major disparities between the national compensation schemes, enormous differences as regards the level of compensation and related procedures in each individual Member State. Such a situation cannot be considered compatible with the principles underlying the creation of a single area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a great deal of progress during the course of the year. The European Union has selected possible objectives to pursue, criticised the difficulties associated with the various legal systems of the Member States, identified the different kinds of needs of crime victims and established the minimum Community measures to be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The most eagerly-awaited and most important step forward is, however, the desire now to adopt a binding legislative strategy, at Community level, to actively realise the Tampere policy objectives. Thanks to this directive, it will be possible to take an initial step towards harmonisation of the European criminal law systems as regards the treatment of crime victims, guaranteeing them, with all due respect for the principle of subsidiarity, sufficient attention, recognition of the necessary support and reparation for the harm inflicted, including when the person who committed the crime has not been identified, has disappeared or is unable to pay. Identifying common categories to define crime victims, compensation beneficiaries when the victim has died and the common procedures and formalities for payment therefore constitute the minimum legal base that the European Union is called upon to have to provide, so that it is no longer the case that the amount of compensation or the possibility of receiving it depends on the place of residence or on the place where the crime was committed. To this end, although I generally agree with everything that the Commission proposed, we added a more explicit description of the type of damage for which compensation is to be provided and the time frames laid down for compensation than is contained in the original text.</p>
<p class="contents">We specified a minimum threshold for exclusion from compensation; we proposed, in order to avoid linguistic difficulties, to introduce harmonised forms and translations, where appropriate, into the language that the victim can understand. The priority objective is to guarantee the fundamental principle of non-discrimination for all citizens and legal residents in the Union and the desire to limit, as far as possible, the effects and suffering of victims of unjust damage, who are victims a second time when they are denied support by inadequate, or sometimes non-existent compensation systems</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude Mr President by thanking my fellow Members who contributed to the good outcome of the work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These aims are:</p>
<p class="contents">to create a minimum standard for compensation to all citizens and legal residents of the European Union who are victims of crime, and to improve access to compensation in cross-border situations. There is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that these two aims are all the more valuable since 2 of the 15 current Member States, and most of the states which are about to accede to the European Union, still have no compensation system in place. They are all the more valuable because there is currently no system of cross-border cooperation to assist victims in claiming compensation. The proposal’s first aim is to ensure that the opportunity of obtaining state compensation exists in every Member State. The aim, however, is not to harmonise the relevant legislation in the Member States. It is simply to establish a minimum standard which each Member State can exceed if it so desires, thereby respecting the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Victims of terrorism, in particular, fall within the scope of this directive. Close relatives and dependents of victims also have a right to compensation if the victim dies as a result of injuries sustained and caused by a crime falling within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">All pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses incurred as a direct result of injuries sustained will be compensated. Compensation for non-pecuniary losses does not currently exist in many Member States, and is particularly important for the Commission, especially in serious crimes such as armed robbery, rape, sexual offences or terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal’s second aim is to facilitate access to compensation for crime victims in cross-border situations. When an individual is a victim of crime in a country other than that in which they reside, it is unlikely that the victim will have much time to set in motion the appropriate criminal and civil procedures, beyond reporting the criminal act. We feel, therefore, that the system should allow the victim to set these procedures in motion easily, from his or her country of residence. The directive, therefore, proposes a system of cooperation between the authorities of the Member States. The Commission is proposing that a manual be established and made available to the authorities. It shall contain the basic criteria applying to compensation in each Member State, the territorial jurisdiction of the authorities in each Member State, if applicable, and the application forms used in each Member State for this purpose. The manual thus established shall be available in all of the official languages of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This freedom of movement can only be exercised, however, if the Union also adopts all measures necessary to protect its citizens, especially if they fall victim to a crime, irrespective of their nationality within the EU and also irrespective of the Member State where they fall victim to a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the European Union like travelling, and they do a great deal of it, working in other Member States and also exercising their right to freedom of movement in the EU in a variety of other ways. Yet any citizen can fall victim to a crime or a terrorist attack in another Member State, or indeed in their own country. Until now, national legislation has varied widely, as Mrs Angelilli has explained. In other words, two persons who have been victims of a crime in very similar circumstances but in two different Member States may receive wildly varying compensation for similar damage, and in an extreme scenario, a victim may receive no compensation at all. That is why, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I greatly welcome the Commission’s proposal and thank Mrs Angelilli for her report, which is intended to establish rules for victims of intentional criminal acts or terrorist attacks within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of this directive, all EU citizens and all persons who are legally resident in the EU will receive appropriate compensation if they fall victim to a crime. This also means that anyone who is the victim of a crime within the EU will have the right to approach an authority in their own Member State in order to seek assistance. This ensures that victims have easier access to compensation, even if the crime was committed outside the person’s own Member State. It ensures that victims of crime will at last enjoy appropriate protection and compensation, which, paradoxically, is still not given due consideration in many jurisdictions and systems of criminal law to the present day. I am convinced that there will be a substantial majority in favour of this report in the House tomorrow, and I am gratified that this is the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The high degree of consensus achieved in the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is undoubtedly essential in such an important area as the one we are debating today; compensation for the victims of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The judicial systems of the Member States of the European Union do not pay enough attention to the victims of crime, and what is more, they often do not provide them with appropriate protection or compensation. As a result of this situation, in recent years criminologists and people responsible for judicial policy have paid particular attention to the situation of the victims of crime, within the context of criminal violations, and the protection of their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the report we approved in November 2000, on the status of the victim in the judicial process, was the first step in this legislature towards resolving this problem. It was an important step towards filling the immense legal vacuum which represented, in my opinion, a form of discrimination against the millions of citizens who move freely about the European Union, at risk of being victims of crime, but who are faced with 15 judicial borders, which, in practice, have shown themselves to be incapable of protecting their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that today we are closer to being able to guarantee compensation to victims, not only in order to alleviate the damage and suffering they experience as much as possible, but also in order to pacify the social conflict resulting from crime and to facilitate the application of a rational and correct judicial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, although reparations or compensation should fall to the person who has committed the crime, as the person directly responsible for the damage, in practice, full compensation by the perpetrator of the crime is rarely achieved, either because they have not been identified, or because they have disappeared or are insolvent.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have indicated in the amendments approved, it is necessary to restrict the unjust effects resulting from the current varying levels of compensation in the Member States and to guarantee that the citizens of the European Union receive suitable compensation for the damage suffered when they are victims of crime in any part of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This support for the victim must involve two types of measures which complement each other. Firstly, material, psychological, health and social assistance and, secondly, compensation for the damaged caused, both material and emotional, to the victim or the persons dependent on them. There is no doubt that this would represent great progress, with a view to achieving the political objectives which the European Union set for itself at the Tampere Summit and in the Vienna Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice and the exercise of the right to free movement will not be possible unless the Union adopts the necessary measures to protect the citizen when they are victims of crime in any part of its territory, regardless of their nationality, and unless they are compensated for the damage suffered. This initiative by the European Commission and the work of Commissioner Vitorino is, in my view, the right way to achieve that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have on the table a measure geared towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice – a measure which attempts to respond to the day-to-day concerns of citizens. This is the great aim we have set ourselves and through which all citizens must see their integrity protected, have access to justice and see their rights ensured, regardless of where they are, and as easily as if they were in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to set minimum standards for state compensation, as well as better access to such compensation in cross-border situations, thereby also establishing a last-resort guarantee for victims who are unable to gain access to compensation from the offender or by other means. We know very well that victims are often not successful in obtaining full compensation from offenders, either because the latter do not have sufficient funds, or because they have disappeared or never been identified. We want to prevent the substantial differences between the various Member States from causing unjustifiable variations in the compensation to which citizens are entitled, simply as a result of their having been victims of crime in one part of the European Union rather than another. That would be incomprehensible, especially in view of the existence of a common area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this proposal for a directive, therefore, as well as Mrs Angelilli’s report. This proposal aims not to harmonise but to introduce minimum standards, enabling those Member States which so wish to maintain or introduce provisions that are more favourable to victims of such tragedies. In the first place, the principle of territoriality should apply, so that the Member State where the crime was committed is responsible for paying compensation. At the same time, the victim should have the right to submit his or her application for compensation to an authority in his or her Member State of residence, with a view to avoiding secondary victimisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that the principles of social justice should be respected, and each Member State should be called upon to provide compensation not just to its own citizens, but also to other victims of violence carried out within its borders, such as migrant workers, students, tourists and others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I believe it is true to say that there is little that matters to citizens as much as feeling safe and secure in the country in which they live or reside. There is no point at all in us promoting the free movement of workers across the European Union if our citizens do not feel that they will be protected from crime in whatever state they may find themselves. If EU citizens are to believe in the European Union – and let us face it, some of them do not at the moment – it is essential that they are confident of receiving the same standard of protection from crime and the same treatment as victims of crime as they would expect if they were in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, this legislation seeks not just to help anyone who might be unfortunate enough to be a victim of such a crime, but to try to ensure that there is consistency. To be a victim of a crime is bad enough, but the problems of personal and emotional torture will continue if they do not get fair and appropriate compensation. This is all the more important when we know that the legal systems vary from one country to another, and the ways and workings of the different police forces and the actions they take are not the same from one country to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud this proposal. I believe it will provide a central body in citizens' own Member States, which would apply to the country where the crime occurred to get compensation on their behalf. We should not forget that violent crime can take place anywhere, in any country. It is right and proper that we do everything to level out the system to make certain it works in favour of the citizen and the victim of the crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome Mrs Angelilli’s draft amendments and agree with the underlying thinking. With regard to these amendments, I would just like to draw attention to the fact that, to my mind, Parliament should preserve the essence of an initiative such as this, based on common minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I too would like to be more ambitious, but I would draw the House’s attention to the fact that excessive ambition might render this initiative difficult to approve, whereas I would like to see it approved in the shortest possible order. For this reason, in order not to delay matters any further, the Commission will not table an amended proposal but will opt for the compromise of fighting to put forward the intention underpinning the overwhelming majority of Mrs Angelilli’s draft amendments, 53 out of a total of 77, in its negotiations with the Council on adopting this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
