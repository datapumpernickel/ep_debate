They were referring to the part of the Commission budget for development cooperation that is devoted to primary education. Currently, that is only 4%, and it must therefore be doubled to 8%, hence the famous ‘double now’ slogan. Education is an important means, if not the most important means, of combating poverty. Literacy breaks the vicious poverty circle in which many families have been imprisoned for generations. If countries are to develop further, they need an educated population. Education is also the key to improving the position of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Across the world, 113 million children are still not receiving any education, and approximately two-thirds of these are girls. In 2000, the international community in North and South agreed that, by 2015, all children should be able to attend school. If that Millennium Development Goal, education for all, is to be achieved, we need more funds between us: an estimated EUR 8 billion extra to be able to educate every child by 2015. Incidentally, that is the same amount in total over the next few years as the war in Iraq cost in three weeks. Primarily, of course, developing countries themselves have to make approximately 20% of their budgets available for basic social services such as education and health care. The North must commit itself to the aim of together having produced additional resources for education by 2015. Some countries have to increase their total contribution, whilst others, within theirs, have to move funds over to education. Without that commitment on the part of North and South, all our combined efforts at effective poverty reduction have little chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the European Union has a special responsibility in the field of education. The Commission and the Member States together constitute the world’s largest donors active in development cooperation. Therefore, they have to – and do – take the lead in policies aimed at sustainability and long-term solutions. Europe’s share of the figure of EUR 8 billion per year mentioned earlier is available. Much of it is lying dormant within the European budget, or can be released by the movement of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows, the Parliament is no advocate of granting budget support just like that, because money intended for education, for example, is then often used for completely different purposes, as we saw from the recent example of money being spent on defence in Uganda. Instead we advocate sectoral support, whereby not only the Finance Ministers are involved but, in this case, also the Ministers for Education. In addition, my report advocates an active role for teaching unions and parental organisations in the development of education plans in the developing country. After all, it is not we who develop a country; it develops itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to our questions yesterday, Commissioner Nielson said that the Commission has, to date, made EUR 1.3 billion available for the next five years. That is a significant and important start. I also understood from his answers that the Commission is in the process of systematically looking into where, within the dormant funds, further possibilities lie for achieving a considerable increase. In addition to the funds within the ninth European Development Fund that are to be devoted to education, still more is needed if all the education targets are really to be achieved. Progress is too slow; we need to speed it up considerably. Priority must be given to doubling the budget for primary education, and, as part of this, it is equally important that the Commission’s Education for All Fast Track Initiative should play a leading role. The Fast Track Initiative is an initiative of Unesco, the World Bank and various donors, including the Commission. Developing countries – Mauritania and Niger, to name but two – receive accelerated, supplementary funding on the basis of education proposals. My report urges the Commission to convert its pledges into tangible financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I am enormously pleased that my report can already be regarded as outdated on that point on account of the Commission’s pledge to finance the first seven countries. I appreciate that very much. It is a success for us all. Unfortunately, on many other points my report is very current, and by no means outdated. There remains to be addressed the important issue of girls, who still constitute the majority of the 113 million children not receiving any education. Many children still cannot attend school because they are working, whether voluntarily or against their will. Education is still not provided free of charge in many cases, which means that many parents cannot afford to send their children to school. In addition, education in developing countries has to contend with the loss of teachers due to AIDS, with an absence of, or too little, reading material, and with schools that are difficult to reach. In the post-conflict situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, education remains imperative, precisely because these are situations in which reconstruction is to be achieved from devastation and a heap of rubble.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately there is a fair amount of good news, too. Benin and Gambia recently abolished school fees for girls, and Eritrea, for years ravaged by war, was recently awarded the International Literacy Prize. My report asks the Commission to report back in a year’s time on the implementation of this resolution, if it is adopted tomorrow, and I am assuming with some confidence that it will be. I hope that that progress report will be full of good news, and I consider it a tremendous stroke of luck for those sympathetic to the cause of education that the Commission has been prepared to make that EUR 1.3 billion available.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that last week it was 200 children in Brussels, this week it is in excess of 10 000 cards and petitions from Europeans sent to the Commission Representations in support both of my report and of the Commissioner. It is good that the public is aware of what we are doing here and that we are all proud of the work the European Union does.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Double now’: that was the slogan, and I shall keep saying it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I would like to thank Parliament, and Mr Van den Berg in particular, for the extensive work and interest put into the examination of the Commission’s communication on education and training.</p>
<p class="contents">Education has a major impact on reducing poverty and our purpose is to maximise it. This is in line with the Millennium Development Goals and Education for All objectives. Ownership by our partner countries and complementarity with other donors are also vital aspects. In fact, when we talk about this, not only focusing on the actions of the Commission, we should take a tour around Europe and clarify what each of our Member States is doing, because complementarity is supposed to work both ways. Even in Maastricht this is a common activity and not a Commission-only activity. Of course it is a privilege for the Commission to have an organised dialogue with Parliament on all occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We support education both through budgetary support and sector funding. I would agree with Mr Van den Berg about the special quality of sector programme funding but we are, in the name of complementarity, very happy that the Commission can provide budget support. Where we do it we try to link it to policies that have also been worked out and contributed to by other donors, thus improving the quality of the recipient or partner country's actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication on this subject also opens up the possibility for the Commission to fund recurrent expenditure in education budgets of partner countries. This has been a missing element. It is nice to build a teacher training college, but if we only build the bricks, and not the curriculum and especially the professors' salaries, we will never meet the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must make sure that resources reach those who truly need them and create results.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partner countries have to improve the efficiency and quality of their education systems and, as regards donors, a flexible attitude toward financing mechanisms is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority in our education policy is basic education - six-year primary school. This is in line with the Millennium Development Goals on education, which give priority to universal primary education.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is to ensure a balanced strategy encompassing secondary and higher education, vocational training and adult literacy. Work-related training is of particular importance in countries that have attained an acceptable level of schooling as a first step. We also included additional policy priorities for our support for education.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, more attention should be given to the impact of HIV/Aids on education systems and the role of education in preventing HIV/Aids and in improving health in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Community policy focuses on the needs of the poorest countries and poorest people, with particular attention to women, orphans and children in conflict and post-conflict areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication highlights that resources for education and training must be substantially increased, so the slogan about doubling the effort is very meaningful. The international community should give preference to countries that have the most clear-cut commitments to Education for All. This is the important outcome of the whole effort in Education for All, not only highlighting it but also creating some sort of peer pressure on all concerned to give this higher priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Education budgets should be geared towards vulnerable populations and equity in access to education: primary education should be compulsory and free, girls and boys should have the same opportunities, rural areas should be given priority, indigenous populations should be supported and the special educational needs of orphans or disabled should be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission highlights the importance of a shift in the monitoring of education, focusing more on outcomes and results. Clear indicators are being developed using and reinforcing our partner countries’ own monitoring systems in close coordination with other donors. This is an issue we have been discussing in our dialogue between the Commission and Parliament. We have seen some real progress in improving these monitoring systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We work with other donors to agree on common, but country-specific indicators. It is not possible, or desirable, to evaluate the impact of a single donor’s activity in isolation from the country’s activity and other donors’ operations. In the coming years we will be able to have a better-founded discussion because we will have figures available in order to clarify our position.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see a place for a mix of input and output targets, but we do not support a specific target as a percentage for the education sector. This is in respect of the reality of ownership. There is no disagreement about the wish for increasing it, but we cannot give a specific figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur for this resolution and the strong commitment to promoting education it always demonstrates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If there were only 100 people living on this earth, 15 would be illiterate. While societies enter into the information and knowledge society and modern technologies develop and spread at rapid speed, 860 million adults are illiterate. Over 100 million children have no access to school and countless children, youths and adults who attend school or other education programmes fall short of the required level to be considered literate in today's complex world and society.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main effects of low or no income is lack of education, insufficient schooling or, worse, lack of access to school education, which is one of the single most limiting factors in life. The poor have no access at all to training. Those deprived of an education or skills and vocational training have difficulty in finding work or developing their business talents. Poverty prevents both children and adults from going to school. Modern technology is not open to all on an equal footing, so the gap between rich and poor is widening.</p>
<p class="contents">Poor people in far-flung rural areas often find it hard, if not impossible, to attend school because it is just too far for them to go. Insufficient education also prevents lots of people from knowing their rights or the benefits to which they are entitled. It makes it more difficult to handle any kind of relationship with local or national administrations, to obtain loans from a credit institution or to resist all sorts of abuses. Insufficient education also makes it more difficult to analyse information given by the media and political rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall Community programmes are still not sufficiently focused on reducing poverty. The proportion of Community aid spent in low-income countries has fallen from 70% in 1990 to 38% now. There are also too many programmes. What is needed is a radical simplification of development programmes. The unhealthy focus on geopolitical regions should be ended and a global approach to poverty reduction should be central.

He has shown flexibility by accepting the majority of the amendments tabled, and, on behalf of my parliamentary group, I would like to say that we shall vote for the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, many fora and macroconferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face. It is something of a coincidence that, with the resources now available, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives set for 2015. It is good, however, that, within our limited means, we are focusing our attention on health and education, which are so closely linked and interdependent.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clearly shown that health and education, education and health, are the best policies for development, that they enable millions of human beings to escape poverty. It is true that some progress is being made, as stated by the rapporteur. In Africa, for example, 60% of children today attend school, which means that 40% are still not attending. In other words, 45 million children are condemned to illiteracy and poverty, probably for life.</p>
<p class="contents">New difficulties have arisen in some countries. The tragedy of child soldiers means that, in some West African countries, mothers prevent their sons from attending school for fear that they will be kidnapped and not return home, as we have seen recently, last week, in Ivory Coast, in a report by various agencies and other NGOs present on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of gender segregation are still causing an unsustainable situation in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries. In Latin America investment in education has dropped alarmingly over the past few years of crisis throughout the region, and this affects ethnic minorities in particular, as the Commissioner has pointed out today, in Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, but also in countries such as Argentina, which until now had an excellent education system but is now moving backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">By attending school, both boys and girls can and should receive a basic education that contributes to improving health, not just in relation to HIV and the ways in which it is transmitted – as the rapporteur reminds us – which, although it is a serious problem, is no more serious than other problems that could be alleviated more cheaply. This is the case of food hygiene, to cite just one example.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is particularly necessary for international financial organisations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to review their criteria and make them more flexible in order to promote free, universal education. That is now one of the priorities we must address and try to achieve some progress in this specific area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor would we in this Chamber seek to deal with this issue in a purist way: we recognise the links between education and other development goals; that the fight against HIV/AIDS is crucial, given the 1000 teachers per year in Mozambique who die from that disease; the trade liberalisation issues <span class="bold">–</span> regularly discussed in this Chamber <span class="bold">–</span> which lead directly to lost revenue to developing country governments, and cutbacks in education. These are all complex and interrelated issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commissioner will not be surprised that we continue tonight the debate about the budget we have had with him for four years. There is a need to move more consistently in the budget to ensure that Commission support goes to the education sector. There is just 3% in terms of education as a focal sector in the 7th and 8th EDF Funds. I acknowledge what he said tonight, supporting our call for a doubling of funds. We thank him for what he said, but the test for all of us will be delivering that in the ACP countries and elsewhere through the mid-term review and continuing the good beginning he has made in terms of re-allocating non-disbursed expenditure to support the fast-track initiative, as my friend and colleague, Mr Van den Berg, has said.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, macroeconomic support is important. I know he will be thinking that. We should support initiatives like those promoted by UNESCO in its Education for All Global Monitoring Report that ensures the budgetary support of all international donors goes to the education sector. As my colleague just said, we should soberly recognise that on current trends the UN Millennium Development Goal of getting all children into basic education by 2015 - the most achievable and affordable of all those development goals - is going to fall short by 70 countries. We have to take our own responsibility in the European Union for putting that right and that means, in the Commission's annual report, year-by-year measuring of how EU Commission support is trying to turn that situation around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So what is the situation? We have a good report, we have a good rapporteur, we have a highly-motivated Commissioner here among us, and many committed people in the field, overseas aid workers, and educationalists. Yet there are a number of infuriating aspects, because everything takes so long. The clock is ticking and yet I see so many organisations in the field that have to beg in order to be able to build schools and pay teachers. We have a long road ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to education and access to education are often empty words in developing countries. That is right: there are still 113 million children who do not attend school and most of them are girls, as Mr van den Berg has already said. They have to help with the housework, they have to contribute to the daily provision of food for the whole family, they have to look after the infants, they have to sell any leftovers at market and they have to fetch drinking water. That means that they have no time to devote to themselves. I can therefore wholeheartedly endorse the conclusions of this report, namely that education is the key to combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Only through education can a country develop, only through an adequately educated population can a country progress. Give a girl or a woman education and you are educating the whole family. We also all know that equal opportunities for women are not only achieved by changing legislation and social conditions. No! It happens through education. Participation of women in all sectors of society and the achievement of general social, cultural and economic progress begin with reasonable qualitative and quantitative education. We have already seen this in Europe. Only when women were given reasonable schooling and access to education did emancipation take off in all sectors of society, including politics. But it is a long road.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur rightly says in the notes to his report, educated women have more opportunities for improving the economic situation of themselves and their family, and even down to their choice of husband. The individual personal development of women also offers more protection against exploitation in all its forms, including prostitution, forced or otherwise, and human trafficking, particularly trafficking in women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, despite this, three further observations. The time frame indicated in this report is in my view somewhat unclear. The financial consequences are not properly set out. And I therefore hope that the Commission, jointly with the Member States, will set to work in a coordinated way to achieve the objectives contained in the statement of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly the problem of AIDS, and finally, in conclusion, education, which as Commissioner Nielson said at the outset, must be adapted to the local culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Development and Cooperation and our rapporteur, Mr van den Berg, therefore deserve thanks for a report that demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the subject and genuine concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it appears that the 2015 target for universal primary education remains a long way off. That is the single factor which is significantly undermining all the other work that is being done in the world to reduce poverty. The financing needed is EUR 8 billion per year. It is a lot, but not impossible, in order that everyone’s right to education, as stated in the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights more than 50 years ago, might come about.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur quite rightly mentions that the Commission must participate in the World Bank’s ‘Education for all <span class="bold">–</span> Fast track’ programme. Likewise, he warns the EU, and with good reason, not to agree to schooling being included as a service in the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade and Services. Primary education must be regarded as being independent of free-market rules and productivity criteria. We must trust in the notion that raising standards of education and the literacy rate is the best thing global trade can hope for. That is why the G8 countries must also be reminded of their promise to finance the Fast Track Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">My own experience of cooperation development work reinforces my conviction that it is especially necessary to invest in girls’ education. That is the key to development. That way we can combat excessive population growth, as an educated woman will have fewer children. Women’s education is also a way out of the vicious circle, where, for example, many Asian women and girls find themselves: in mortal danger from the womb to the grave, with discrimination starting even before birth and continuing all their life. Where a girl is a liability and a burden on the family only a determined shift in attitudes and the commencement of education opportunities will ensure there is any change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is set out in this report, the proportion of people who are illiterate is depressingly high in many countries, particularly in Africa, where there are few opportunities, especially in sparsely-populated areas. As it would, in desert or other uninhabited areas, be unrealistic to build a large number of schools near to where people live, we have to take a good look at other solutions to reduce the educational deficit. This is one of the things Mr van den Berg takes up in his report, proposing, for example, the setting-up of mobile schools, which are of particular importance in providing basic education.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context too, though, I will come back to the subject of modern information and communication technologies, the use of which enables distances to be overcome, the digital gap to be crossed, and education to become more widespread. It is certain, though, that in the long term, the most important mass medium is radio, which could – and should – be even more widely used as a means of providing education than it has been so far. The example of what is done in the Australian outback can certainly not be followed exactly in African countries, but is one from which one can learn, and it too must form part of any strategy for education.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that I do not have to point out the need to take especial account of girls and women in all educational endeavours. In this report, at any rate, this has become a generally accepted fact. It is not, however, generally known that education – particularly basic education – conducted in the predominant regional languages results in a marked increase in the desire for education and reduces parents’ misgivings about sending their children to school. This is where we must help with the investment in appropriate teaching material, play our part in promoting the education of teachers and contributing to the dissemination of knowledge that relates to local interests and is therefore an indispensable necessity in terms of raising the consciousness of civil society.</p>

<p class="contents">This is not the first time Parliament has addressed this matter and I do not think it will be the last, and not only because for many of us – and for me, of course – achieving obligatory, free, high-quality universal education for all is the absolute priority of development cooperation. I said that we will continue to talk about it because we are far from being able to achieve the objectives set in Dakar within the anticipated timescale, and we must therefore continue to be vigilant so that there are no further delays and, if possible, to ensure that at least the European Union and the Member States turn the commitments they have made into reality, into practical action, and that they decide not just to give the appearance of making education the priority in development, but really make it a priority, if we genuinely want a fairer society, in which each individual has the same choices and opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In a moment we shall discuss the report for which I am rapporteur, on capacity-building and its key role in improving the effectiveness of development aid. How, though, can we think of capacity-building if 113 million children have never been to school and 150 million have not completed primary education, as the rapporteur points out in his report? For this reason, I can but agree with the measures proposed to give education its rightful place in development cooperation policy and overcome the obstacles that prevent so many boys and girls from having access to education and, with it, the right to a better life.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to ask the rapporteur to accept the amendment I tabled together with Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPE-DE, requesting recognition for the State’s obligation to guarantee the right to education and the role that the private sector can play in making the universal right to education, which sadly is currently the most violated right, a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This might be common sense, but it is also a choice in terms of development strategies. It is a question of priorities. Some people claim that education is an optional extra and that what is really needed is work, even low paid work requiring no qualifications. I believe that the low cost option tends to create perverse self-perpetuating mechanisms and that education is not an optional extra. Education and training involve an effort to provide opportunities to all individuals, in order to give the greatest number of people the ability to form part of society and to participate in shaping that society.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has distinguished itself internationally for its adherence to this approach, both in Europe and with regard to those countries whose development we support.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the Commission communication, the content of which fully warrants Parliament’s support. We also congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I simply wish to emphasise some points: the importance of the balance between quality and quantity in education, with a decisive commitment to eradicating illiteracy; the importance of involving local actors in the programmes we support, strengthening the practice of decentralised cooperation; a commitment to achieving gender balance – the education and vocational training of girls and women not only have a direct impact on the economy, but also in the medium term, on changing minds and even on liberating societies; the commitment to protecting education, even in times of conflict and following conflicts and the priority to normalise and improve education and training. I would also add the need for further efforts with regard to training for the purpose of reintegrating ex-combatants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, 65 million girls in the world are deprived of their right to education and we are doing very little to resolve this situation. The framework presented by the Commission, as stated by Mr van den Berg, contains very few proposals for action that specifically promote education for girls. This in itself is serious, but it is even more serious if we take into account the fact that babies whose mothers have not had access to education are twice as likely to suffer from malnutrition and die before the age of five than those whose mothers have completed primary education. Just one or two years of school for the mother reduce the infant death rate by 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">The education of mothers is far more effective in reducing malnutrition than any other measure, including the availability of food. We know that women are a determining factor in development: better-trained women mean a higher level of development for their societies. The strategy to combat poverty and, of course, the fight against AIDS can only be successful if specific emphasis is placed on education for girls. Therefore, and because it is their fundamental right, education must be our priority: high-quality, obligatory, general, public, primary education lasting at least six years.</p>
<p class="contents">Education – I repeat – must be our priority. That is the reason why I shall use my final seconds of speaking time to plead the case, as the rapporteur has done, against including education in the general agreement on trade and services at the next WTO negotiations. The right of boys and girls to education cannot be subject to market laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Wyn said that the proportion of Community aid spent in low-income countries had fallen from 70% in 1990 to 38% now. However, he should remember that in 1990 there was no expansion of assistance to the central and eastern European countries that are about to join the Union and the activities in the Balkans were not part of the picture. The reality is that in absolute figures we have not reduced the effort in favour of the least-developed countries and the really poor developing countries, but have increased the effort in other areas. Therefore, the percentages may be correct but the interpretation is wrong. I hope Mr Wyn will report back to the UK on this because it is something the UK has been slower to realise than some other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree very much with Mr Howitt's remarks about the mid-term review being an occasion to raise the issue of this sector's priority. To put it bluntly, we were disappointed with our partners' priorities, on both education and health, in the planning of what we are doing country by country. This is one reason we are trying to find old money, free it up and reallocate it through cross-cutting initiatives, such as the Fast Track Initiative for education. The water initiative is one other such case. This runs somewhat contrary to our planning methodology, but we are pushing this, and tomorrow I will be raising the issue with our ACP partner governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Junker and others mentioned the essential role of regional languages in these primary education systems. A few months ago in Mali I asked people in a village why they had not started their children at the local primary school a few kilometres away. The answer was that the education in the school was in French, a language they do not speak in the village. Therefore they are excluded from the system. That is quite tough! This is an important point. On the other hand, to be taught a language that reaches beyond the very local sphere is a gateway to the world. There is no easy answer to this question, but it is important to push for a dual solution to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
