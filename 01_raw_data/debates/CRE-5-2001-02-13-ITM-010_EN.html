<p class="contents">What is the conclusion? The conclusion is that rules and monitoring are necessary. I am sure that we will be able to find some point of contention – for example, the issues of traceability and labelling remain unresolved – but given the crucial need for regulation, I feel that this task has been more than adequately performed. It must also be remembered that there are many things at stake in this complex matter of genetically modified organisms: it could even be said that, from many points of view, the role of the European Union itself is at stake with regard to many of its forthcoming commitments, such as the World Trade Organisation reforms, the research programme we are about to launch, the development and employment programmes, the relations which will ensue from the creation of new markets, and the globalisation processes which will lead to the redefinition of economic processes.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as far as GMOs are concerned, we must not forget that the situations in many different countries are different. I would mention, at random, China, South Africa and Mexico, which already grow genetically modified organisms, and other countries such as Cuba which we know are preparing to do so; then there are other countries again, such as Nigeria, Thailand and the Philippines, which are extremely interested in the potential offered by biotechnologies.</p>
<p class="contents">So the question is this: what role does the Union intend to play in a future which has already become present reality? I feel that the answer which is most relevant to the European Parliament's role can only be to set a course and establish a strategy which reflect a position of total involvement. This does not mean either accepting or rejecting, and still less bringing forward or extending the time frames. Above all, it means giving a sort of green light to all studies, applications or patents relating to biotechnologies. The Bowe report has more than succeeded in achieving this result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are to obtain more stringent risk assessment requirements. The long-term effects of the many authorisations are also to be looked into. We are to have better monitoring, and we are to see time limits placed upon individual authorisations. I think that all this together will make an important contribution to the protection of the environment and the protection of public health. However, I have a couple of questions for the Commission about a number of matters I think it is important to have clarified today, for there are, of course, still a number of deficiencies in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would ask the Commission to give an assurance today that, whenever we devise vertical legislation in different areas concerned with GMO crops, we also make sure that this vertical legislation respects the general directive we are now adopting on releases into the environment. My second question concerns labelling and traceability, for I really find it worrying that the Commission has not by now been in a position to submit a proposal on labelling. On this matter too, however, I would ask that we be given a more detailed explanation of the letter sent by Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Wallström to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and stating the desire to provide citizens with better information on GMOs. I do not think that the word “better” is enough. It is important for full information to be given and for there not, therefore, to be a system provided in which there are still a whole lot of gaps in the information given to consumers about GMOs. We are not interested in buying a pig in a poke. It is important that we obtain real consumer choice and that short measure is not given in this area. I therefore hope that we can obtain a statement on this issue today.</p>
<p class="contents">I could also do with an assurance from the Commission that, as has been mentioned, the way to new authorisations will not be opened until the new rules have come into force in 2002. The desire to insert conditions corresponding to the new rules in any authorisations given before the law comes into force is, of course, very commendable. However, if the law has not come into force, then it will not, of course, be possible to enforce these rules if the authorised businesses contravene them. I am therefore definitely of the view that one ought to respect the fact that the legislation must come into force before a start is made on issuing authorisations under the new rules. That is the only way we can be sure that it will, in actual fact, also be possible to enforce the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Liberal Group would agree with this, although naturally there is still room for improvement, for example regarding the protection of biodiversity, but these are matters to be revisited at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary objective of the new directive is the safety of the environment and public health. It follows logically from this that although it may be acceptable to use GMOs, there must always be systematic, independent and in-depth research prior to the release, into the potential risks to the environment and to public health. What is important in this respect is that the directive introduces mandatory monitoring after the placing on the market of GMO products and a mandatory time limitation of maximum ten years for first-time consent. This will enable us to encourage research into and use of GMOs on the one hand, whilst still being able to monitor the situation. Comprehensive information promotes the consumer’s freedom of choice. The consumer must be able to have absolute certainty as to whether a particular product does or does not contain GMOs. The only way to do this is through labelling which is the very model of clarity. So we are pleased to hear that the Commission is planning to produce proposals along these lines in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am delighted that the Commission has pledged to bring forward proposals for supplementary liability provisions for the various types of environmental damage in all areas of the European Union, before the end of this year. It is still extremely important to keep a close eye on all the risks of damage to the environment and public health, and to restrict them using all possible means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The answer is, quite clearly, no, it will not. We must pursue the moratorium since the revised 90/220 Directive does not meet all the requirements that we stipulated at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">While there has been some improvement, amongst other things, in the biological monitoring of future affected areas, inasmuch as it is possible to actually identify such areas, this will, however, be at the discretion of the relevant authorities. The final compromise does not respond to consumer concerns, since consumers would like to see guarantees of food safety and to see proper assessment of the risks of releasing GMOs into the environment being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis could have been avoided, had more courageous decisions been taken as soon as the first warning signs emerged. We must not make the same mistake twice. I hope that the Commission will shortly outline proposals to guarantee the complete traceability of GMOs and to establish a reliable labelling system for all GMO-derived products. Only then will we be able to authorise the release of GMOs into the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to point out the concerns that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Parliament had at first and second reading. I do not think that we can talk about all of them now, in the time that we have, but I will mention the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes, the need to respect the Cartagena commitment (the international agreement), the civil responsibility clause, preventing this cultivation from being extended to other plants, the public register of plantations and the localisation of genetically modified organisms and the very serious subject of exports with initial consent and agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these concerns were taken up during the conciliation procedure, but there are others that are still a commitment and some others that may require long periods of time, for example the disappearance of the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes. In our opinion there are currently public health problems related to resistance to antibiotics, and there are infections that used to be cured with common antibiotics which cannot now be cured, not only naturally, but due to genetically modified products, due to the presence of other antibiotics, for example in livestock. However, the time-scales are long and the problem is already there. We think that there are other promises, which are only promises, that can be fulfilled, that perhaps the Commission is fulfilling, but we think that the moratorium should continue until all of this legislation is in force, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by saying that this afternoon there was a speech from Mr Fischler in which he spoke about the economic catastrophe that BSE represents for Europe. Let us not fall into this error again, that is, let us not take measures in a hurry, taking into account economic interests, if this carries risks for food safety and could later be an economic catastrophe as well as a food catastrophe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In short, biotechnology is bringing about a real revolution in science, economics and politics. A revolution that brings hope but which also involves risks. Therefore, the ‘yes, because I say so’ or ‘no, because I say so’ forms of fundamentalism will get us nowhere. The answer lies in a fair balance between the freedom to conduct research and the need to protect public health and the environment. I feel that this revision of the directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms respects this balance because, on the one hand, it does not impose restrictions on research or experiments and on the other, it lays down clearer and more restrictive rules on the release of GMOs into the environment, thereby protecting consumers and biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the revision of this directive will only be complete when the Commission goes ahead with legislative initiatives that implement, in a way that leaves no room for doubt, the principles that are now being declared on imposing responsibility for the environment and for the labelling and traceability of products containing GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of us believe that biotechnology has a glorious future ahead, whilst others are sceptical and point to the dangers, the risks and the scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has three tasks when it comes to the issues surrounding GMOs, the first being to create a vision. A vision that points the way and is broadly based. That is precisely what Parliament has had such a struggle with. The parliamentary majority swings back and forth between the position of NGOs and that of the business community. Given the polarisation of opinion, sound admission procedures are a must, i.e. procedures that guarantee safety, afford the consumer and the environment protection and uphold the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The review of Directive 90/220 strikes a good balance, the best in the world in fact. I think that we, together with the rapporteur, can be proud of the negotiated outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second task is to take decisions and to foster decision making. We must put an end to all the legal uncertainty within the industry. A tricky situation has arisen within the industry in recent years. There is a <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratorium but no decision has ever been taken to this effect. We must make a breakthrough here, but this will only be possible if there are sufficient safeguards for consumers and if we can offer them legal certainty. Consumers must have a choice and the Commission must provide guarantees to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s third task is to take responsibility. If we want to give the go-ahead, then we must also be prepared to take the responsibility that goes with it. Why not give ourselves some encouragement by pointing out that the old situation was worse and that it will be possible for there to be a moratorium in the new situation. But as I see it, we must also have the courage to say that with this directive, we have incorporated sufficient safeguards to give biotechnology a chance in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Each product must be examined in order to ascertain whether it satisfies requirements, but our responsibility goes further than that. Parliament must continue to press for a form of monitoring of the social implications of biotechnology. The assessment must not be restricted to matters of safety alone. The usefulness to society of biotechnological inventions must form part of the assessment carried out by governments and the business community, so that we can go a step beyond the safety aspect. This will benefit consumers all over the world, as well as industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And is the fact that they are planning to replace them not the same as admitting that they are dangerous, contrary to what they have always maintained hitherto?</p>
<p class="contents">So let us not lose sight of the fact that all those transgenic plants which it is intended to release into the environment and onto the markets carry these markers, which means that there are two conflicting truths, and where there are two conflicting truths, one is always a lie. I am in no way opposed to science, but I am against reckless scientists whose thoughts are often of the gold mine of patents rather than the advance of knowledge.

It was human beings that brought a plague of rabbits to America and Australian muskrats that undermine the Dutch dykes. Subsequently, human beings saddled the world with chemical waste dumps and dumping sites for radioactive waste. Recently, we have let an AIDS epidemic run riot and we have allowed mad cow disease to develop. This has all come about owing to a combination of ignorance, impatience, laziness and pursuit of profit. If we had known then what we know now, I am sure we would have done things differently.</p>
<p class="contents">If, before long, people start getting ill from consuming new products, existing plants and animals are supplanted by other species, and existing living beings are no longer resistant to new diseases, then we will know that we have made another big mistake. So we have every reason to restrict our activities to scientific research for the time being, and to isolate all new products that emerge from this. Unfortunately, we are now giving way to the pressure exerted by industry to permit commercial applications. This is undoubtedly highly lucrative for these companies, but it will cost society as a whole enormously in the longer term. It seems that the choice with regard to genetic modification is now between maintaining the old regulation, which is poor, but which does at least include a moratorium, and a new regulation, which is somewhat better but will abolish the moratorium. I have noted that the actual choice cannot be made on the basis of this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In France, the press gave a great deal of coverage to the European Parliament vote on this directive at second reading. French and European citizens alike are expecting the Members they elected to have a clear standpoint – the scandals involving contaminated blood and mad cow disease should give them a right to this, as if any justification were necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with other Members, I believe that the findings of the Conciliation Committee fall far short of alleviating the concerns voiced by European society. The notorious lack of any requirement for traceability is a source of provocation to all the people who wish, quite legitimately, to be kept informed. Yet, the right to information is not always acknowledged. The proposed regulations must guarantee the reliable labelling and traceability of GMOs and derived products. In addition, we must ensure that those who produce and release GMOs are held responsible. We must denounce the lobbying by unscrupulous laboratories and the multinational companies who represent them.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the final reading of the directive in order to highlight the responsibility of the Council, which failed to adopt all Parliament’s amendments after first reading which went in this direction and which would have produced a quite different text. What is going to be adopted as the definitive text is in danger of completely invalidating the moratorium of June 1999, whereas the precautionary principle would instead put the lives and health of men and women before any other considerations, especially financial considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now nearing the end of a long debate which started as long ago as December 1996 when the Commission presented the report on the review of Directive 90/220 concerning GMOs. During that period the European public has become increasingly aware of the application of new technologies and has raised genuine and rightful concerns, in particular, with respect to the different ways that biotechnology can affect everyday life. The Commission has no doubt that this piece of legislation responds to these concerns in a transparent and responsible manner and constitutes an important first milestone towards restoring public and market confidence. During the debate, several Members of Parliament reminded the Commission of its intention to present appropriate proposals concerning traceability and labelling of GMOs and products derived from them.</p>
<p class="contents">The process has already started and I can confirm that the interservice consultation within the Commission on a draft proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning traceability and labelling of GMOs was launched yesterday and will be decided in the Commission at the beginning of March.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will, among other things, ensure that each consumer product which contains a GMO will be marked as such on the label. It will also ensure that GMOs can be identified at all stages of the production chain. It will allow control measures for withdrawal from the market in case of unforeseen events after placing on the market and appropriate labelling. By June 2001 the Commission will present labelling proposals which are designed to give consumers more information about food derived from GMOs. We are in particular considering moving away from the present approach of the DNA-protein criterion. Such an approach will give consumers maximum choice between genetically modified and conventional products. These proposals will include processed food in the labelling systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will again reaffirm the Commission's intention to present before the end of the year, a proposal for a directive on environmental liability which will include GMOs. As I said before, we are now approaching the end of a long debate concerning the revision of Directive 90/220. This text already includes general legal obligations concerning traceability and labelling. It will set the basic rules for an overall legislative framework in biotechnology. It is therefore of the utmost importance that this directive is adopted now, paving the way towards a strict, transparent, efficient and predictable authorisation system for GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having heard what has been said by my colleagues tonight, I want first of all to say how much I appreciate the kind words about the work I have done in the last three years and how delighted I am with the final outcome: a set of legislation which will provide the toughest laws on GMOs in the world. There is no question that this House and the other European institutions will be taking their responsibilities to the people of Europe seriously when they approve this legislation tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point of confusion which I wish to clear up. Many speakers have spoken about the problem of a moratorium. This is an informal gentleman's agreement, as it is called, between the Commission and the Council. Approving our legislation tomorrow will do nothing to lift this moratorium or change the situation with regard to the moratorium. That is a decision that has to be taken between the Member States and the Commission. What they do will decide what happens to the moratorium, not what we do tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must do tomorrow is support this piece of legislation because without it we do not go forward, we go backwards. Without it, we do not go forward into a strong regime of legislative control, we go backwards to the old directive, the discredited directive, which is of no use to any of us. It has caused the Commission and the Council to halt the approval of GMOs and has caused this Parliament to work for nearly three years on replacing it.</p>
<p class="contents">We know very well that this is just the first step in the process. There is other legislation under way. We had the privilege – and I thank the Commission for this – of seeing its draft legislation, the regulation which has already today been passed for consultation within the Commission. At first appearance, this document seems to be an important and very good step in the right direction and I am sure it is going to join the 92/20 revised directive within months as part of the legislative framework to control GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say to the House that we must accept our responsibilities. We must do what we have to do for the people of Europe and that is to support this piece of legislation tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
